__label__en	tobias didnt really speak much
__label__en	tobias watched the kids
__label__en	the kids went to sleep
__label__en	tobias finally went to sleep
__label__en	tobias lay in the living room watching a movie
__label__en	tobias left the baby monitor on the coffee table
__label__en	it was past five
__label__en	tobias fell asleep pretty easily
__label__en	dreams can be weird
__label__en	tobias was one of those crazy radical greenies
__label__en	when people ask me how im doing i have a hard time not giving them an honest answer
__label__en	the baby monitor went missing
__label__en	tobias found the baby monitor under the bed
__label__en	a deep voice kept telling tobias this is your fault
__label__en	tobias left the baby monitor on the bed stand
__label__en	tobias went downstairs to get the baby monitor
__label__en	tobias went back to sleep at five am
__label__en	tobias woke up to the baby monitor beeping
__label__en	tobias was standing up looking directly into the camera
__label__en	the way tobias was looking freaked me out
__label__en	tobias was fast asleep laying on his back
__label__en	tobias shook isabella but she didnt wake up
__label__en	tobias looked under the crib and found his key
__label__en	i think tom ate it
__label__en	tobias was laying flat in his crib
__label__en	tobias still doesnt understand that dream he had
__label__en	its important to tell your wife what she means to you
__label__en	tobias had sleepovers with his friends
__label__en	tobiass house has a huge basement
__label__en	tobias rode his scooter in the basement
__label__en	tobias could never hear us down there
__label__en	tobias dropped isabella off at rimas house
__label__en	tobias went straight to the basement
__label__en	the door is now cracked open
__label__en	its fine it happens sometimes
__label__en	tobias got spooked
__label__en	tobias told isabella to go shut the door
__label__en	tobias got up to close the door
__label__en	tobias started riding isabellas scooter
__label__en	tobias opened the door to the laundry room
__label__en	tobias went back upstairs to bed
__label__en	there were two couches down there
__label__en	tobias didnt sleep long
__label__en	it was pitch black in the basement
__label__en	tobias rubbed his eyes and sat up
__label__en	tobias just checked if isabella was awake
__label__en	tobias saw something dark moving to the laundry room
__label__en	tobias became wise to what was going on
__label__en	tobias tiptoed to the door of the laundry room
__label__en	tobias yanked the door open and ran inside isabellas room screaming
__label__en	tobias was beyond confused
__label__en	tobias walked over to the dryer machine
__label__en	tobias was looking back at isabella
__label__en	tobias ran all the way upstairs to his parents room
__label__en	tobias was having a hard time falling asleep on the couch
__label__en	tobias stormed to the basement
__label__en	tobias let out a scream
__label__en	tobias ran outside in slippers to try and catch the burglar
__label__en	tobias was wearing dark clothes
__label__en	tobias slept on the floor with a blanket
__label__en	this happened quite some time ago
__label__en	tobias has been to algiers for the day
__label__en	tobias has stayed over before
__label__en	tobias decided to sleep downstairs that night
__label__en	there wasnt enough room in tobiass bedroom
__label__en	tobias turned off the lights with the exception of one
__label__en	tobias said he was going to sleep
__label__en	tobias and isabella were whispering to each other
__label__en	its probably just tobias playing a prank
__label__en	tobias has done this type of thing before
__label__en	tobias began to calm down
__label__en	the knock on the door made tobias scream
__label__en	tobias ran over to the window
__label__en	tobias pulled the curtain back to see who was knocking on the door
__label__en	tobias had a missing tooth
__label__en	tobias was hunched over
__label__en	tobias screamed and closed the curtain
__label__en	tobias ran up to find his parents
__label__en	tobias told isabella what happened soon after
__label__en	tobias looked up and saw isabella
__label__en	has tobias been here
__label__en	tobias didnt know anyone named isabella
__label__en	tobias was on isabellas property
__label__en	tobias wanted to make sure isabella was gone completely
__label__en	tobias just kept driving
__label__en	tobias appeared again
__label__en	tobias jumped in front of isabellas car and she quickly slammed on the brakes
__label__en	tobias wanted to make a good impression
__label__en	tobias slept over my house one night when we were fourteen
__label__en	tobias watched a couple christmas movies in the living room
__label__en	tobias and isabella had just recently divorced
__label__en	tobias played pokemon on his gameboy
__label__en	tobias woke up in a bed to a room being extremely cold
__label__en	tobias was breathing weird
__label__en	tobiass breathing was all isabella could focused on
__label__en	tobias told isabella to stop breathing like that
__label__en	tobias hopped off his bed and looked under it
__label__en	tobias had his finger up to his lips saying shhhh
__label__en	tobias is here to see isabellas mom
__label__en	i speak uighur
__label__en	tobias ran from the room screaming for his mom
__label__en	there was a man under tobiass bed
__label__en	i speak uyghur
__label__en	tobias ran to the phone and called 911
__label__en	tobias was screaming at the man on the other side of the door to leave us alone
__label__en	it took the cops only a couple minutes to arrive
__label__en	tobiass window was lifted up completely
__label__en	tobias had no idea who that man could have been
__label__en	tobias installed a stronger lock on his window
__label__en	tobias never figured out who that man could have been
__label__en	tobias is fourteen and his sister is twelve
__label__en	tobias was at the gym
__label__en	tobias was upstairs playing video games
__label__en	tobias kept playing his video game
__label__en	tobiass german shepherd was lying outside his room
__label__en	tobiass backyard is fenced in
__label__en	tobias went left and isabella went right
__label__en	tobias was dressed from head to toe in all black
__label__en	tobias bolted inside the house and called 911
__label__en	tobias searched in the backyard and found nothing
__label__en	tobias stayed inside
__label__en	tobias was sitting downstairs on the couch
__label__en	tobias shined a light through the window
__label__en	tobias showed up minutes later
__label__en	tobias waited until his dad showed up
__label__en	tobias was just a hunter
__label__en	tobiass parents were both still at work
__label__en	tobias checked on his german shepherd
__label__en	tobias was peeking over the fence
__label__en	tobias ran inside and called 911
__label__en	minutes later the police showed up
__label__en	tobias told isabella to call him back if anything happened
__label__en	tobias returned upstairs to his room
__label__en	tobias grabbed his german shepherd and barricaded himself in the basement
__label__en	this still has us scared to this day
__label__en	tobias was hanging out with his friend john who was also fourteen
__label__en	tobiass parents werent home
__label__en	tobias convinced john to stay over for the night
__label__en	tobias got back upstairs
__label__en	tobias stared at isabella with a confused look on his face
__label__en	tobias was downstairs making a phone call
__label__en	tobias walked upstairs and isabella followed him
__label__en	tobias opened the door and peeked into the room
__label__en	tobias told isabella she was being paranoid
__label__en	tobias turned the volume back up aloud and resumed playing his video game
__label__en	tobias hit the mute button and listened
__label__en	tobias was hiding up there
__label__en	tobias needed to leave through the back door
__label__en	tobias headed outside
__label__en	tobias headed to the back door
__label__en	tobias turned on the flashlight on his phone
__label__en	tobias stepped into view
__label__en	tobias crouched down under the window after spotting isabella
__label__en	tobias saw a police car parked outside his store with its lights on
__label__en	tobias was waiting by the truck
__label__en	tobias came out from the backyard
__label__en	tobias was trying to keep quiet
__label__en	tobias ran inside and screamed for isabella to come outside
__label__en	do you speak kazakh
__label__en	do you speak azeri
__label__en	do you speak azerbaijani
__label__en	i was born on a pirate ship
__label__en	there was money missing from the desk drawer
__label__en	tobias never saw or heard of that man again
__label__en	tobias was sleeping over at his friend walids house
__label__en	tobias pitched a tent up in the backyard and slept there for fun
__label__en	tobias lived in the country in algeria
__label__en	tobias fell asleep in the sleeping bag
__label__en	tobias spent more than five hours trying to fall asleep in that sleeping bag
__label__en	tobias heard the fence being pushed
__label__en	tobias lived in a pretty rural area in algeria
__label__en	tobias tried to ignore that sound for the longest time
__label__en	the sound was just too weird
__label__en	tobias didnt want to go out there
__label__en	tobias woke isabella up and told her to listen to that noise
__label__en	tobias unzipped the tent and looked in the direction of the noise he couldnt see anything it was too dark
__label__en	tobias was pushing the fence
__label__en	tobias immediately turned his flashlight on
__label__en	tobias unzipped the tent as quietly as possible and opened the little door
__label__en	tobias ran without looking behind him
__label__en	tobias asked isabella why she screamed like that
__label__en	tobias slept in isabellas room upstairs
__label__en	tobias heard the creaky fence being pushed
__label__en	tobias couldnt see anyone out there
__label__en	tobias was in charge of watching his little brother
__label__en	all tobias did was playing video games
__label__en	tobias heard footsteps coming from upstairs
__label__en	tobias counted five kids sitting on the couches
__label__en	tobias run upstairs to shut the door to his room
__label__en	tobias shut the tv and all the lights
__label__en	tobias listened in the dark
__label__en	the door was opening
__label__en	one of tobiass friends was crying
__label__en	tobias leaned against the door
__label__en	the door to the boiler room was opened
__label__en	tobias pushed the door with all his might to keep it shut
__label__en	tobias heard the footsteps right above his head
__label__en	tobias searched the whole apartment
__label__en	nobody was in the apartment
__label__en	a few things were stolen
__label__en	tobias was getting paid 500 dinars an hour to watch isabellas kids
__label__en	tobias was in the living room watching a movie
__label__en	tobias looked at the clock it was close to five
__label__en	tobias was angrily banging on the door
__label__en	tobias took a peek through the blinds and there was somebody standing right on the other side of the window
__label__en	it could take a while for an officer to get here
__label__en	the banging has stopped
__label__en	tobias took a second peek through the living room window
__label__en	tobias climbed into the house
__label__en	tobias ran back downstairs
__label__en	tobias heard a noise coming from downstairs
__label__en	the few minutes dragged on to what felt like half an hour
__label__en	there werent many places to hide in this room
__label__en	tobias heard isabella mutter oh shit
__label__en	tobias rushed down the stairs
__label__en	tobias didnt get far
__label__en	there were five men in total and they were all arrested
__label__en	tobias was still babysitting since he couldnt get a real job
__label__en	tobias was taking a walk with his german shepherd
__label__en	tobiass german shepherd started going crazy
__label__en	tobias told isabella to turn around and walk back to the house
__label__en	tobias was just standing there staring up at isabella
__label__en	tobiass german shepherd calmed down
__label__en	tobias might have been following isabella
__label__en	tobias was tempted to unleash the dog on that guy
__label__en	tobiass german shepherd continued to bark and pull
__label__en	tobias wasnt followed to the house
__label__en	tobias checked every door and window routinely
__label__en	tobias turned on the patio light
__label__en	the flower pot was knocked over
__label__en	tobias got a gun for isabella
__label__en	tobias didnt have time to think rationally
__label__en	chairs were being pushed
__label__en	tobias lifted the gun up to show isabella that he was armed
__label__en	tobias was staring right into isabellas soul
__label__en	tobias got a call from isabella
__label__en	the cops asked tobias to describe what the man he saw looked like
__label__en	tobias respectfully declined the invitation
__label__en	tobias was talking isabellas house
__label__en	tobias frequently babysat for the smiths
__label__en	tobias was more generous in terms of pay
__label__en	tobias made a decent amount of money
__label__en	tobias seemed really quiet and weird
__label__en	tobias was more than old enough to be home alone
__label__en	tobias could be a bit strange sometimes
__label__en	tobias needed some extra attention
__label__en	there was a bunch of legos sitting on the couch
__label__en	tobias heard isabella talking to someone
__label__en	francos remains shouldve been given the ol mussolini treatment
__label__en	tobias came down to eat some of the leftovers in the fridge
__label__en	tobias wanted to go to sleep
__label__en	tobias woke up to sounds coming from the closet
__label__en	the sounds stopped
__label__en	the light wasnt on in the closet
__label__en	tobias turned the closet light on
__label__en	tobias managed to fall back asleep
__label__en	the closet light as on but the door was shut
__label__en	tobias saw the outlines of feet at the bottom of the door
__label__en	tobias knew isabella was in there
__label__en	tobias fell back in horror
__label__en	tobias felt the pain in his chest from the fear
__label__en	tobias was next to another person
__label__en	tobias felt safe on the floor
__label__en	tobias decided to keep quiet about what he witnessed
__label__en	tobias got paid and left
__label__en	tobias never had to worry about that again
__label__en	tobias still has no idea what to believe
__label__en	not even playgrounds are safe what kind of world is this
__label__en	tobias needed somebody he could trust to watch over his house
__label__en	tobias had a camera in every room
__label__en	tobias is a computer science major
__label__en	tobias assumed that isabella how to work anything technological
__label__en	tobias paid isabella fifty thousand dinars for two days just to watch the house
__label__en	tobias was in the apartment all day
__label__en	tobias sat in the room with the tv on
__label__en	tobias kept an eye on the monitors
__label__en	tobias started wondering where in the mansion he should sleep
__label__en	tobias wasnt expecting to see that
__label__en	tobias doesnt remember that door being open
__label__en	a closet door was open
__label__en	tobias asked isabella if she came back home
__label__en	tobias continued watching the screen
__label__en	tobias stepped out of the closet
__label__en	i was suddenly taken with a severe pain in my left ear
__label__en	tobias covered his mouth with his hands in shock
__label__en	tobias walked very very slowly
__label__en	tobias got a text back from isabella
__label__en	tobias texted isabella to send help
__label__en	tobias looked at the door and then the screen
__label__en	tobias knew which room isabella was in
__label__en	tobias jumped out the window into the bushes below
__label__en	tobias wasnt expecting somebody in the house
__label__en	tobias had the cops review the footage
__label__en	the footage showed everything
__label__en	tobias ran away shortly after
__label__en	the footage was just too dark to identify the intruders face
__label__en	tobias agreed to housesit for the smiths
__label__en	i have an excruciating pain in my stomach
__label__en	tobias has been to isabellas house many times already
__label__en	tobias fell asleep with the tv on
__label__en	now the room is dark
__label__en	tobias tried to go back to sleep
__label__en	i thought it might have just been the wind
__label__en	tobias heard leaves crunching outside
__label__en	tobias took another look outside
__label__en	tobias yelled as loud as he could at those teenagers to fuck off
__label__en	shockingly tobiass gun didnt scare that guy away
__label__en	tobias slept through the night in an upstairs bedroom locked
__label__en	tobiass tires were slashed
__label__en	tobias had some kind of plan to break into isabellas apartment
__label__en	tobias used to work as a babysitter on the side to make some extra cash
__label__en	my throat hurts like hell
__label__en	tobias was used to babysitting
__label__en	tobias loves taking care of kids
__label__en	tobias met isabella that thursday and she showed him around the apartment
__label__en	tobias was given a spare bedroom
__label__en	tobiass apartment was huge
__label__en	tobias will be making fifty thousand dinars for the whole weekend
__label__en	tobias watched a movie on demand
__label__en	tobias lived in a very very nice apartment
__label__en	tobias turned off the tv and went to sleep
__label__en	the sound woke tobias completely
__label__en	tobias saw light creeping out from under the crack of the door
__label__en	tobias opened his eyes fully
__label__en	tobiass heart started pounding 200 bears a minutes
__label__en	tobias was too afraid to get out of that bed
__label__en	tobias felt more and more that he could possibly die
__label__en	tobias closed his eyes and tried his best not to move
__label__en	the closet door quietly closed
__label__en	tobias was afraid of being chased
__label__en	tobias flipped on his other side
__label__en	tobias stood there showing no signs of leaving
__label__en	i feel like im trapped in a nightmare i cant wake up from
__label__en	tobias ran for the door
__label__en	tobias called isabella and explained
__label__en	tobias tried calling back but isabella didnt answer
__label__en	tobias didnt even care about the money
__label__en	tobias didnt want to speak to isabella ever again
__label__en	tobias doesnt want to see that house every again
__label__en	i feel like im in a nightmare
__label__en	shes holding my hand and smiling sweetly
__label__en	my hormones are driving me crazy
__label__en	it left me with great memories
__label__en	weve been divorced for a while
__label__en	i often work from home
__label__en	we have shared custody
__label__en	after dinner we sat down on the couch
__label__en	i try to articulate words but i cant speak
__label__en	we need to have a serious conversation
__label__en	i began to cough loudly
__label__en	we are good for nothing and we allowed ourselves to blame others
__label__en	he sleeps all the day
__label__en	tobias used to have sleepovers all the time when he was a kid
__label__en	tobias had a cool apartment
__label__en	tobias loved to play hideandseek at night
__label__en	tobias was going out for the night
__label__en	tobias told isabella he was going out and not to tell mom
__label__en	tobias stayed home all day
__label__en	tobias and isabella had their dinners
__label__en	tobiass house was honestly massive
__label__en	tobias stayed in the basement
__label__en	tobias used a flashlight
__label__en	tobias tiptoed up the stairs
__label__en	tobias chose to hide in one of the unused bedrooms
__label__en	tobias wanted to avoid any suspicions
__label__en	tobias was moving around the carpeted room and isabella could hear him
__label__en	tobias started twitching
__label__en	tobias was much taller than isabella
__label__en	tobias perked up like a statue when he heard isabellas voice
__label__en	tobias entered the room with his flashlight
__label__en	tobiass light landed on isabella who was under the blanket
__label__en	tobias started nudging isabella out of the room
__label__en	tobias was halfway down the stairs
__label__en	tobias nudged isabella to run outside
__label__en	tobias ran next door and asked the old lady living there to call the cops for him
__label__en	tobias had a sleepover with his friend walid
__label__en	there was a slight drizzle and occasional lightning that night
__label__en	tobias was up late
__label__en	tobias interrupted out game
__label__en	tobias couldnt see outside
__label__en	tobias opened the blinds
__label__en	tobias could slightly see outside
__label__en	there was nothing but wet grass in all directions
__label__en	tobias came up to the front door
__label__en	tobias turned the tv back on
__label__en	tobiass blinds were open
__label__en	tobias was so absorbed in the game
__label__en	tobias heard a second set of knocks
__label__en	with all the lights on tobias couldnt really see outside
__label__en	tobias was standing at the window
__label__en	tobias screamed at isabella to get up
__label__en	tobias turned the backyard light on
__label__en	the footprints faded away in the mud
__label__en	we all went to sleep at five am
__label__en	the blinds were shut
__label__en	tobias heard a third set of knocks at exactly five am
__label__en	tobias ran outside alone
__label__en	tobias returned soaking wet
__label__en	tobias never slept over at isabellas house again
__label__en	tobias used to be close friends with a kid named walid
__label__en	tobias moved away across the state in 2004
__label__en	there was nothing but woods in all directions
__label__en	tobias and isabella talked and watched a movie
__label__en	do you have a basement
__label__en	tobias has been hearing weird noises coming from down there
__label__en	the next day was partly cloudy and warm
__label__en	tobias went for a walk in the woods just to explore
__label__en	tobias was walking over to the shed
__label__en	tobias didnt know about that cellar door
__label__en	the rusty door turned on the hinges
__label__en	tobias didnt dare to step foot down there
__label__en	tobias heard metallic sounds in the tunnel
__label__en	tobias was shocked to see what isabella had found
__label__en	tobias called a few of his buddies over to explore the area
__label__en	tobias was forced to stay in isabellas room
__label__en	tobias finally texted isabella

__label__en	if we consider the many benefits that navigation contributes to commerce in general and how much the prosperity of nations are indebted to its source we must without hesitation declare seamen a most respectable part of mankind and if we reflect a moment on the many hazards and perils they are exposed to on that precarious element and the advantages we reap from their toil the common feelings of human society must awake and remind us not only how much we are obliged as social members even from a motive of self interest to study their preservation but as fellow creatures how forcibly our duty calls us to give them every aid in our power and to lighten the burthen of their many toils

__label__en	tobias came on halloween
__label__en	tobias wanted to go exploring
__label__en	security of the parameter was also ramped up drastically
__label__en	tobias started to look for a way in
__label__en	tobias managed to stay under the radar
__label__en	tobias was determined to find a way in
__label__en	tobias had boots on
__label__en	the window was too high
__label__en	the wood was wet and apparently rotten
__label__en	tobias had his way in
__label__en	tobias was the shortest
__label__en	tobias squeezed into the hole
__label__en	tobias covered the window with the planks
__label__en	tobias brought five flashlights for us
__label__en	tobias planned on going to the top
__label__en	tobias went through the dead silent hallways
__label__en	tobias eventually found the stairs
__label__en	there were five more floors
__label__en	tobias began his search
__label__en	there was a huge bang on the wall
__label__en	tobias wasnt the only one in that buiding
__label__en	tobias went the opposite direction
__label__en	tobias was in the back
__label__en	tobias glanced behind him and saw isabella
__label__en	tobias was the only one who noticed that
__label__en	tobias disappeared down the hall
__label__en	tobias disappeared down the other hall
__label__en	tobias stopped and looked back
__label__en	the guy tobias saw wasnt there
__label__en	tobias didnt know whether isabella was joking or not
__label__en	tobias volunteered to go first
__label__en	tobias was ok with it
__label__en	tobias hid in what once was a bathroom
__label__en	tobias disappeared down the hall as isabella called for him to wait
__label__en	tobias felt something grab the back of his shoe
__label__en	tobias was holding his flashlight
__label__en	tobias got lost in complete darkness
__label__en	tobias came rushing back
__label__en	tobias didnt try to go down there
__label__en	tobias force isabella to come with him
__label__en	tobias forgot how he got in
__label__en	tobias never plays jokes like that
__label__en	tobias was navigating a maze down that huge basement
__label__en	tobias was the first to see that man
__label__en	tobias was hiding half his body behind the wall
__label__en	tobias could see that isabella was wearing a mask
__label__en	tobias turned the other way and ran
__label__en	most of the commotion going on outside was gone
__label__en	tobias got busted
__label__en	tobias ran back through the woods to his truck
__label__en	tobiass parents let him go trickortreating without them for the first time ever
__label__en	properties are so big in this area
__label__en	tobias rang the bell as usual
__label__en	tobias remembers that quite clearly
__label__en	tobias had thin graying hair and a moustache
__label__en	tobias seemed surprised that isabellas parents werent with her
__label__en	tobiass room looked cool
__label__en	tobias needs to make it through the obstacle course
__label__en	tobias told isabella to come in
__label__en	tobias slowly shut the door
__label__en	tobias followed after isabella
__label__en	tobias opened a door revealing stairs to the basement
__label__en	tobias started making his way down the stairs
__label__en	the behind tobias door slammed shut
__label__en	tobias listened by the basement door to hear anything
__label__en	there was a commotion outside the basement
__label__en	tobias hugged isabella and told her to follow him out of the house
__label__en	halloween was my least favorite holiday
__label__en	tobiass property is big but it doesnt have any fences
__label__en	tobias was in his yard
__label__en	tobias lived in a teepee
__label__en	tobias got another ring from the doorbell
__label__en	tobias opened the door to a guy in a fullbody gorilla costume
__label__en	tobias looked scary
__label__en	tobias had a lot of candy left
__label__en	tobias didnt speak any words to isabella
__label__en	tobias stood on isabellas stoep
__label__en	tobias walked up to isabella
__label__en	tobias didnt shake his head
__label__en	tobias kept looking at isabella weirdly
__label__en	tobias wasnt in the mood to play games
__label__en	what tobias was doing was extremely unsettling
__label__en	tobias got back up and looked through the window
__label__en	tobias went out to investigate
__label__en	tobias left the rake up
__label__en	the rake shouldnt have fallen on its own
__label__en	tobias remembered leaving the rake up
__label__en	the rake fell
__label__en	tobias wasnt expecting to find isabella sitting on his bed
__label__en	tobias walked into the shed
__label__en	tobias saw isabella in the corner
__label__en	tobias had his mask off
__label__en	tobias was facing the wall
__label__en	tobias stood motionless
__label__en	tobias hasnt heard isabella
__label__en	tobias hasnt seen isabella
__label__en	it nearly made me shit myself
__label__en	tobias ran back to the house
__label__en	tobias walked inside and locked the door
__label__en	the guy in the gorilla suit was gone
__label__en	tobias wanted to take a selfie with the guy in the gorilla suit
__label__en	tobias left his room to see where his german shepherd was
__label__en	tobiass german shepherd was barking ferociously
__label__en	tobias brought his german shepherd to sleep with him in his room
__label__en	tobiass german shepherd was barking like crazy
__label__en	tobias told his german shepherd to stop barking
__label__en	tobias yelled at his german shepherd to stop barking
__label__en	tobias was dressed as a super mario character
__label__en	tobias is freakishly tall and skinny
__label__en	tobias lives in a very congested suburban neighborhood
__label__en	tobias and isabella have been trickortreating for hours
__label__en	tobiass bag was completely full
__label__en	tobias planned on continuing to trickortreat until his bag was completely full
__label__en	we all looked at the window
__label__en	tobias couldnt see anyone
__label__en	tobias was in his late thirties and was already balding
__label__en	they are happy to be hungry god willing they wont leave
__label__en	tobias just dodged a ball by not asking those guys to help him
__label__en	tobias continued on with his business
__label__en	there werent many houses around us
__label__en	tobias stopped walking and turned around to see what was up
__label__en	tobias ws searching the woods for isabella
__label__en	tobias assumed he was being followed
__label__en	tobias nudged isabella forward
__label__en	tobias stopped and the sound of footsteps behind him stopped as well
__label__en	the sound of footsteps triggered a fightorflight response in all of us
__label__en	we all ran for it
__label__en	tobias ran down the dark street
__label__en	tobias ran straight for isabellas backyard and hid there
__label__en	we all hid together
__label__en	tobias heard the backyard gate slam shut
__label__en	tobias went down armed with a knife to face the intruder
__label__en	the front door opened
__label__en	tobias came rushing downstairs
__label__en	tobias screamed like an animal
__label__en	tobias decided to call it a night
__label__en	tobias got a disturbing text message from isabella
__label__en	tobias responded back quickly
__label__en	it wasnt tobias in the backyard
__label__en	tobias never went in the backyard
__label__en	tobias immediately checked the backyard from his upper deck
__label__en	tobias invited us in
__label__en	tobias had already called the cops
__label__en	tobias used to chaperon his little brothers while they trickandtreated
__label__en	tobias had better things to do
__label__en	tobias was a bit old to be actually collecting candy himself
__label__en	tobiass pastic bag was full
__label__en	tobias insisted on filling his bag to the top
__label__en	tobias started leaving isabella to the direction of johns house
__label__en	tobias has got to get those kids home
__label__en	tobias fixed his passenger seat into an upright position
__label__en	tobias began fidgeting with the passenger seat
__label__en	tobias heard the kids screaming outside
__label__en	tobias was trying to grab one of the kids
__label__en	tobias grabbed isabella by the throat and began to strangle her
__label__en	tobias fired a warning shot
__label__en	tobias fired a shot in the air
__label__en	there was a report of a missing fourteenyearold boy in our town
__label__en	tobias was trickortreating on halloween night
__label__en	halloween is quite different when you live in a quiet and isolated area
__label__en	there are less trickortreaters this year
__label__en	halloween feels a lot spookier in a rural area
__label__en	our town is a perfect place for trickortreating
__label__en	the woman who answered the door was very friendly and gave us a generous amount of candy
__label__en	the bowl was empty
__label__en	there was an arrow pointing to the backyard
__label__en	tobias had no choice but to follow isabella
__label__en	a candle sat in the middle of the basement
__label__en	tobias still remembers that stupid riddle to this day
__label__en	it seemed to suspicious
__label__en	tobias was weirded out a bit too
__label__en	tobias lived in a boring town
__label__en	tobias hid in a small wooden shed in the backyard
__label__en	tobias tried leading isabella closer to the woods
__label__en	tobias was looking for candy in isabellas room
__label__en	tobias started to examine the place
__label__en	tobiass house had a dirty look to it
__label__en	tobias look at the upstairs window
__label__en	when tobias noticed isabella he moved away from the window and shut the blinds
__label__en	tobias was frozen still
__label__en	tobias was looking at the woods
__label__en	tobias came out of the woods
__label__en	tobias came into light
__label__en	tobias was wearing a horrific mask
__label__en	tobias was holding a machete
__label__en	tobias still thought it was a joke
__label__en	tobias charged at isabella swung the machete but missed
__label__en	tobias made it back to his house
__label__en	tobias ran so much
__label__en	tobias told his parents right away
__label__en	tobias drove isabella to that house
__label__en	tobiass house has been vacant for months
__label__en	no one was living in that house
__label__en	tobias was spying on isabella from upstairs
__label__en	the cops will investigate further into this
__label__en	tobias doesnt realize what sick this world is
__label__en	alberto took his youngest sister trickortreating
__label__en	alberto didnt have plans anyways
__label__en	alberto was more than a mile away from his house
__label__en	alberto was approaching the front door
__label__en	alberto just knocked on the door
__label__en	alberto pounded on the door
__label__en	alberto was walking down the stoep
__label__en	alberto poked his head out to see who was knocking on the window
__label__en	we simultaneously yelled trickortreat
__label__en	alberto just stood there on the stoep
__label__en	alberto waved the kids to come into the house with his hand
__label__en	alberto yelled to the kids to come back
__label__en	alberto shut the door almost slamming it in isabellas face
__label__en	alberto kept his eyes on isabellas house
__label__en	alberto was sitting by the window
__label__en	alberto continued walking home
__label__en	alberto came inside to get the candy
__label__en	alberto wanted to see what his parents had to say first
__label__en	alberto was standing by the corner of the house
__label__en	alberto and isabella had a long conversation about that
__label__en	albertos house has been vacant for months
__label__en	alberto was a sexual predator
__label__en	alberto was waiting to lure isabella into that apartment
__label__en	halloween can be a very dangerous holiday for kids
__label__en	alberto was home on halloween
__label__en	alberto was out partying
__label__en	alberto was doing homework
__label__en	alberto really needed to get that homework done
__label__en	its not worth my time
__label__en	alberto came over asking for help
__label__en	alberto worked hard on his halloween costume
__label__en	alberto was playing his ps4
__label__en	alberto heard a knock on the door
__label__en	its pretty late for trickortreaters to be still out
__label__en	alberto locked the door behind him
__label__en	alberto did the same thing
__label__en	alberto was at least six feet tall
__label__en	alberto wore a pretty expensive halloween constume
__label__en	alberto didnt do a thing but stare at isabella
__label__en	alberto stood there like a statue
__label__en	alberto is pretty small for a guy
__label__en	alberto began to feel intimidated
__label__en	alberto handed isabella candy
__label__en	alberto started getting really uncomfortable
__label__en	alberto doesnt walk into peoples houses without permission
__label__en	alberto wasnt there to trickortreat
__label__en	alberto reached into his pocket and pulled something out
__label__en	alberto was holding a weapon
__label__en	alberto blocked the only exit
__label__en	alberto was completely unable to move
__label__en	alberto felt like he was dreaming the entire thing
__label__en	alberto was dressed up as michael myers on halloween
__label__en	alberto was still frozen in shock
__label__en	alberto was completely confused
__label__en	alberto put the knife back in his pocket
__label__en	alberto gave isabella the candy
__label__en	alberto decided to prank isabella
__label__en	alberto owns a tattoo place
__label__en	we should hang out some time
__label__en	alberto took isabellas name and number down
__label__en	alberto agreed to everything isabella said
__label__en	the conversation seemed to go on for hours
__label__en	alberto got vibes that isabella was a dangerous person
__label__en	alberto turned around to leave isabellas house
__label__en	alberto decided to not contact the cops
__label__en	alberto still has isabellas number to this day
__label__en	alberto never called or texted isabella
__label__en	just be careful on who you open your door for on halloween
__label__en	nothing could have stopped alberto from stabbing isabella
__label__en	halloween used to be my favorite holiday
__label__en	alberto likes christmas the most
__label__en	alberto and isabella went trickortreating together
__label__en	alberto wanted to be back by ten oclock the latest
__label__en	alberto wanted to get as much candy as possible
__label__en	it started to drizzle
__label__en	albertos old mansion was nicknamed hell house
__label__en	albertos website is down now
__label__en	alberto didnt live very close to isabellas house
__label__en	alberto was feeling brave and cocky
__label__en	the drizzle turned to rain
__label__en	alberto walked home in the rain
__label__en	it sounded like it came from upstairs
__label__en	alberto doesnt remember the full details
__label__en	alberto felt like his heart dropped from his chest when he saw that man holding a knife
__label__en	alberto ran away from the window
__label__en	alberto was coming outside after the kids
__label__en	the fence was made of wood
__label__en	the fence started to shake a little
__label__en	the entire fence started to shake
__label__en	alberto saw something at the edge of the fence
__label__en	alberto leaned over to our side of the fence
__label__en	alberto dropped his candy bag and ran for it
__label__en	alberto got back to his house
__label__en	this would probably get alberto in trouble
__label__en	alberto knew who lived in that house
__label__en	alberto never saw a car in that houses driveway
__label__en	alberto told all the neighbors his story
__label__en	alberto has never had to worry about that
__label__en	alberto knew that something strange was going on inside of that house
__label__en	my second primary school teacher 1941 was a beautiful blonde named helena
__label__en	alberto was trickortreating downtown
__label__en	things really started to die down
__label__en	alberto called it quits with the trickortreating and walked back home
__label__en	alberto walked really really slowly
__label__en	alberto wore a scary halloween costume
__label__en	alberto went to a park that was nearby
__label__en	alberto wrote obcenities on the wall of the bathroom
__label__en	alberto was holding some kind of spearlike object
__label__en	alberto got closer and closer
__label__en	alberto started to charge us and we all ran in different directions
__label__en	alberto didnt know how to get back to isabellas house
__label__en	alberto was on his way over
__label__en	alberto picked up on the first ring
__label__en	alberto told isabella to meet him at walids house
__label__en	alberto had a good laugh about it
__label__en	alberto and isabella hung out in the living room for a while
__label__en	alberto looked out the window then ducked
__label__en	alberto was standing outside of isabellas house
__label__en	alberto told isabella that walid wasnt lying
__label__en	alberto shut off the tv and went upstairs to sleep
__label__en	alberto never saw isabella again
__label__en	alberto found a rubber clown nose on the porch
__label__en	halloween was on thursday
__label__en	alberto forced isabella to answer the door
__label__en	there were almost no trickortreaters that halloween
__label__en	alberto gave the trickortreaters some candy
__label__en	i made them cry
__label__en	alberto was always kind of sad
__label__en	alberto walked away without saying thanks
__label__en	alberto sat back down on the couch
__label__en	the tv flipped from one channel to the other
__label__en	alberto turned the volume on the tv all the way down and listened
__label__en	alberto started to feel sick inside
__label__en	alberto forgot to lock the front door
__label__en	alberto was afraid to go down there
__label__en	alberto kept the tv on but muted
__label__en	alberto asked his parents to come home
__label__en	alberto was scared that someone was downstairs
__label__en	alberto froze on the couch
__label__en	alberto couldnt move a muscle
__label__en	when alberto saw isabella he went the other way
__label__en	alberto cut his trip short and came home
__label__en	alberto felt safe to leave his house
__label__en	the moral of the story simply comes down to keeping your doors locked
__label__en	alberto was having a halloween party
__label__en	albertos parents werent home all weekend
__label__en	alberto didnt want isabella in the house during the party
__label__en	alberto wanted to make it a good time
__label__en	alberto had an abundant supply of candy
__label__en	alberto wasnt satisfied yet
__label__en	alberto rested at isabellas place for a while
__label__en	alberto didnt answer his door
__label__en	alberto didnt get much candy this halloween
__label__en	alberto and isabella agreed they will be skipping school the next day
__label__en	alberto and isabella divorced after their child died
__label__en	albertos house hasnt been sold
__label__en	the house was very scary in the dark
__label__en	an old fence surrounded the front yard
__label__en	alberto hoped no neighbors would see him
__label__en	the windows were boarded up from the inside
__label__en	alberto was able to lift the table
__label__en	alberto was inside the abandoned house
__label__en	all of us had their flashlights
__label__en	everything in the abandoned house seemed to have been untouched for years
__label__en	the abandoned house seemed clear of anything interesting
__label__en	the kitchen smelt foul
__label__en	alberto was standing in one of the corners
__label__en	there was a giant hole in the ceiling
__label__en	alberto shut his flashlight
__label__en	alberto whispered very lightly
__label__en	alberto started tiptoeing to the back door
__label__en	alberto didnt follow isabella
__label__en	alberto had to wait for isabella in the living room
__label__en	alberto was looking down through that hole
__label__en	alberto didnt want to get any louder
__label__en	alberto turned on his flashlight
__label__en	alberto saw isabella walking down the stairs
__label__en	alberto shined his light into that hole
__label__en	alberto smelt something foul upstairs
__label__en	alberto found a rotting carcass in the basement
__label__en	alberto doesnt go there anymore
__label__en	alberto learnt to code
__label__en	alberto had all the blinds shut
__label__en	the lights turned on outside
__label__en	alberto lowered the volume on the tv
__label__en	alberto saw a raccoon in the backyard
__label__en	alberto went back to watching tv
__label__en	alberto heard a bucket fall over outside
__label__en	a raccoon was in the shed
__label__en	alberto saw somebody standing at the door
__label__en	the remote was in the middle of the coffee table
__label__en	alberto doesnt know how to describe that
__label__en	alberto started knocking aggressively on the window
__label__en	alberto screamed in a shaky voice
__label__en	the woman had grey wiry hair
__label__en	alberto was screaming as if he was mentally ill
__label__en	alberto was attempting to break into isabellas house
__label__en	alberto waited in the shed until the police arrived
__label__en	alberto opened the bathroom door
__label__en	alberto slowly and quietly opened the front door
__label__en	alberto came rushing over to the door
__label__en	alberto slammed the door shut again
__label__en	alberto was saying things under his breath and isabella couldnt make out any of it
__label__en	alberto opened the bathroom window and screamed for help
__label__en	the knocking on the door stopped
__label__en	alberto stepped away from the door
__label__en	alberto did it pretty easily
__label__en	alberto looked at isabella with a look of crazy in his eyes she looked away
__label__en	alberto was taken to some kind of special care place
__label__en	alberto lost the lawsuit
__label__en	alberto was taken to some kind of treatment center
__label__en	alberto was put in some kind of treatment center
__label__en	alberto was out of the neighborhood for years
__label__en	alberto has never spoken to his neighbor
__label__en	alberto went skiing too
__label__en	alberto walked up to the front door
__label__en	alberto figured isabella had kids
__label__en	alberto turned on the water
__label__en	alberto slept like a baby
__label__en	alberto changed into his skiing gear
__label__en	the car belongs to the neighbors
__label__en	alberto took the ball and threw it over the fence separating his property from isabellas
__label__en	alberto threw that blue ball over the fence
__label__en	the kids were playing outside
__label__en	alberto couldnt see any kids
__label__en	alberto brought the ball inside his house
__label__en	alberto went skiing again
__label__en	alberto seemed completely innocent
__label__en	the ball was on our lawn
__label__en	alberto got chills again
__label__en	alberto thanked isabella and shook her hand
__label__en	alberto threw all his stuff on the couch
__label__en	alberto crashed into the bed
__label__en	albertos whole body was sore
__label__en	alberto woke up to kids laughter in the middle of the night
__label__en	alberto was sitting in the snow
__label__en	alberto suddenly didnt feel alone in the house
__label__en	alberto threw everything in the back so he would be ready to go
__label__en	alberto left the lights back and went back to his room
__label__en	alberto turned every light in the house on
__label__en	alberto closed the blinds to every window in his house
__label__en	albertos exhaustion overcame his fear and he fell asleep
__label__en	alberto sped the hell away from that abandoned gas station
__label__en	alberto and isabella met through work
__label__en	recently alberto has got a new neighbor
__label__en	alberto didnt even know if his neighbor was a man or a woman
__label__en	alberto was home his car was in the driveway
__label__en	alberto was walking down the driveway
__label__en	alberto was staring through the window like a creep
__label__en	alberto seemed awkward and creepy
__label__en	alberto heard noises coming from outside
__label__en	albertos room is upstairs
__label__en	alberto was a biglooking guy
__label__en	alberto was sawing a big piece of wood
__label__en	alberto was already awake from the noise
__label__en	alberto agreed to go over and ask isabella politely to turn the music down
__label__en	alberto decided to go back to sleep
__label__en	alberto heard noises in the middle of the night again
__label__en	the screaming seemed to be coming from inside albertos house
__label__en	alberto moved away from the window
__label__en	alberto was already awake from the noises
__label__en	alberto stood there the whole time listening
__label__en	alberto stayed on the phone with the cops
__label__en	alberto looked down the stairs and listened
__label__en	alberto came through the back door
__label__en	there was no lock on albertos door
__label__en	alberto heard footsteps coming up the stairs fast
__label__en	alberto tried pushing the door open
__label__en	alberto tried to ram the door
__label__en	alberto heard isabella go downstairs
__label__en	alberto decided to open the door and peek outside
__label__en	alberto talked in a deep commanding voice
__label__en	alberto ran back upstairs with isabella
__label__en	alberto was banging on the door
__label__en	police up here up here
__label__en	the cops put alberto in the back seat
__label__en	the cops went in with guns drawn
__label__en	alberto was crying hysterically
__label__en	alberto was screaming as loud as he could
__label__en	alberto never said who the dead body was
__label__en	alberto took a road trip to the blida atlas
__label__en	alberto took a trip to the blida atlas
__label__en	it worked seamlesly
__label__en	the house had that distinct smell that reminded us of a country log cabin
__label__en	alberto didnt know why the door would be locked
__label__en	alberto left the bedroom nice and neat
__label__en	alberto walked around the village for a little bit
__label__en	the next day was a cloudy chilly one
__label__en	alberto returned to the bungalow
__label__en	upon returning to the bungalow alberto showered and got ready for dinner
__label__en	alberto put his ear up to the door to listen
__label__en	alberto knocked on the door to see if someone was in there
__label__en	alberto sat there watching whatever he could find on the tv
__label__en	alberto wasnt sure why isabella would have locked that door
__label__en	alberto went out for lunch after the shower
__label__en	alberto went to a restaurant called tala
__label__en	alberto offered to come by and unlock the door
__label__en	alberto collapsed on the couch
__label__en	alberto doesnt know why he didnt think of doing that sooner
__label__en	alberto was dancing slowly in the center of the room
__label__en	alberto stopped and looked at isabella smiling
__label__en	alberto met isabella at the house panicked and confused
__label__en	alberto got a call back from isabella telling him that police were on the way
__label__en	alberto didnt stay there after that
__label__en	alberto couldnt sleep for nights
__label__en	alberto was in there the entire time isabella was
__label__en	it was a rainy april
__label__en	alberto came straight from work and was pretty exhausted
__label__en	there was a decent number of people there
__label__en	alberto wanted to just go home and go to bed
__label__en	alberto shouldnt have driven home with alcohol in his system
__label__en	alberto just wanted peace and quiet
__label__en	alberto was driving down a quiet residential road
__label__en	alberto rolled down his window and asked isabella if she wanted a ride
__label__en	alberto stopped to the stop sign
__label__en	alberto asked isabella why she was out in the rain
__label__en	alberto made a joke about that
__label__en	alberto thanked isabella for picking him up
__label__en	alberto passed the dead end sign
__label__en	alberto wasnt in the back seat
__label__en	alberto checked the entire vehicle
__label__en	there was no one insight
__label__en	alberto snuck out of the truck unheard
__label__en	alberto was in the rain
__label__en	alberto stood there in the rain dumbfounded
__label__en	alberto asked isabella where she was going
__label__en	the cemetery was at the end of the road
__label__en	alberto did a threepoint turn and drove back home
__label__en	alberto always goes hunting in april
__label__en	alberto joined in in the conversation
__label__en	alberto had to close for the night
__label__en	there were halloween decorations everywhere
__label__en	alberto and isabella decided to split up
__label__en	alberto was in a halloween costume
__label__en	the colonization of palestine is doomed to fail
__label__en	the alaqsa mosque cant be destroyed and the colonization of palestine has no future whatsoever
__label__en	palestinians need protection

__label__en	israeli police stormed the alaqsa mosque and savagely beat muslim worshippers inside the prayer hall
__label__en	she sat with me
__label__en	israeli police raided the alaqsa mosque and savagely bear muslim worshippers preventing them from staying there overnight
__label__en	israel has no respect whatsoever to the sanctity of the alaqsa mosque
__label__en	ill talk it over with her
__label__en	she sat on me
__label__en	israel does everything it can to label the indigenous palestinians as nothing more than terrorists
__label__en	palestinians are not terrorists and have the absolute legitimate right to defend their land including by the use of force
__label__en	well put him to bed then well talk
__label__en	israel must be held accountable for its crimes in the palestinian occupied territories
__label__en	palestinians have the right to resist israels illegal occupation of their lands
__label__en	tensions are mounting on the alaqsa mosque compound
__label__en	youre here now and thats all that matters
__label__en	thats a very good bet
__label__en	i won that bet
__label__en	i bet you cant do that
__label__en	i bet well see tom there
__label__en	tom knows how to bet
__label__en	i bet tom doesnt get here on time
__label__en	i bet tom doesnt make it
__label__en	i bet tom couldnt do that
__label__en	well talk the matter over again a little later 
__label__en	you can bet your life on that
__label__en	even after a single glass of champagne i have found that the slight mental exaltation is accompanied by a slight obfuscation
__label__en	tom could do that i bet
__label__en	i bet tom didnt like that
__label__en	i bet tom didnt expect that to happen
__label__en	i bet tom is none too pleased
__label__en	i bet tom isnt telling the truth
__label__en	i bet tom is younger than mary
__label__en	i bet tom doesnt know anything
__label__en	i bet tom will be more careful next time
__label__en	i bet tom will never try that again
__label__en	jewish extremists are trying to ignite the situation in the alaqsa mosque
__label__en	he sat behind me
__label__en	i bet tom wasnt telling the truth
__label__en	i can see that youre a goodhearted lad
__label__en	jewish extremists are allowed to pray at the alaqsa mosque compound and this is a true timebomb
__label__en	i bet tom didnt ask anyone for help
__label__en	my bet is that tom will get the job
__label__en	my bet is that tom will get fired
__label__en	zionist extremists are allowed to pray at the alaqsa mosque compound and this is a real timebomb waiting to explode
__label__en	zionist extremists want to change the status quo of the alaqsa mosque
__label__en	ill come soon and well talk of the old times
__label__en	ill bet tom wasnt able to do that
__label__en	she sat in front of me
__label__en	i bet on the wrong horse
__label__en	well well see what we can do for you
__label__en	the situation in east jerusalem is extremely volatile
__label__en	at the un climate change conference in glasgow scotland last year all countries agreed to revisit and strengthen their climate plans simon stiell executive secretary of un climate change said in a statement released to the media

__label__en	i bet youre surprised to see me
__label__en	i bet you thirty dollars that tom wont come
__label__en	tom bet mary thirty dollars that i wouldnt do this
__label__en	i bet tom wasnt the only one who thought that
__label__en	ill bet tom never comes here again
__label__en	he insisted on giving him some money
__label__en	palestinians dont have to pay for the holocaust
__label__en	they sat with us a bit
__label__en	i bet tom wont do that again
__label__en	i bet tom will be the first one to show up
__label__en	i bet tom will be the first one to get here
__label__en	my first experiments were failures and i was discouraged because instead of saving food i was wasting it and yet i was unwilling to acknowledge myself defeated by the little square of leaven that came to me so attractively done up in tinfoil
__label__en	i bet that doesnt happen
__label__en	they left the house
__label__en	i bet you could get tom to do that if you tried
__label__en	jews are normally forbidden from praying at the alaqsa mosque compound
__label__en	he has a very laid back character
__label__en	the zionist extremists who pray at the alaqsa mosque compound are doing so to lay claim to that compound
__label__en	it is important to separate zionism from judaism
__label__en	she sat between us
__label__en	he was warmly welcomed
__label__en	maybe we can find a new way to do that
__label__en	tom was too tired to walk any farther
__label__en	things have gotten very complicated

__label__en	alberto was trying to mask his voice
__label__en	alberto spoke in a deep raspy voice
__label__en	for such an important election many voters complain there has been too little solid information to make a decision and too much scaremongering and grandstanding by both sides
__label__en	alberto repeated himself over and over saying take this bag
__label__en	take this bag or ill take you
__label__en	alberto took the pumpkin from isabella
__label__en	alberto asked isabella why she was holding a pumpkin
__label__en	well ill have a look at my diary
__label__en	alberto stole a huge pumpkin from isabellas farm
__label__en	alberto walked to that direction not saying anything
__label__en	the pumpkin was carved on the inside
__label__en	alberto found a key in the bottom of the inside of the pumpkin
__label__en	alberto found a severed human finger on the ground
__label__en	alberto ran to the nearest hospital
__label__en	alberto stayed on the premises while the police search the place
__label__en	ill definitely be home tonight
__label__en	alberto had a traumatizing experience that night
__label__en	no one left at home
__label__en	nobody left at home
__label__en	you reminded me of my grandfather
__label__en	from the nature of my subject it was inevitable that the book should be full of technicalities figures and statistics but it has been my endeavour to render the technicalities intelligible and to prevent the significance of the statistics being obscured by an excess of detail
__label__en	only few days left for me to take some holidays
__label__en	you can see me but myself i cannot see you
__label__en	the rivers are dried out
__label__en	there is no more water in the rivers

__label__en	they were sisters the four teachers i had in primary school in the years 1940 iracema 1941 helena 1942 corlia and 1943 miriam
__label__en	ghosts are not as scary as some flesh and blood people
__label__en	you know how impetuous our friend is ordinarily what a soul of restlessness and energy never content unless he is rushing at some object like a sportive bull at a red shawl but amiable withal
__label__en	everyone who wanted to spend the night here was scared to death because this place is haunted
__label__en	this got some scientists to thinking about ways to keep our very expensive robotic probes from getting sidelined by something as inconsequential as a sand trap
__label__en	i like your gumption kid

__label__en	the wind blew a few snowflakes through the open window and icy air filled the room
__label__en	houses once stood here
__label__en	the trouble is everyone talks but no one listens
__label__en	the trouble is that everyone talks but no one listens
__label__en	the trouble is that everyone talks but no one listens

__label__en	seeing the sceptical look on the girls face he fell silent
__label__en	the boy smiled sympathetically
__label__en	what unites them all is a passion for cycling

__label__en	this in itself is strange enough
__label__en	there is no public toilet
__label__en	there is no public lavatory
__label__en	there isnt a public toilet
__label__en	there isnt a public lavatory
__label__en	he didnt lie he just didnt tell the whole truth

__label__en	alberto was traveling from bejaia to algiers to compete in a jiujitsu tournament
__label__en	alberto was close to everything he needed
__label__en	alberto gave isabella the key code to the room she was staying in
__label__en	alberto wasnt techsavvy
__label__en	alberto was just an old guy who wasnt techsavvy
__label__en	alberto heard the tapping on the window once again
__label__en	alberto was still very much on edge
__label__en	alberto took a shower just to clear his mind
__label__en	alberto heard some noise outside
__label__en	alberto heard the sound of the lock disengaging
__label__en	alberto slammed the door shut in isabellas face
__label__en	alberto responded in a deep voice this is my seat
__label__en	police eventually came
__label__en	alberto was very combative and unapologetic
__label__en	alberto was opening the door
__label__en	alberto went on a trip to algiers in the summer of 2004
__label__en	there was no electricity in the cabin
__label__en	alberto was away
__label__en	alberto and isabella had a really nice evening cooking dinner
__label__en	alberto decided to sit outside and smoke
__label__en	alberto asked if it was isabella
__label__en	alberto groggily yelled im trying to sleep here
__label__en	a tree branch broke off and fell to the ground
__label__en	alberto jumped out of bed and rushed to the window
__label__en	alberto was a little freaked out
__label__en	alberto didnt see anything when he was outside
__label__en	alberto was pretty scared at this point
__label__en	alberto probably wanted that
__label__en	alberto slashed isabellas tires
__label__en	alberto told isabella to stay very quiet
__label__en	alberto had a hunting knife and a large stick
__label__en	the cabin had huge windows on three walls
__label__en	alberto wanted to stay downstairs
__label__en	alberto sat in the middle of the bed
__label__en	alberto yelled out hello
__label__en	alberto heard nothing for what felt like five minutes
__label__en	alberto came up to the loft
__label__en	alberto sat on the bed in silence
__label__en	isabella was looking at alberto in terror
__label__en	the cabin had a potbelly stove
__label__en	alberto heard the front door burst open
__label__en	alberto has never been that terrified
__label__en	alberto never heard any voices there
__label__en	alberto started to hear roosters in the distance
__label__en	the sounds finally stopped
__label__en	alberto packed everything up as quickly as possible
__label__en	alberto was trying to scare the campers away
__label__en	alberto booked an airbnb by himself
__label__en	alberto was so far from home
__label__en	the airbnb was much cheaper than any hotels in the area
__label__en	alberto brought his laptop with him
__label__en	alberto stayed for four days
__label__en	albertos interview was on a thursday
__label__en	alberto heard a tap on the window
__label__en	alberto swung to the left to look at the window
__label__en	alberto was kind of scared to look out the window
__label__en	a bug hit the window
__label__en	alberto explored different parts of the town in his car
__label__en	alberto was watching prison break on netflix
__label__en	alberto was even more disturbed
__label__en	alberto rushed to the window
__label__en	alberto opened the door and looked outside for a second
__label__en	alberto stepped outside onto the back porch
__label__en	alberto heard a click
__label__en	alberto clicked his tongue at the roof of his mouth
__label__en	alberto clicked in response
__label__en	alberto was standing not too far away
__label__en	alberto started walking a little closer then stopped
__label__en	alberto is on private property
__label__en	alberto saw isabella quickly walk away
__label__en	alberto was in his bed on his laptop watching netflix
__label__en	alberto didnt hear any noises in the house
__label__en	alberto turned the light off and tried to fall asleep
__label__en	the closet door was open just a crack
__label__en	alberto stared at the house as he talked to the 911 dispatcher
__label__en	alberto got a refund
__label__en	who else would have access to albertos house
__label__en	alberto snuck into isabellas apartment at an opportune time
__label__en	alberto had to stay at the office late almost every day that week
__label__en	alberto was finishing up on his work
__label__en	alberto told isabella he was heading out
__label__en	alberto heard the front door slam shut
__label__en	alberto had to keep himself awake
__label__en	alberto started to doze off
__label__en	alberto was waiting for the coffee to heat up
__label__en	alberto heard the sound of the door closing
__label__en	alberto left that door open
__label__en	albertos office was how he had left it
__label__en	alberto continued his work
__label__en	do you speak ligurian
__label__en	the lightning continued to strike about once every five minutes
__label__en	the screen went black
__label__en	alberto felt his heart drop into his stomach
__label__en	the door closed on its own
__label__en	the rain continued to hit the window
__label__en	the lightning startled alberto a few times
__label__en	alberto began closing down his computer
__label__en	alberto turned off the screen
__label__en	alberto didnt turn around
__label__en	alberto calmly grabbed his bag and left the office
__label__en	alberto ran down the flight of stairs to the fifth floor
__label__en	alberto got into his car and took a second to breathe
__label__en	alberto was looking down at isabella
__label__en	alberto asked isabella to check the office
__label__en	alberto was in the office but didnt see anyone
__label__en	albertos story freaked even isabella out
__label__en	alberto was walking around the office
__label__en	my child fly from everything that is evil and from everything that is like to it
__label__en	alberto did security work in an office building in bejaia algeria
__label__en	albertos view of that job changed entirely
__label__en	all the lights were out
__label__en	alberto went down there to investigate
__label__en	alberto took the stairs down there
__label__en	alberto was the only security guard on duty that day
__label__en	going down there alone was nervewrecking
__label__en	alberto was navigating the whole area in the dark with nothing but a flashlight
__label__en	my child flee from every evil man and from all like him
__label__en	many of the doors were bashed in
__label__en	the corridor leads to storage rooms
__label__en	the power generator was so badly damaged that it looked it was destroyed with an axe
__label__en	alberto was just a security guard
__label__en	the house had brokendown doors
__label__en	alberto heard a slam elsewhere in the basement
__label__en	alberto was in a deadsilent basement
__label__en	someone was in the basement
__label__en	the noises stopped
__label__en	alberto was scared shitless
__label__en	alberto turned off his flashlight
__label__en	the breathing stopped
__label__en	alberto saw a guy with an abnormally long face standing in the dark hallway
__label__en	alberto locked the door and called 911
__label__en	at least five police officers went down there
__label__en	alberto was in the lobby when the police officers came back
__label__en	the cops couldnt find alberto
__label__en	those doors certainly didnt smash themselves open
__label__en	alberto had his fist job ever in 2004
__label__en	only half the office was finished
__label__en	half the office was under renovation
__label__en	the office was unfinished
__label__en	wires were sticking out of sockets
__label__en	alberto turned off the lights completely on that side of the office
__label__en	alberto made a mad dash to the bathroom and from it

__label__en	alberto set up the xbox in the living room
__label__en	alberto wasnt much of a gamer
__label__en	alberto showed isabella how to play better
__label__en	alberto was standing so close

__label__en	alberto sat back down on the couch and continued to play
__label__en	alberto fell asleep with the tv on
__label__en	alberto heard a crunching noise in the hallway
__label__en	alberto heard a shuffling noise coming from the closet
__label__en	alberto sat up in his bed
__label__en	the door to the bathroom was half open
__label__en	i guess the teacher noticed by gasp
__label__en	alberto sat there frozen in fear as isabella came closer

__label__en	alberto pulled isabella out of the closet
__label__en	albertos response was unsettling
__label__en	alberto asked isabella who john was
__label__en	albertos heart skipped a bit as isabella said that
__label__en	alberto told isabella to stay in bed
__label__en	alberto went into the guest room and shut the door
__label__en	why would alberto say that
__label__en	alberto tried his best to clear his head
__label__en	alberto heard the sound of an object fall and hitting the door
__label__en	alberto heard isabella across the hall

__label__en	bruno was driving a blue pickup truck

__label__en	bruno knew isabella was staring at him
__label__en	bruno wasnt really reading
__label__en	bruno was reading the paper
__label__en	bruno looked up and gasped

__label__en	bruno has a mental disability
__label__en	bruno was looking up at the ceiling
__label__en	bruno only responded in loud noises
__label__en	there werent any cars in the parking lot
__label__en	bruno handed isabella a bag of chips
__label__en	bruno finally turned around and walked out of the store
__label__en	bruno felt a bit creeped out
__label__en	the phone on the counter rang
__label__en	bruno caught isabella off guard and she didnt know what to think
__label__en	bruno was becoming paranoid of his surroundings
__label__en	it wasnt brunos problem anymore
__label__en	bruno was ready to go to sleep
__label__en	why would someone be calling at five am
__label__en	bruno felt sick to his stomach as he listened to those weird noises
__label__en	bruno heard strange noises coming from all over his house

__label__en	bruno went into the basement for the first time in a while

__label__en	brunos german sheperd started going crazy as he approached the trunk of the car
__label__en	bruno heard the sound of a twig snapping
__label__en	im sorry for making you feel like youre not a significant part of my life
__label__en	bruno felt as if something would reach out and grab him
__label__en	bruno heard movement in all directions
__label__en	bruno stood still in the crops
__label__en	bruno couldnt fight
__label__en	bruno was choking isabella
__label__en	bruno was going to die
__label__en	bruno turned around pulled the trigger and killed isabella
__label__en	bruno didnt stop to see which way isabella went
__label__en	bruno still says that today

__label__en	a cop is sworn to protect
__label__en	she may be concerned about the appearance of her body and what you might think of her
__label__en	bruno got a job as a police officer
__label__en	bruno was expected to work the night shift

__label__en	bruno had a nightmaring story to tell
__label__en	there were absolutely no cars to be seen on the road at all
__label__en	all the stores at this hour were closed
__label__en	bruno was driving down a quiet road
__label__en	bruno drove slow
__label__en	bruno zoomed past a coffee shop
__label__en	bruno rolled down his window and stuck his head out
__label__en	the shop always closed at five pm on weekdays
__label__en	he told me that theyre now together
__label__en	bruno wondered why the lights were on
__label__en	bruno heard a sound coming from the basement
__label__en	bruno found the door that led downstairs to the dark basement
__label__en	bruno wasnt really afraid
__label__en	bruno walked down the concrete stairs
__label__en	bruno was at the bottom of the stairs
__label__en	bruno heard that sound again
__label__en	bruno just stood there waiting for the sound again
__label__en	the sound came from inside an air vent in the corner
__label__en	bruno put his ear up to the van and listened
__label__en	bruno heard something in there
__label__en	bruno heard the sound of someone breathing
__label__en	bruno tried to see into the van
__label__en	bruno unholstered his gun
__label__en	the sound was completely gone
__label__en	how did bruno get in there
__label__en	what was that strange noise
__label__en	the cops did a thorough investigation
__label__en	bruno was in the vents
__label__en	bruno used to work at a gas station in algiers
__label__en	bruno worked at a 24hour gas station
__label__en	there were still some people coming in
__label__en	bruno watched movies on his laptop
__label__en	bruno was watching that tv show
__label__en	the car turned into a gas station
__label__en	no one stepped out of the truck
__label__en	the car outside was still there
__label__en	brunos car was parked next to the pump
__label__en	bruno was counting money
__label__en	bruno heard a car door shut outside
__label__en	bruno asked isabella to come inside
__label__en	bruno was actually looking at isabella
__label__en	bruno opened the door and came inside
__label__en	bruno walked to the back section of the store
__label__en	bruno called out do you need help sir
__label__en	bruno slowly walked back outside not looking at isabella once
__label__en	bruno knew isabella was looking at him
__label__en	bruno began waving isabella over
__label__en	bruno started walking very quickly over to the door
__label__en	bruno looked like he was reaching for something
__label__en	bruno ran to the door so he could lock it
__label__en	bruno looked at isabella and she looked at him
__label__en	bruno shut the blinds to the windows
__label__en	bruno tried to put it out of his mind
__label__en	bruno knocked and knocked and knocked
__label__en	bruno stayed hidden in a corner behind the counter
__label__en	bruno saw isabellas truck was still there
__label__en	paranoid thoughts came to my head
__label__en	brunos car pulled into the parking lot
__label__en	bruno and isabella got into a long conversation about what just happened
__label__en	bruno was not laughing
__label__en	bruno was still shaking
__label__en	bruno was thinking about what happened
__label__en	bruno was delivering chinese food at a local chinese place
__label__en	it was a busy thursday night
__label__en	brunos boss was always a hard ass
__label__en	bruno made the delivery and came back quickly
__label__en	bruno gave isabella a better tip
__label__en	bruno stepped out of the car with a small brown bag of food
__label__en	bruno was peeking at isabella
__label__en	bruno was trying to hide
__label__en	brunos doorbell is broken
__label__en	bruno came inside and left the food on the table
__label__en	bruno looked up at the window again
__label__en	bruno wasnt at the window anymore
__label__en	bruno tried to rationalize
__label__en	bruno slowly turned the knob and the door was unlocked
__label__en	bruno could hear a fridge nearby
__label__en	bruno used his phone as a light
__label__en	bruno was in the corner of the kitchen
__label__en	bruno dropped the bag of food on the floor
__label__en	bruno did another delivery that night and went home
__label__en	bruno worked as an overnight security guard
__label__en	vandalism started to become a problem
__label__en	bruno was driving around the parking lot
__label__en	bruno approached the shop
__label__en	the shop was empty
__label__en	bruno headed back to his truck
__label__en	bruno approached the entrance to the mall
__label__en	the security gate was still closed
__label__en	bruno heard a click from behind him
__label__en	bruno saw someone run behind the counter and hide
__label__en	bruno was blaming those hallucinations just simply on the lack of sleep
__label__en	bruno shined his flashlight into the shop and scanned the area
__label__en	bruno saw someone standing there
__label__en	bruno stood next to the light switch
__label__en	there was no one standing there
__label__en	bruno was fairly close to the light switch
__label__en	bruno left the mall
__label__en	bruno was pretty spooked from the events of that night
__label__en	bruno was on security duty
__label__en	bruno was heading to a bathroom to relieve himself
__label__en	bruno heard a toilet flush
__label__en	bruno checked all the stalls in the bathroom
__label__en	bruno had a tapping sound coming from the stall next to him
__label__en	bruno was staring down at isabella
__label__en	the stall was empty
__label__en	brunos heart was thumping like crazy
__label__en	this happened at around five in the morning
__label__en	bruno was happy that he had the next day off
__label__en	bruno went to explore an abandoned mall
__label__en	bruno didnt have school the next day
__label__en	it was completely pitch black in there
__label__en	bruno explored the lower level of the mall
__label__en	bruno heard a banglike sound coming from the basement
__label__en	bruno heard another banglike sound
__label__en	bruno turned off his flashlight
__label__en	bruno started hearing muffled sounds in the dark
__label__en	bruno started feeling around for isabella
__label__en	bruno knew isabella was wearing a coat
__label__en	bruno was wearing a beanie and a face mask
__label__en	bruno tried dragging isabella
__label__en	bruno let go of isabella
__label__en	bruno ran to the same place he came in from
__label__en	bruno booked it out of the parking lot
__label__en	bruno gave isabella a firm handshake
__label__en	bruno thanked isabella for saving his life
__label__en	bruno used to work in a general store
__label__en	the mall closed at five pm
__label__en	the mall closed
__label__en	the night shift was uneventful most of the time
__label__en	the mall always had night lights on
__label__en	bruno was organizing the shelves
__label__en	bruno heard a rattle in the distance
__label__en	bruno asked isabella if there was a problem
__label__en	bruno was wearing a dirty blue shirt
__label__en	bruno asked isabella if something was wrong
__label__en	there was a protocol that bruno was supposed to follow
__label__en	bruno went back to his register behind the counter
__label__en	bruno was in direct sight for isabella
__label__en	bruno never backed away
__label__en	bruno was watching the cameras
__label__en	bruno resumed his cleaning activities
__label__en	thankfully bruno is gone now
__label__en	bruno continued with his work
__label__en	bruno went back to the register
__label__en	bruno went to the alcohol aisle
__label__en	bruno was looking at the top shelf
__label__en	bruno stood back up
__label__en	bruno was looking at isabella with a smile
__label__en	bruno stared at isabella and she stared at him
__label__en	brunos smile was a pure look of horror
__label__en	bruno felt like isabella stared into his soul
__label__en	bruno ran to the back room and locked the door
__label__en	bruno heard a tap at the door
__label__en	bruno heard a very gentle tap at the door
__label__en	bruno wanted to be anywhere but there
__label__en	bruno stepped back outside
__label__en	bruno is gone for good this time
__label__en	brunos shift ended
__label__en	bruno showed the boss the video footage
__label__en	bruno only worked there for another month after that
__label__en	we took a field trip to an aquarium
__label__en	bruno lives an area with nothing but woods and mountains as far as the eye can see
__label__en	the whole aquarium was empty
__label__en	bruno didnt see anyone else
__label__en	bruno moved on to the next room
__label__en	that room had a lot of big tanks with tropical fish
__label__en	bruno wore a blue tshirt
__label__en	bruno was about to shake his head no but isabella said yes
__label__en	bruno passed the bathrooms
__label__en	bruno reached an exit door
__label__en	bruno finally asked isabella if she worked there
__label__en	bruno got in serious trouble
__label__en	bruno told isabella to strap in
__label__en	bruno asked isabella what she was going
__label__en	if either of you tries to make any moves ill kill you
__label__en	bruno wanted to throw up
__label__en	bruno kept looking in the rear view mirror every other second
__label__en	bruno parked in what appeared to be the middle of nowhere
__label__en	bruno told isabella to step out
__label__en	bruno started walking isabella to the woods with a knife
__label__en	bruno seemed ready to run
__label__en	bruno ran downhill
__label__en	bruno threw the knife at isabella
__label__en	bruno heard the clinking of the knife hitting the ground behind him
__label__en	bruno managed to make it back to the aquarium
__label__en	bruno didnt even noticed
__label__en	bruno got himself in trouble
__label__en	bruno started to wonder more and more what isabellas intentions were
__label__en	bruno looked forward to that field trip
__label__en	the kids were taken to different attractions in algiers
__label__en	bruno took isabella to some of algerias historical sites
__label__en	the building was preseved due to its historical significance
__label__en	bruno carried around a camera
__label__en	bruno told isabella not to expect much from the tour
__label__en	bruno visited many colonial homes in algiers
__label__en	bruno was sharing a room with isabella during that trip
__label__en	bruno spent most of the time listening
__label__en	bruno was very curious about that home
__label__en	bruno adored his wife
__label__en	bruno and isabella are expecting a child
__label__en	bruno kept isabella in the house as much as he could
__label__en	he has a strange sense of humour
__label__en	bruno found isabella a suitor
__label__en	bruno learnt how to sew
__label__en	bruno lived in that house until his death
__label__en	bruno stopped and became silent
__label__en	bruno was staring out from the window
__label__en	bruno was standing behind isabella
__label__en	the third figure appeared to be a woman
__label__en	bruno lived with that family
__label__en	bruno and isabella had a black female servant living with them
__label__en	bruno took his students on a field trip to a museum
__label__en	i assure you theres nothing between us
__label__en	the building used to be a drug den
__label__en	the original purpose of the building wasnt known
__label__en	bruno wandered off to explore the museum on his own
__label__en	bruno returned to the bus
__label__en	bruno climbed the stairs too
__label__en	the wood was rotting
__label__en	bruno went up to the last floor
__label__en	there were no stairs to the last floor
__label__en	bruno watched his steps as he navigated the floor
__label__en	bruno heard a ticking noise
__label__en	bruno was making a ticking noise to call his cat
__label__en	bruno makes this ticking noise when he calls his cat
__label__en	all that was left of brunos body were a few stray fingers
__label__en	bruno kept making the ticking noise
__label__en	bruno pulled his arm out of the hole
__label__en	bruno nudged isabella to move
__label__en	bruno heard a crash far behind him
__label__en	bruno jumped through one of the holes
__label__en	bruno looked dangerous and unstable
__label__en	bruno looked up again
__label__en	bruno seemed much closer
__label__en	bruno looked up one more time
__label__en	bruno started to laugh
__label__en	bruno made it back safely
__label__en	bruno was genuinely disturbed
__label__en	bruno was pretty mad at isabella
__label__en	bruno advised we should leave the building
__label__en	that camping trip was the most horrific thing bruno had ever been through
__label__en	bruno is looking for treasure

__label__en	bruno decided to just bite the bullet and ask isabella out on a date
__label__en	we went inside easily but how will we find the exit

__label__en	bruno started to unload the truck
__label__en	bruno couldnt get the fire to catch

__label__en	bruno backed down the hill
__label__en	bruno was getting into the truck
__label__en	bruno heard a humming from the same spot
__label__en	bruno switched his lights off
__label__en	bruno was in the grass
__label__en	bruno heard the truck start
__label__en	bruno was looking through the glass into isabellas truck
__label__en	bruno may be sick in the head

__label__en	claudio got back down on his knees to look under the bed
__label__en	claudio took a look through the crack of the door
__label__en	claudio managed to run to the door and slam it shut
__label__en	there was someone in the bathroom
__label__en	no one was inside
__label__en	claudio called isabella before his shift ended
__label__en	claudio walked to the front door with his jacket on

__label__en	claudio dragged the spruice tree to his truck
__label__en	claudio threw isabella the keys
__label__en	claudio hurried to the truck
__label__en	claudio sat down on the trunk of the spruice tree
__label__en	claudio was standing by the freshly cut spruice tree
__label__en	the spruice tree was sitting on the ground
__label__en	claudio tried to sneak up on isabella
__label__en	claudio went to hide behind a big pine tree
__label__en	claudio was in a coat
__label__en	it was dark again
__label__en	claudio could barely see isabella
__label__en	claudio started sprinting down the hill back to the truck
__label__en	claudio started hearing screams
__label__en	claudio got to the bottom of the hill
__label__en	claudio heard the trucks horn honking
__label__en	claudio screamed at isabella to drive
__label__en	claudio was watching isabella drive away
__label__en	claudio stopped at a home depot and bought a christmas tree from there

__label__en	claudio isnt going down there alone
__label__en	claudio flipped all the lights
__label__en	claudios german shepherd is silent now
__label__en	claudios german shepherd looked at him
__label__en	claudios german shepherd was looking at a closet door
__label__en	claudio opened the closet door

__label__en	claudios german shepherd attacked the intruder
__label__en	claudio took his german shepherd by the collar
__label__en	claudio went to the kitchen to call his dad
__label__en	claudio picked up and said hello in a groggy voice
__label__en	claudio told isabella that he was scared
__label__en	claudio put the phone down for a second to listen
__label__en	claudio ran to his bathroom
__label__en	claudio hung up the phone
__label__en	claudio left a large amount of cash in the bedroom
__label__en	claudio happened to be home that night

__label__en	claudio was playing fifa with his friend
__label__en	claudio had headphones on
__label__en	claudio heard a noise come from behind him
__label__en	claudio had to get up
__label__en	claudio found that a bit unsettling
__label__en	claudio tried to continue playing
__label__en	claudio couldnt focus on the game anymore
__label__en	claudio took off the headphone
__label__en	claudio took off the headset
__label__en	claudio walked really slowly to the back side of the basement
__label__en	the closet was most likely the source of the sound
__label__en	claudio got a terrible painful feeling in his stomach as he approached the closet
__label__en	claudio was looking at the vents
__label__en	claudio started shaking the door aggressively
__label__en	claudio called the cops and told them to send someone right away
__label__en	claudio locked the door and hid
__label__en	the situation only became worse
__label__en	claudio was screaming things like where are you and ill kill you3
__label__en	claudio thought isabella was going to break the door down
__label__en	a police car pulled up in front of the house
__label__en	the cops went inside the apartment with their guns drawn
__label__en	the cops drove away
__label__en	claudio was giving isabella the most evil stare you would ever imagine
__label__en	claudio was living in his old house
__label__en	claudio has a pool table in the basement
__label__en	claudio heard things come from the boiler room
__label__en	claudio knew what that sound was
__label__en	the room was empty of any people
__label__en	nobody was in the laundry room
__label__en	claudio was walking to the kitchen
__label__en	claudio heard the tv downstairs turn on
__label__en	claudio called his brothers name but no one answer
__label__en	claudio was upset with isabella for waking him
__label__en	claudio was going to move to his new house
__label__en	claudio kept the tv downstairs
__label__en	claudio was once again playing video games
__label__en	claudio thought it was isabella at first
__label__en	claudio heard a ball bouncing downstairs
__label__en	claudio ran upstairs screaming
__label__en	claudio once again went downstairs
__label__en	claudio told isabella to wait there
__label__en	claudio was holding the door shut
__label__en	claudio was pulling the door shut
__label__en	claudio still doesnt know what to make of what was going on in that old and creepy house
__label__en	claudio is still living with his mom and dad
__label__en	quarantining started
__label__en	claudios room is in the basement
__label__en	claudio had an extra room in the house
__label__en	claudio is going to be moving out soon
__label__en	claudio knocked on the wall and it seemed to be hollow
__label__en	claudio used his iphone flashlight to navigate the dark basement
__label__en	claudio set up his xbox on the tv
__label__en	claudio was playing war zone on his xbox
__label__en	the noise came from claudios room
__label__en	claudio placed the vase on the table
__label__en	claudio woke to some weird muffled thuds
__label__en	claudio walked to the air vents
__label__en	a small animal was inside the vent
__label__en	claudio woke up at five in the morning feeling extremely thirsty
__label__en	claudio found a bottle
__label__en	claudio heard something from the basement
__label__en	claudio said that very quietly
__label__en	claudio finished his descent downstairs
__label__en	claudio went back to his room to hit the hay
__label__en	claudio looked at that little vent on the wall
__label__en	claudio saw a cockroach crawl out of the vent
__label__en	claudio moved away just as the light revealed him
__label__en	claudio screamed like a girl as he ran upstairs

__label__en	claudio lived on a basically deserted street
__label__en	the road seemed to lead to a deadend street

__label__en	claudios house was surrounded by nothing but woods
__label__en	a house came into sight
__label__en	nothing could be seen
__label__en	claudio wanted to get out of there as soon as possible
__label__en	claudio yelled out at isabella to turn around

__label__en	claudio looked at isabella as if he needed help
__label__en	claudio told isabella that he needed to use her phone

__label__en	startled claudio screamed oh my god
__label__en	claudio was more polite
__label__en	claudio just stared back at isabella with a crooked grin
__label__en	claudio was holding a thousanddinar bill
__label__en	claudio was staying in the room next door

__label__en	claudio ran out of the room screaming
__label__en	claudio wanted isabella to come into his room to meet his wife

__label__en	claudio cut the line
__label__en	claudio just has to get out
__label__en	claudio paid isabella for cleaning his room
__label__en	claudio was cleaning that room
__label__en	claudio was wasting too much time looking for his phone
__label__en	claudio could hear the cops shoes slamming onto the pavement after him
__label__en	claudio could no longer hear isabella searching for him

__label__en	tom keeps money and important documents in the safe
__label__en	claudio was driving a dark blue car
__label__en	claudio yelled for isabella to run but she was frozen in place

__label__en	claudio knows the city well
__label__en	claudio was heading away from home
__label__en	claudio was in tears
__label__en	claudio really didnt know what to do
__label__en	claudio got to the other side of the school
__label__en	claudio was out of breath
__label__en	claudio was speeding down the street like a mad man
__label__en	claudio turned down another street
__label__en	claudio started to cry out
__label__en	claudio was so close to the bush that isabella was hiding in
__label__en	claudio got back into his car and took off
__label__en	claudio ran for home
__label__en	claudio was driving down a oneway street
__label__en	claudio was wanted on five counts of murder
__label__en	this happend to claudio and his brother five months ago
__label__en	claudio and isabella are planning on going on a vacation
__label__en	claudio made it out of prison alive
__label__en	claudio really hopes nothing happens to isabella in prison
__label__en	claudio was a relatively large guy
__label__en	claudio weighs about the same as isabella
__label__en	claudio can handle himself extremely well when the situation calls for it
__label__en	claudio isnt violent by any means
__label__en	claudio decided to go to a local nightclub
__label__en	claudio had a few drinks
__label__en	claudio decided to sit down
__label__en	the dancing started to make claudio sweat
__label__en	claudio was sitting down
__label__en	claudio was eyeballing isabellas brother
__label__en	claudio needed some water
__label__en	claudio gave isabella a bottle of water
__label__en	claudio was still glaring at isabellas brother
__label__en	what the fuck are you staring at
__label__en	claudio was really large
__label__en	claudio walked towards the exit of the nightclub
__label__en	claudio pushed isabella outside the exit door
__label__en	claudio was much smaller than isabella was
__label__en	claudio escorted isabella to the exit
__label__en	claudio heard a loud thud
__label__en	claudio saw his brother lying face down on the concrete
__label__en	claudio started violently swinging the crawbar at isabella
__label__en	claudio hit on the back of his leg
__label__en	claudio attempted to strike isabella again
__label__en	claudio hit the floor
__label__en	claudios accomplice sprinted away
__label__en	claudio called for an ambulance
__label__en	shortly after the ambulance came the police arrived
__label__en	claudio was pronounced dead at the scene
__label__en	claudio was in shock but extremely grateful
__label__en	claudio was hit by that man

__label__en	claudio was a young boy in his teens
__label__en	claudio had this friend named walid
__label__en	have you ever been to his house
__label__en	thats how claudio got to know isabella

__label__en	claudio saw isabella at various parties
__label__en	claudio had long hair
__label__en	claudio was into smoking pot
__label__en	claudio had long hair and smoked pot
__label__en	claudio needed to take care of some business
__label__en	claudio excused himself to leave for something
__label__en	claudio lined up a joint
__label__en	claudio noticed isabella staring at him intensely
__label__en	claudio had that feeling once before
__label__en	claudio kept talking about going to a party
__label__en	claudio noticed isabella staring at him
__label__en	when claudio noticed isabella staring at him it gave him the creeps
__label__en	claudio was up in new york
__label__en	claudio assisted john in raping isabella
__label__en	claudio invited isabella over to a party
__label__en	claudio tortured john before killing him
__label__en	claudio finally put an end to that
__label__en	claudio dug up isabellas body
__label__en	claudio buried his victims in the woods
__label__en	claudios true victim count is much higher than twentfour
__label__en	claudio only watched the murders
__label__en	claudio is still serving time in jail
__label__en	claudio is still serving time in prison likely for the rest of his life
__label__en	claudio had strong instinct
__label__en	claudio was never targetted
__label__en	claudio was lucky as hell he was never invited to that party
__label__en	claudio was just a casual acquaintance
__label__en	claudio served in the vietnam war from 1960 to 1964
__label__en	claudio didnt mention those details
__label__en	claudio didnt like to tell that story
__label__en	those events were particularly traumatizing
__label__en	claudio was crawling through a deep tunnel
__label__en	the tunnel was empty and silent
__label__en	claudio heard a faint crying sound in the dark
__label__en	there was a woman screaming for help
__label__en	claudio continued to crawl through the tunnel
__label__en	there was a broken chair in the basement
__label__en	claudio continued deeper into the tunnel
__label__en	the stench of death became overwhelming
__label__en	the guys werent killed by just bullets
__label__en	claudio had to turn around and flee
__label__en	claudio crawled back out of the tunnel
__label__en	claudio and isabella looked at each other with wide eyes
__label__en	claudio picked up his pace even more
__label__en	claudio looked back every ten seconds
__label__en	the tunnel has been searched and cleared
__label__en	claudio logged plane parts
__label__en	claudio played games on his phone
__label__en	claudio was working on that plane
__label__en	claudio shot isabella a few texts
__label__en	the call rang five times then went to voice mail
__label__en	claudio waited and waited but isabella never showed up
__label__en	claudio sounded like a grown man in his forties
__label__en	claudio asked the man if he had seen anyone who might have resembled his brother
__label__en	claudio walked to his car which was parked in the parking lot
__label__en	claudio and isabella separated from each other
__label__en	claudio met john at a sketchy motel
__label__en	this is the closest town to the base
__label__en	what was claudio doing there that late
__label__en	claudio pulled into the little parking lot and parked
__label__en	the location of claudios phone was in the woods
__label__en	claudio looked around the whole parking lot and could find his car
__label__en	claudio called to isabella are you alone
__label__en	claudio inched his way closer to his truck
__label__en	claudio called his supervisor and told him that isabella was missing
__label__en	claudio was with isabella at that moment
__label__en	claudio tracked isabellas phone
__label__en	claudio asked for a ride back to the base
__label__en	claudio asked isabella to pull over by the woods
__label__en	claudio armed isabellas arm and squeezed it as she was trying to get out of the car
__label__en	claudio went back to the base to talk to his supervisor
__label__en	its possible claudio destroyed the phone
__label__en	claudio got isabella and her sister in the woods
__label__en	claudio married isabella during his days as a marine
__label__en	it was a pretty slow shift with not much going on
__label__en	claudio wasnt allowed to be on his phone
__label__en	claudio tried his best to follow that rule
__label__en	claudio began to hear a woman humming
__label__en	claudio started following the sound of the humming
__label__en	claudio walked along the long wall of trees
__label__en	claudio struggled to make it to the other side
__label__en	claudio walked closer to the grave
__label__en	claudio heard a buzzing sound coming from the shed
__label__en	the door didnt have any sort of lock on it
__label__en	the buzzing sound was coming from inside of the shed
__label__en	claudio lied flat on the floor
__label__en	claudio saw nothing at all
__label__en	claudio let out a bloodcurdling scream
__label__en	claudio has told isabella to meet him now
__label__en	claudio looked through the hole but saw nothing
__label__en	claudio knew the boss didnt believe him
__label__en	claudio witnessed something completely supernatural
__label__en	claudio doesnt know the woman that he saw could have been
__label__en	claudio was buried in the el alia cemetery in algiers
__label__en	claudio bought weed on the deep web
__label__en	claudio doesnt condone doing anything like this
__label__en	claudio continued browsing tatoeba
__label__en	claudio joined a drug chatroom
__label__en	claudio found tatoeba interesting
__label__en	the link brought claudio on a blank page
__label__en	claudios chatroom didnt have a title
__label__en	claudio and isabella were talking in another language
__label__en	claudio typed yo and isabella typed yo back
__label__en	claudio typed yo directed at isabella
__label__en	it took a little while to load the page
__label__en	the video was black and white
__label__en	claudio was watching a live video
__label__en	claudio suddenly jumped up and sprinted towards the camera
__label__en	all claudio could see was black
__label__en	claudio couldnt type anything
__label__en	claudio tried to disguise his voice
__label__en	claudio has all your files
__label__en	claudio was able to get the basic info off isabellas computer
__label__en	claudio was visiting a safe website
__label__en	you dont have to answer the question
__label__en	claudio is from a small town called sidi aich in algeria
__label__en	claudio was out to get isabella
__label__en	claudio is an active poster on that page

__label__en	claudio wrote a paragraph full of his personal information
__label__en	claudios heart was in his throat
__label__en	claudio covered his webcam with a piece of tape
__label__en	claudio went to report the account on reddit
__label__en	claudio got an email five minutes later
__label__en	claudio will never hear from isabella again
__label__en	claudio didnt have that amount of money
__label__en	claudio threatened to call the police
__label__en	claudio might have issues with isabella
__label__en	claudio paid the money
__label__en	claudio left his laptop off the whole next day
__label__en	claudio didnt sign into reddit
__label__en	claudio was so bored
__label__en	claudio got new emails
__label__en	everything still looked normal
__label__en	the meeting was held behind closed doors
__label__en	claudio talked about computer hackers
__label__en	the bottom of the screen turned darker

__label__en	claudio was in the picture
__label__en	claudio was laying in his bed sleeping
__label__en	claudio called his parents
__label__en	some hacker has claudios pictures and is threatening to publish them on social media
__label__en	claudio was embarrassed by it
__label__en	claudio blocked that email address
__label__en	claudio finally got back to his apartment
__label__en	claudio hasnt reported that to the police
__label__en	isabella has had her share of experiences with stalkers
__label__en	claudio clicked the link and her computer started to get all glitchy and unresponsive
__label__en	claudio asked isabella if she was the one who posted that on instagram
__label__en	claudios pictures were extremely embarrassing
__label__en	claudio asked isabella to snapchatcall him
__label__en	isabella is claudios digital girlfriend
__label__en	claudio set his instagram profile to private
__label__en	claudio said that with a smile
__label__en	claudio refused to show the rest of the picture
__label__en	claudio told all his friends about it
__label__en	claudio activated the twofactor veritication feature on his facebook
__label__en	blocking claudio on facebook was a stupid thing to do
__label__en	claudio got a snap from isabella
__label__en	dont block me again
__label__en	claudio ran outside in a fit of rage
__label__en	claudio did absolutely nothing
__label__en	cops seemed clueless on the matter
__label__en	if you fuck with me again youll be arrested
__label__en	claudio got a computer virus
__label__en	claudio clicked on the link and a new browser opened
__label__en	claudio closed the page
__label__en	claudio deleted the email
__label__en	claudios computer was working much slower
__label__en	claudio froze for a few seconds
__label__en	claudio tried restarting his computer
__label__en	claudio used his dads computer in the basement to do his homework

__label__en	claudio saved all his important files on a flashdrive
__label__en	the program started installing
__label__en	claudio wanted to install the game on his laptop
__label__en	claudio deleted the file
__label__en	claudio restarted his computer
__label__en	claudios computer started acting up
__label__en	claudio didnt do anything to fix the issue
__label__en	claudio turned the computer off for a couple hours
__label__en	claudio returned to his room to prepare for bed
__label__en	claudios desktop wallpaper was changed
__label__en	claudio turned the computer off by holding the power button for a few seconds
__label__en	it was still completely pitch black outside
__label__en	claudio heard a loud aggressive bang on his window
__label__en	claudio gathered the courage to get up and check
__label__en	claudio set the picture as his desktop wallpaper
__label__en	claudio went under his bed to grab his gun
__label__en	the picture on the window was gone
__label__en	claudio got a virus from trying to download that game
__label__en	claudio became the target of some serious hacker
__label__en	claudio scared off isabellas stalker
__label__en	claudio was able to sleep after that
__label__en	claudio is currently fortyfour years old
__label__en	claudio was doing really poorly in one of his coding classes
__label__en	claudio wanted to learn c

__label__en	claudio decompressed the folder and viewed the contents
__label__en	claudio tried to decompress the folder
__label__en	the folder was passwordprotected
__label__en	claudio checked the folder
__label__en	claudios computer made a weird noise
__label__en	claudio tried running the program at least five more times
__label__en	toms contributions are getting uncomfortably confessional
__label__en	claudio nearly shat himself
__label__en	claudio was dazed and confused
__label__en	the screaming sound seemed to be coming from claudios laptop
__label__en	claudio always kept his laptop closed at night
__label__en	claudio felt scared approaching his computer to turn it off
__label__en	claudio couldnt move the cursor
__label__en	claudio held the power button on his laptop until it turned off

__label__en	claudio changed out of his work clothes into his running clothes
__label__en	claudio did five minutes of walking
__label__en	claudios german shepherd is always a joy to walk
__label__en	claudios german shepherd stopped in her tracks
__label__en	claudios german shepherd was looking behind us
__label__en	claudio tried to pull his german shepherd forward to continue their walk
__label__en	claudio was looking at isabella and her german shepherd
__label__en	claudios german shepherd finally budged and started walking by his side again
__label__en	claudio looked down at his german shepherd
__label__en	claudios german shepherd stopped him again
__label__en	claudio was walking slowly towards isabella and her german shepherd
__label__en	the closer claudio got the slower he walked
__label__en	claudio maintained eye contact with isabella
__label__en	claudio continued approaching isabella
__label__en	claudios german shepherd started barking in the other direction
__label__en	claudio knew something bad was about to go down
__label__en	claudio started fullon charging isabella
__label__en	claudios german shepherd bit isabella on the leg
__label__en	claudio tackled that man to the ground

__label__en	claudio woke up again
__label__en	claudios german shepherd was in the center of the room

__label__en	flavio moved to a nice neighborhood
__label__en	flavio is our nextdoor neighbor to the west
__label__en	flavio knew that somebody lived there
__label__en	there was always a car in the driveway
__label__en	flavio was standing at one of the front windows
__label__en	flavio was really awkward
__label__en	flavio had to look again
__label__en	flavio smiled and waved at isabella
__label__en	flavio kept staring at isabella
__label__en	flavio walked all the way to his house
__label__en	this is the first time that flavio has seen isabella
__label__en	flavio disliked isabella for some reason
__label__en	flavio played loud music at night
__label__en	flavio is unfriendly
__label__en	flavio saw isabella again
__label__en	flavio was getting home
__label__en	it was dark out
__label__en	flavio saw isabella as he got out of his car
__label__en	flavio seemed strange to isabella
__label__en	flavio went to bed an hour later
__label__en	flavio was on his way there
__label__en	flavio got to the kitchen
__label__en	flavio wondered what on earth isabella was doing
__label__en	flavio went to see if his neighbor was still there
__label__en	flavio didnt see his neighbor at all anymore
__label__en	flavio went over to talk to his neighbor
__label__en	flavio knocked on his neighbors door
__label__en	flavio looked into isabellas window
__label__en	flavio didnt shake isabellas hand and asked her what she wanted
__label__en	flavio cursed at isabella and slammed the door in her face
__label__en	flavio doesnt miss isabella at all
__label__en	flavio was staring into isabellas windows
__label__en	flavio used to live in an old apartment
__label__en	flavio saw isabella around the building
__label__en	flavio was staying up late watching a movie
__label__en	flavio was eating popcorn
__label__en	flavio paused the movie and listened close
__label__en	flavio expected somebody to knock
__label__en	flavio saw a guy standing right outside the door
__label__en	the door moved a little bit
__label__en	flavio was one of isabellas neighbors
__label__en	flavio lived on isabellas floor
__label__en	flavio lived five doors down
__label__en	flavio was finally able to go to sleep
__label__en	flavio tried opening the door again
__label__en	flavio just turned around and walked away
__label__en	flavio had no idea what isabella was doing
__label__en	flavio and isabella crossed paths down the hallway
__label__en	flavio said hi to isabella
__label__en	flavio didnt know if he woke isabella up or not
__label__en	flavio and isabella went their separate ways
__label__en	flavio felt relieved
__label__en	flavio didnt really seem drunk
__label__en	flavio was trying to break in
__label__en	flavio tried to get in again
__label__en	flavio was still drunk
__label__en	flavio wasnt telling isabella the truth
__label__en	flavio was in his bedroom on his phone
__label__en	flavio walked over to the door and looked outside
__label__en	flavio looked out the peephole
__label__en	flavios place was old
__label__en	the door moved slightly
__label__en	flavio couldnt be seen
__label__en	flavio hid around the corner
__label__en	flavio didnt like that at all
__label__en	flavio kept still and did not move
__label__en	flavio finally left
__label__en	flavio didnt know what isabella wanted
__label__en	flavio moved out of that apartment
__label__en	flavio was glad that he moved out of that apartment
__label__en	flavio doesnt live there anymore
__label__en	flavio lived in a pretty nice area
__label__en	flavio enjoyed that area
__label__en	flavio heard a noise coming from the other side of the house
__label__en	flavio was walking over to the dining room
__label__en	flavio briefly heard footsteps in his house
__label__en	flavio was walking away
__label__en	flavio went to his back door and locked it
__label__en	flavio was long gone by then
__label__en	flavio gave the cops all the information that he could
__label__en	flavio gave the cops enough information
__label__en	flavio was outside doing some yard work
__label__en	flavio was walking in isabellas direction
__label__en	flavio was focused on what he was doing
__label__en	flavio turned around and saw isabella
__label__en	flavio has just moved in here
__label__en	flavio and isabella talked for maybe a minute
__label__en	flavio acted normal
__label__en	flavio went back to the police after that
__label__en	flavio denied he lived on that street
__label__en	flavio installed security cameras
__label__en	flavio still wondered why isabella was trying to break into his house
__label__en	this happened many years ago when flavio was a kid
__label__en	flavio used that desktop computer all the time
__label__en	there were games that flavio could play
__label__en	flavio doesnt remember much about isabella
__label__en	flavio was chatting with random strangers on the internet
__label__en	on the internet flavio was a bit of a troll
__label__en	flavio started to make random jokes
__label__en	flavio doesnt remember isabellas username
__label__en	flavio could find out who that guy was
__label__en	flavio responded with something dumb
__label__en	flavio was planning on leaving
__label__en	flavio used the internet to find out information about isabella
__label__en	flavio sent isabella a link and told her to look at it
__label__en	flavio created his facebook profile five months ago
__label__en	flavio really doesnt remember
__label__en	flavio was both amazed and scared by that
__label__en	flavio went back onto the computer
__label__en	flavio wasnt that interested in that
__label__en	flavio had a friend request from somebody that he didnt recognize
__label__en	flavio took a break from facebook
__label__en	flavio was on the computer again
__label__en	flavio was playing some game on the computer
__label__en	flavio was in his office
__label__en	flavios mom was not home
__label__en	flavio asked for isabellas name
__label__en	flavio was completely freaked out
__label__en	flavio went to his parents and told them everything
__label__en	flavio banned isabella from the internet for a week
__label__en	flavio was probably a hacker
__label__en	flavio never used that website
__label__en	flavio heard about tinder but never used it
__label__en	flavio is watching random youtube videos
__label__en	can you walk a little slower
__label__en	flavio briefly spoke with isabella
__label__en	flavio looked to be about isabellas age
__label__en	flavio was talking to a girl who looked to be about his age
__label__en	how do you verify your bank account
__label__en	in the picture flavio appeared to be in a bedroom
__label__en	flavio appeared in the window
__label__en	flavio was sitting in a chair looking at his phone
__label__en	flavio wanted to see what would happen
__label__en	flavio was looking at isabellas window
__label__en	when isabella saw flavio she screamed
__label__en	we have been disconnected
__label__en	flavio seemed genuinely freaked out
__label__en	there is no way to know
__label__en	flavio freaked out and closed his laptop
__label__en	flavio stayed there at the window
__label__en	flavio attempted to open the window
__label__en	flavio left before the police got there
__label__en	flavio texted all the details to isabella
__label__en	flavio attempted to break into isabellas apartment
__label__en	this happened almost five years ago now
__label__en	flavio joined an online videochat room
__label__en	flavio was just playing funny
__label__en	flavio had to leave
__label__en	flavio was too boring
__label__en	flavio was too weird
__label__en	flavio looked to be a little bit older than isabella
__label__en	flavio spoke back to isabella
__label__en	flavio was from algeria as well
__label__en	flavio claimed that he lived in algiers too
__label__en	flavio wasnt making that up
__label__en	flavio lifted up the blinds
__label__en	i got it as a gift
__label__en	flavio lived really closeby
__label__en	flavio asked if he could come over
__label__en	flavio was going to come over
__label__en	flavio came across as really creepy
__label__en	flavio talked very shortly with isabella
__label__en	flavio decided to watch a show until he was tired
__label__en	flavios blinds were closed
__label__en	flavio pulled back the blinds
__label__en	flavio was looking right at isabella
__label__en	flavio knocked another time on the window
__label__en	flavio yelled that he was calling the police
__label__en	things went silent again
__label__en	flavio went back to watching the show that he had been
__label__en	flavio wasnt asleep for very long
__label__en	flavio heard more knocks on the window
__label__en	flavio was repeatedly knocking on the window
__label__en	flavio was looking right at isabella again
__label__en	flavio went into isabellas bedroom to see what was going on
__label__en	flavio ran away into the street
__label__en	flavio told isabella the entire story from the beginning
__label__en	flavio lived in a house with a couple of other people
__label__en	flavio lived much farther away
__label__en	the long school year was finally over in may
__label__en	flavio stayed in the apartment until the lease was up
__label__en	flavio had some of his things packed up
__label__en	flavio was still using the kitchen and the bathroom
__label__en	flavio was going to sweep the floor
__label__en	flavio opened the door to the closet and saw a man standing inside
__label__en	flavio wasnt thinking of anything
__label__en	flavio ran into his bedroom and closed the door
__label__en	flavio was in his messy bedroom
__label__en	flavio was pacing back and forth in his room
__label__en	the footsteps reached the top of the staircase
__label__en	flavio ran out of the room as fast as he could
__label__en	flavio emerged from the front door of the house and started to run after isabella
__label__en	flavio got back there
__label__en	flavio searched everywhere inside
__label__en	flavio had no idea how isabella had gotten inside
__label__en	flavio left the next morning for home
__label__en	flavio lives alone in a small town in algeria
__label__en	flavio was pretty busy with work
__label__en	flavio never checks his mail
__label__en	all flavio got was junk mail
__label__en	flavio never checks his physical mail
__label__en	things were a little less busy at work
__label__en	flavio threw away ninety percent of the mail
__label__en	flavio was sorting through the mail
__label__en	the letter had flavios name on it
__label__en	there was no return address on the letters
__label__en	flavio received a handwritten letter
__label__en	flavios letters were all pretty short
__label__en	flavio never responded to those letters
__label__en	flavio was frustrated with isabella ignoring him
__label__en	flavio was losing patience
__label__en	the envelopes were the same lightblue color
__label__en	flavio was pretty lazy
__label__en	flavio lives in a complex
__label__en	flavio has received five letters already
__label__en	flavio was manually placing the letters in isabellas mailbox
__label__en	flavio pulled his car into the driveway
__label__en	flavio kept watching the man
__label__en	flavio kept walking until he was out of sight
__label__en	flavio lived in the neighborhood
__label__en	flavio found a new letter
__label__en	flavio opened up the letter and read it
__label__en	flavio told the cops everything that was going on
__label__en	who was leaving those letters
__label__en	flavio heard a loud and constant banging on his front door
__label__en	flavio told isabella to go away
__label__en	flavio kept pounding on isabellas door loudly
__label__en	i wont live until you let me inside
__label__en	flavio seemed insane to isabella
__label__en	flavio was doing some cleaning in his apartment
__label__en	flavio plays video games in the basement
__label__en	flavio vacuumed the basement
__label__en	flavio was vacuuming in the couch area
__label__en	flavio found food wrappers behind the couch
__label__en	flavio hasnt been home in several weeks
__label__en	flavio seemed a little bit strange
__label__en	flavio walked over to the door and saw it was unlocked
__label__en	flavio locked the sliding door
__label__en	flavio was in the basement
__label__en	flavio must have left the door unlocked
__label__en	isabella told her husband about it
__label__en	flavio was down there
__label__en	flavio did not come upstairs where we were
__label__en	flavio didnt steal anything
__label__en	the door has been unlocked again
__label__en	the lock was completely broken and not working
__label__en	flavio got the lock fixed
__label__en	flavio didnt see anything else
__label__en	this is something that took place back when flavio was in high school
__label__en	who wants seconds
__label__en	flavio rode the bus home from school
__label__en	flavio was back by about five thiry pm
__label__en	flavio wasnt home from work yet
__label__en	flavio left work early
__label__en	flavio will be home alone for five hours
__label__en	flavio had some homework to do that day
__label__en	flavio ran upstairs to his bedroom to do his homework
__label__en	flavio was doing homework when he heard a knock on the front door
__label__en	flavio expected isabella to be gone
__label__en	flavio arrived at the front door
__label__en	flavio was wearing a business uniform
__label__en	flavio was carrying a briefcase
__label__en	flavio went back upstairs to his room
__label__en	flavio continued doing his homework
__label__en	flavio walked closer to the window
__label__en	flavio ducked down below his window
__label__en	flavio was still at the window
__label__en	flavio looked inside the window
__label__en	flavio walked over to another window and looked out
__label__en	flavio wasnt home yet
__label__en	flavio went out of his bedroom
__label__en	flavio pressed the button to open the garage door
__label__en	we teach each other
__label__en	flavio saw the intruder scrambling away
__label__en	flavios parents have gotten home
__label__en	flavio lost sight of isabella
__label__en	flavio was impressed with how isabella handled the situation
__label__en	flavio wasnt able to get into the house
__label__en	flavio wasnt able to break into the apartment
__label__en	flavio lived in a small onebedroom place
__label__en	flavio was cooking dinner
__label__en	flavio was at the stove in the kitchen
__label__en	it started to get really hot
__label__en	flavio cooks every day
__label__en	flavio cooks often
__label__en	flavio was still in the kitchen cooking
__label__en	flavio looked over and saw isabella standing at the door
__label__en	flavio was too confused to say or do anything
__label__en	flavio walked right inside the room
__label__en	flavio yelled again louder than the first time
__label__en	flavio was standing in the kitchen
__label__en	flavios bedroom door started to open
__label__en	flavio did not have his cellphone with him
__label__en	whats the shift key for
__label__en	flavio left his phone on the kitchen counter
__label__en	flavio didnt want to go back in there
__label__en	flavio didnt know where the police station was
__label__en	flavio didnt have his phone on him
__label__en	flavio is probably gone by now
__label__en	flavios whole place was all messed up
__label__en	flavio didnt see or hear anybody
__label__en	flavios door is now closed
__label__en	flavio has never met his new neighbors
__label__en	flavio let isabella inside his apartment
__label__en	flavio waited for the police to show up
__label__en	flavio was just glad isabella was gone
__label__en	flavio was going on a weekend trip with some of his friends
__label__en	flavio didnt really have any plans
__label__en	flavio was the only one in the house
__label__en	flavio stayed up pretty late
__label__en	flavio turned off all the lights and went into his bed
__label__en	the noise was quiet
__label__en	take it see if i care
__label__en	flavio thought that he was just being paranoid
__label__en	flavio was just worried for no reason
__label__en	flavio heard the knocking once more
__label__en	the knocking was louder
__label__en	flavios window was next to a tree
__label__en	flavio got up and turned on his bedroom light
__label__en	flavio noticed a car in the driveway
__label__en	flavios truck was parked in front of isabellas house
__label__en	flavio heard a sound coming from the back side of the house
__label__en	flavio ran back into his bedroom
__label__en	flavio covered himself with his blankets
__label__en	flavio tried his best to just hide
__label__en	flavio didnt hear any loud noises
__label__en	what flavio told isabella gave her the chills
__label__en	flavio was able to get inside
__label__en	flavio ran away when the cops got there
__label__en	flavio felt much better after that
__label__en	did you get up on the wrong side of the bed
__label__en	flavio and isabella are both studying in the same city
__label__en	flavio was studying for his exams
__label__en	flavio realized there was no food in the fridge
__label__en	flavio went to a wellsupplied supermarket in algiers
__label__en	flavio and isabella acted like they knew each other
__label__en	flavio is a very polite and tolerant person
__label__en	flavio was a short overweight guy with a goatie
__label__en	flavios fingers were twitching as he spoke
__label__en	flavio realized that something was weird with that guy
__label__en	flavio was just standing there speechless
__label__en	flavio kept insisting that isabella go with him
__label__en	flavio called isabella by her real name
__label__en	flavio found out isabellas real name
__label__en	flavio didnt seem like a university student at all
__label__en	flavio was just a construction worker
__label__en	isabella wasnt in the least interested in that creep
__label__en	flavio stood in the same spot for a moment
__label__en	flavio started following isabella
__label__en	flavio got even more scared
__label__en	flavio got to his apartment complex safely
__label__en	flavio arrived back safely before dark
__label__en	flavio knew where isabellas apartment was
__label__en	flavio didnt remember isabellas facial features
__label__en	flavio just cant take no for an answer
__label__en	flavio is one of those narcissistic people who just cant take no for an answer
__label__en	flavio needed a few things
__label__en	flavio was planning on cooking something fancy for dinner
__label__en	the parking lot had many cars in it
__label__en	flavio has just gotten off from work
__label__en	flavio paid for everything
__label__en	flavio walked back to his truck
__label__en	flavio stopped at a gas station
__label__en	flavios gas talk was at about one fourth
__label__en	flavio checked in all of his bags
__label__en	flavio left the bag at the grocery store
__label__en	then grocery store was quite busy
__label__en	flavio saw isabella drop her wallet
__label__en	flavio continued on with his drive home
__label__en	flavio was two minutes away from home
__label__en	flavio was disappointed to hear that
__label__en	flavio arrived at his apartment
__label__en	flavio arrived at his house
__label__en	all the cash that was inside of the wallet was gone
__label__en	flavio canceled his credit card
__label__en	flavio was happy to have his wallet back
__label__en	flavios drivers license had his old address on it
__label__en	flavio somehow knew isabella and where she lived
__label__en	flavio works at a grocery store
__label__en	flavio needs to focus on school
__label__en	flavio has been working there for probably five weeks
__label__en	flavio came across to isabella as a total creep
__label__en	flavio was short and pretty skinny
__label__en	flavio was standing at the end of the aisle staring at isabella but she ignored him
__label__en	flavio seemed to be staring at isabella
__label__en	flavio seemed a little bit off
__label__en	flavio doesnt get along with that coworker
__label__en	flavio spent maybe fifty minutes in that one aisle
__label__en	flavio only glanced at isabella for a moment
__label__en	how long has been flavio watching isabella and why
__label__en	flavio was done with his task
__label__en	flavio did not look at isabella or in her direction
__label__en	flavio mumbled hi back
__label__en	flavio didnt see friendly at all
__label__en	flavio was annoyed that isabella was talking to him
__label__en	flavio wasnt interested in interacting with isabella again
__label__en	flavio heard some footsteps outside the door
__label__en	flavio thought nothing of it
__label__en	flavio tried to open the door several times but he couldnt do it
__label__en	flavio looked around and didnt see anybody else in the store
__label__en	flavio just denied it and walked away
__label__en	flavio just got back to work again
__label__en	flavio only had about an hour left of work
__label__en	flavio was pretty far back
__label__en	flavio was getting on isabellas nerves
__label__en	flavio was closer
__label__en	flavio was trying to creep up on isabella

__label__en	lorenzo told melissa stories about the deaths that happened in that house
__label__en	lorenzo was probably making it up
__label__en	kids were embellishing all the rumors
__label__en	it was lorenzos turn to hide
__label__en	lorenzo climbed the stairs looking for a good hiding spot
__label__en	lorenzo came to a small room with a closet
__label__en	lorenzo stepped inside the closet
__label__en	lorenzo crouched down and waited
__label__en	there was still no sign of the seekers
__label__en	lorenzo hid there for fifteen minutes and there was still no sigh of his seekers
__label__en	what has lorenzo been doing in the shed
__label__en	lorenzo is abandoned here in algiers
__label__en	lorenzo heard a door slamming shut downstairs
__label__en	lorenzo is one of lorenzos cousins
__label__en	lorenzo heard footsteps and a thud
__label__en	lorenzos footsteps were slow and heavy
__label__en	the footsteps continued to ascend
__label__en	the walking resumed
__label__en	after another moment of silence the footsteps resumed
__label__en	lorenzo wandered aimlessly in the garden
__label__en	the footsteps reached lorenzos door
__label__en	the footsteps continued on to the bathroom
__label__en	there were no more sounds
__label__en	lorenzo heard raspy breathing behind him
__label__en	lorenzo navigated through the dark house
__label__en	lorenzo never looked back
__label__en	lorenzo saw absolutely nothing
__label__en	nobody was chasing lorenzo
__label__en	lorenzo ran all the way back to his aunts house

__label__en	the police scoured every building in town
__label__en	lorenzo spent hours searching for melissa
__label__en	lorenzo was hinding in an abandoned house
__label__en	lorenzo was smiling and waving down at melissa
__label__en	lorenzo slept in the closet
__label__en	lorenzo over at his friends house
__label__en	lorenzo was in the same grade as melissa
__label__en	lorenzo is also fourteen
__label__en	lorenzo is only fourteen years old
__label__en	lorenzo anbd melissa were the only kids on the entire block
__label__en	lorenzo and walid were close friends
__label__en	lorenzo and his friends played a great game of manhunt
__label__en	there wasnt a lot going on in our area
__label__en	lorenzo hid first
__label__en	lorenzo had melissa on his team
__label__en	lorenzo was an old man who passed away a few years ago
__label__en	lorenzo went to the back section of the property
__label__en	lorenzo wanted to try someting crazy
__label__en	lorenzo waited alone in the bushes
__label__en	lorenzo was in those bushes for like fifteen minutes
__label__en	lorenzo was making a lot of noise making his presence known
__label__en	lorenzo was standing near one of the windows
__label__en	lorenzo was relieved to see melissa
__label__en	lorenzo let melissa know that it was time to go
__label__en	lorenzo felt like his heart stopped when he saw melissa in the hallway
__label__en	lorenzo heard a noise coming from upstairs
__label__en	lorenzo has moved into the home
__label__en	nobody has lived there for five years
__label__en	lorenzo flicked on the light and saw melissa
__label__en	lorenzo went through the entire house and found nothing
__label__en	lorenzo hasnt seen anything strange since
__label__en	lorenzo had nothing to do for the night
__label__en	lorenzo was going to some huge party upstate
__label__en	lorenzo drank and went crazy
__label__en	lorenzo had no plans
__label__en	lorenzo was a shy kid
__label__en	lorenzo helped melissa to break out of her shell
__label__en	lorenzo had to stay in a motel
__label__en	lorenzo was honking his horn outside
__label__en	the sky turned bright orange as the sun was setting
__label__en	lorenzo rolled down the window and called melissas name
__label__en	here were beer bottles scattered everywhere
__label__en	lorenzo was holding a beer bottle
__label__en	lorenzo parked the car in the grass
__label__en	parking is free for all
__label__en	lorenzo found some other friends on the beach
__label__en	lorenzo handed melissa a beer which he nervously accepted
__label__en	lorenzo asked melissa how old she was
__label__en	lorenzo felt alone and awkward
__label__en	at the party lorenzo felt alone and awkward
__label__en	lorenzo had a beer in his hand
__label__en	lorenzo was like in his forties or fifties
__label__en	lorenzo took the beer out of melissas hand
__label__en	lorenzo choked up for words
__label__en	lorenzo put the beer on a nearby table
__label__en	lorenzo asked melissa who she was there with
__label__en	lorenzo talked his way away from that guy
__label__en	lorenzo felt so alone and awkward
__label__en	lorenzo sat on a log reflecting on himself
__label__en	lorenzo heard a huge boom and a roar of cheering
__label__en	fireworks were blowing up in the sky
__label__en	lorenzo tried to scream and break free
__label__en	lorenzo felt like he was becoming lightheaded
__label__en	lorenzo grabbed a big stone from in front of him and struck that guy in the face
__label__en	lorenzo let loose his grip
__label__en	lorenzo got up and ran
__label__en	lorenzo and walid were wearing the same thing
__label__en	lorenzo was the host of the party
__label__en	lorenzo asked melissa if she knew the man
__label__en	lorenzo was too drunk to drive
__label__en	lorenzo ended up driving to the motel
__label__en	lorenzo didnt tell anyone about the incident out of embarrassment
__label__en	lorenzo regrets that now
__label__en	lorenzo lives in a calm suburban neighborhood
__label__en	lorenzo was covering someones shift
__label__en	lorenzo was having his kind of fun in the basement
__label__en	lorenzo was playing his favorite game
__label__en	lorenzo was talking with some friends
__label__en	lorenzos broken dishwasher sounded very loud
__label__en	lorenzo increased the volume on his headset
__label__en	lorenzo has a broken dishwasher
__label__en	lorenzo got back to his game
__label__en	the volume was on 94
__label__en	lorenzo reduced the volume
__label__en	the sound wasnt from the dryer
__label__en	lorenzo came to look what was making that noise
__label__en	lorenzo has never gone in there
__label__en	lorenzo didnt want to go down there
__label__en	lorenzo went to the basement door and listened
__label__en	the sound went on for a good five minutes before silence
__label__en	the sound started again
__label__en	lorenzo had no weapons to defend himself
__label__en	the sound was very loud
__label__en	lorenzo took his phone and dialed his wifes number
__label__en	lorenzo will be over as soon as he can
__label__en	somebody was in lorenzos apartment
__label__en	fireworks were booming in the distance
__label__en	there is an intruder in lorenzos house
__label__en	lorenzo heard footsteps coming upstairs
__label__en	lorenzo was crawling as far away as he could from the window
__label__en	lorenzo couldnt even see melissa
__label__en	lorenzo looked away from the window and saw melissa crying
__label__en	lorenzo was in cuffs
__label__en	lorenzo gave melissa an evil hateful stare before being taken away to the police car
__label__en	lorenzo lives in a very quiet town in algeria
__label__en	lorenzo decided to come over to melissas house
__label__en	lorenzo doesnt have closeby neighbors
__label__en	lorenzo brought some firecrackers
__label__en	lorenzo finished his fourth beer
__label__en	lorenzo lit up the firecrackers
__label__en	lorenzo noticed his garage was open
__label__en	lorenzo walked over to the garage
__label__en	lorenzo went inside the garage and turned on the light
__label__en	lorenzo broke into melissas garage and possibly robbed her
__label__en	lorenzo doesnt know what the robber took
__label__en	lorenzo momentarily left the party to check his apartment
__label__en	lorenzo just sat there outside on the porch
__label__en	lorenzo couldnt wait anymore
__label__en	the fireworks lit up the whole neighborhood and lorenzo loved it
__label__en	the fuse was burning
__label__en	lorenzo and melissa both looked in that direction
__label__en	lorenzo saw a figure in the woods facing him
__label__en	lorenzo chased melissa into the woods
__label__en	lorenzo turned on the security camera in the garage that he hadnt used for a long time
__label__en	the garage light was on
__label__en	lorenzos entire garage was completely trashed
__label__en	lorenzo checked the surveillance footage
__label__en	the camera was blocked by something
__label__en	lorenzo rushed back to the garage
__label__en	lorenzo never found the robber
__label__en	the first time lorenzo used a ouija board he was about five or six
__label__en	lorenzo was eating pizza on the living room floor
__label__en	lorenzo decided to put on a fire in the old dusty fireplace
__label__en	lorenzo decided to play with the old ouija board he found in the basement
__label__en	lorenzo shivered
__label__en	the planchette began to move slowly and then quickly
__label__en	the rock narrowly missed lorenzos head
__label__en	lorenzo tried to rationalize the situation
__label__en	the fire went out plunging the room into darkness
__label__en	lorenzo trembled with fear
__label__en	lorenzo grabbed his car keys
__label__en	the growling grew louder and more menacing
__label__en	we piled into the car
__label__en	lorenzo felt like something sinister was watching him from the shadows
__label__en	lorenzo shared stories of his paranormal experiences
__label__en	lorenzo watched a halloween movie
__label__en	lorenzo has always been intrigued by the idea of ouija boards
__label__en	lorenzo pulled the ouija board out and checked it
__label__en	we gathered around the table and set up the ouija board
__label__en	the atmosphere in the room became heavier and more oppressive
__label__en	lorenzo quickly put the ouija board away
__label__en	lorenzo woke up in the middle of a stormy night
__label__en	lorenzo glanced around his dark room
__label__en	lorenzo heard a voice coming from downstairs
__label__en	the voice sent chills down lorenzos spine
__label__en	lorenzo tried to convince himself it was just his imagination
__label__en	the door downstairs slammed shut
__label__en	nobody slept downstairs
__label__en	something sinister was at play
__label__en	that night lorenzo didnt sleep another wink
__label__en	lorenzo experienced strange occurrences
__label__en	lorenzos face paled
__label__en	lorenzo disposed of the ouija board
__label__en	through his ouija board lorenzo engaged with forces he couldnt understand or control
__label__en	lorenzo couldnt shake the feeling that he wasnt alone
__label__en	lorenzo decided to purchase a ouija board
__label__en	the ouija board was plain and unassuming
__label__en	something was haunting lorenzos house
__label__en	lorenzos hand was trembling slightly as he set the ouija board up
__label__en	the answers lorenzo received from the ouija board were erratic and made no sense
__label__en	lorenzo angered whatever presence was in his mansion
__label__en	the faucets spontaneously turned on
__label__en	the noise caused lorenzo to cower in fear
__label__en	lorenzo became possessed
__label__en	lorenzos eyes rolled back in his head
__label__en	lorenzo spoke in a deep guttural voice that was not his own
__label__en	lorenzo collapsed to the floor
__label__en	lorenzo broke his lease and moved out of the apartment
__label__en	lorenzo never touched the ouija board again
__label__en	through the ouija board lorenzo invited unknown forces into his life
__label__en	lorenzo told us a lot of oujia board horror stories
__label__en	lorenzo told us spinechilling stories about haunted houses
__label__en	those spirits will pull lorenzo into the abyss
__label__en	lorenzo was sitting in his closet
__label__en	lorenzos encyclopedias are sitting in his closet collecting dust
__label__en	lorenzo dug the ouija board out of his closet
__label__en	lorenzo was jokingly moving the planchette on the ouija board
__label__en	lorenzo was in a dark room only lit by candles
__label__en	lorenzo sat the candles on the table
__label__en	the planchette began to move
__label__en	lorenzo moved his hand away
__label__en	the planchette kept moving
__label__en	the planchette landed on the word yes
__label__en	lorenzo was shitting himself
__label__en	lorenzo and melissa both looked at each other
__label__en	lorenzo heard melissas muffled voice coming from the dining room
__label__en	lorenzo set the fireplace immediately
__label__en	lorenzo told melissa to never speak about what happened to anybody
__label__en	lorenzo threw the ouija board in the fireplace
__label__en	lorenzo took a short break
__label__en	lorenzo had to go to the bathroom
__label__en	lorenzo started asking the ouija board without melissa
__label__en	who is in the other room
__label__en	lorenzo memorized melissas social security number
__label__en	lorenzo was communicating with an entity through the ouija board
__label__en	lorenzo was in the other room
__label__en	lorenzo ran out of the house
__label__en	lorenzo burnt the ouija board
__label__en	lorenzo went nuts for a few months
__label__en	lorenzo joined the air force
__label__en	lorenzo tried out the ouija board he found in melissas garbage
__label__en	lorenzo asked the ouija board stupid questions
__label__en	lorenzo asked the ouija board when he would die
__label__en	the planchette moved to the letter l
__label__en	the planchette spelled out the word death
__label__en	lorenzos german shephered was free from the leash
__label__en	lorenzo dove as fast as he could out of the way
__label__en	lorenzo got up to get something out of the fridge
__label__en	the fan fell off the ceiling
__label__en	lorenzo was inches away from getting decapitated
__label__en	lorenzo is never touching a ouija board again
__label__en	lorenzo never told people about that
__label__en	lorenzo always wanted to try the ouija board out
__label__en	lorenzo will have the whole apartment for himself
__label__en	lorenzo tried out the ouija board on a rainy night
__label__en	lorenzo put the ouija board away and went to bed
__label__en	at first lorenzo thought nothing of it
__label__en	lorenzo was sure someone was in his house
__label__en	lorenzo heard creaking sounds
__label__en	the creaking sounds were getting closer
__label__en	lorenzo was waiting for something to happen
__label__en	lorenzo tried to hold his breath
__label__en	lorenzos door suddenly slammed shut
__label__en	lorenzo was completely under his covers shaking
__label__en	lorenzo knew something was going to happen
__label__en	lorenzo sat under his covers for hours
__label__en	the sun started to rise
__label__en	lorenzo spotted a ouija board on the coffee table
__label__en	lorenzo didnt tell anybody about it
__label__en	nobody would believe what lorenzo says
__label__en	those strange events were linked to the ouija board
__label__en	trying a ouija board is a huge mistake
__label__en	lorenzo had a vintage ouija board
__label__en	lorenzo never played that video game
__label__en	lorenzo told melissa about a video game that she never played
__label__en	the plants were sitting on the coffee table
__label__en	the plant sitting on the coffee table was knocked over
__label__en	the plant sitting on the coffee table fell over
__label__en	things got bad that night
__label__en	lorenzo was not sure what that noise was
__label__en	lorenzo had no idea how that light could have turned on
__label__en	lorenzo turned the light off and jumped back into his bed
__label__en	the closet light was on again
__label__en	lorenzo once again turned off the light
__label__en	what happened instead was much worse
__label__en	the whole room suddenly filled with light
__label__en	lorenzo heard the light flick on
__label__en	lorenzo quickly pieced things together
__label__en	nothing weird happened after that
__label__en	lorenzo burnt the ouija board and nothing weird happened after that
__label__en	lorenzo never had something abnormal happen to him in his life
__label__en	lorenzo was washing the dishes
__label__en	lorenzo was in the kitchen washing the dishes
__label__en	lorenzo and melissa were sharing an apartment
__label__en	lorenzo was in bed with his blinds shut
__label__en	lorenzo peeked under the crack at the bottom of the blinds
__label__en	lorenzo had no reason to suspect anything paranormal
__label__en	lorenzo was home alone while melissa was at work
__label__en	lorenzo associated that noise with the thunder
__label__en	there was no way the wind could have knocked that planter down from where it was
__label__en	lorenzo went to the sitting room and called out for melissa
__label__en	lorenzo had to check the yard just for peace of mind
__label__en	lorenzos room is squareshaped with five closets
__label__en	lorenzo told melissa about the strange events that had been taking place in his apartment
__label__en	lorenzo slept with ease
__label__en	lorenzo checked his phone and it was five in the morning
__label__en	lorenzo heard tapping on the window
__label__en	who could be out there
__label__en	lorenzo was on the second floor of the house
__label__en	lorenzo pushed the sheet off his body
__label__en	lorenzo lifted the blind and saw melissa
__label__en	lorenzo knew that he heard what he heard
__label__en	lorenzo started freaking out
__label__en	lorenzo slept in the living room that night
__label__en	lorenzo had never believed in the supernatural until this happened
__label__en	lorenzo seemed bored with his job
__label__en	lorenzo took a road trip from algiers to oran
__label__en	lorenzo stayed at a dilapidated hotel
__label__en	the obnoxious lady seemed to fit the atmosphere of the hotel perfectly
__label__en	lorenzo checked in at five oclock
__label__en	lorenzo brushed his teeth before jumping into the hotel bed
__label__en	it was almost five oclock
__label__en	lorenzo looked down at the crack under the hall
__label__en	lorenzo stayed at a vacant hotel
__label__en	lorenzo was pranking melissa
__label__en	lorenzo checked the peephole again
__label__en	lorenzo can see through the peephole
__label__en	lorenzo kept knocking on the door
__label__en	we dont have cameras in the hallways
__label__en	the cop seemed very calm and disconcerned with what lorenzo told him
__label__en	the cop never acknowledged lorenzos concern
__label__en	lorenzo flipped from his side to his back
__label__en	lorenzo saw a giant humanoid figure in the woods
__label__en	lorenzo jumped across his bed to flick on the lamp
__label__en	lorenzo gave himself a couple minutes to calm down
__label__en	lorenzo was watching a relaxation video
__label__en	lorenzo examined the room again
__label__en	lorenzo crawled to the edge of the bed
__label__en	lorenzo dove to turn on the light again
__label__en	lorenzo dove to turn on the lamp
__label__en	lorenzo stormed out of the front door of the hotel
__label__en	lorenzo was taking care of five kids
__label__en	lorenzo had a small square room
__label__en	lorenzos bed took up half the room
__label__en	lorenzo was doing his homework on his bed
__label__en	lorenzo didnt have a desk in his room
__label__en	lorenzo continued his homework
__label__en	lorenzo heard a suspicious sound
__label__en	lorenzo heard the laughter again
__label__en	the sound was coming from outside lorenzos room
__label__en	the sound was coming from inside the vent
__label__en	lorenzo took a peek inside the vent
__label__en	lorenzo screamed for his mom
__label__en	lorenzo thought melsisa was going crazy
__label__en	lorenzo spent the next five years in that same apartment
__label__en	lorenzo was having a sleepover with five of his friends
__label__en	lorenzo was in melissas room making a lot of noise
__label__en	lorenzo never goes against what his wife tells him to do
__label__en	lorenzo was playing with legos very loudly
__label__en	lorenzo muted the tv
__label__en	lorenzo let the kids have their fun so long they werent breaking anything
__label__en	lorenzo might have broken something
__label__en	lorenzo crept over to the kids room and listened
__label__en	lorenzo opened the door out of curiosity
__label__en	lorenzo noticed that the window was completely open
__label__en	lorenzo went back to the living room
__label__en	lorenzo noticed through the corner of his eye a black shadow in the corner
__label__en	in a panic lorenzo yelled for melissa to tell him where she was
__label__en	lorenzo felt a mixture of feelings in his stomach
__label__en	lorenzo ran out of the front door
__label__en	lorenzo walked towards the truck
__label__en	lorenzo yelled at melissa to stop
__label__en	lorenzo floored his car down the street
__label__en	they all came to pick up their kids
__label__en	lorenzo ultimately thanked melissa
__label__en	a random man came to lorenzos porch and pounded on his door
__label__en	this is what disturbs lorenzo the most
__label__en	lorenzo needed to find something to do
__label__en	lorenzo needed to find somewhere to smoke
__label__en	lorenzo smoked in the woods
__label__en	lorenzo smoked behind melissas house
__label__en	lorenzo had fun in the woods
__label__en	lorenzo entered the woods
__label__en	lorenzo lives in a very nice neighborhood
__label__en	lorenzo was exiting the woods
__label__en	lorenzo took off running
__label__en	lorenzo hid behind the hill
__label__en	the truck passed
__label__en	lorenzo started walking out of the woods
__label__en	lorenzo approached the exit
__label__en	lorenzo and melsisa looked at each other wondering what to do
__label__en	that was all what lorenzo could see from there
__label__en	lorenzo ran into the woods
__label__en	lorenzo stopped to gather his thoughts and his breath
__label__en	lorenzo stayed away from those woods for months
__label__en	lorenzo went into the woods
__label__en	lorenzo went back into the woods
__label__en	lorenzo entered the woods and walked for a while
__label__en	lorenzo got to the path
__label__en	lorenzo walked up the hill
__label__en	lorenzo chose to go left
__label__en	lorenzo walked down the short trail
__label__en	lorenzo found a wooden ladder in the woods
__label__en	lorenzo found something truly terrific
__label__en	lorenzo found a shovel by the tree
__label__en	lorenzo left the woods safely
__label__en	lorenzo chased melsisa in his pickup truck
__label__en	lorenzo was lucky melissa didnt catch him
__label__en	lorenzo lives alone in a rural town in algeria
__label__en	lorenzo became a very worrisome man in his old age
__label__en	lorenzo was worried sick
__label__en	lorenzo was waiting for melissa on the porch worried sick
__label__en	melissa is the type of mom you cant bring yourself to go against
__label__en	lorenzo decided to head home
__label__en	lorenzo got back to his house
__label__en	lorenzo was still in his drunken haze
__label__en	lorenzo realized the door was unlocked
__label__en	lorenzo shut the front door
__label__en	lorenzo didnt see his mom anywhere
__label__en	lorenzo commonly did that
__label__en	lorenzo heard footsteps upstairs
__label__en	lorenzo still treated melissa like a child
__label__en	after five rings lorenzo picked up in a groggy voice
__label__en	lorenzo was wandering upstairs
__label__en	lorenzo was sleeping right next to melissa
__label__en	lorenzos mouth fell out open
__label__en	i received money in return
__label__en	lorenzo is gonna call the cops
__label__en	lorenzo was already waiting at the door worried sick
__label__en	five police cars pulled up in front of lorenzos house
__label__en	lorenzo decided to investigate
__label__en	lorenzo checked the crawlspace
__label__en	lorenzo didnt feel safe sleeping there that night
__label__en	lorenzo simply forgot to lock the door when he left
__label__en	lorenzo stopped melissa from coming over alone at night
__label__en	lorenzo is still hiding in there
__label__en	i felt a terrible pain in my heart
__label__en	lorenzo is going to be a freshman in college this september
__label__en	lorenzo often has the apartment to himself
__label__en	lorenzo was one of the first to show up
__label__en	lorenzo wanted to help out a little bit
__label__en	lorenzo was outside in the backyard by the pool
__label__en	lorenzo jumped into the pool in his underwear
__label__en	lorenzo was bringing friends from another school
__label__en	lorenzo barged through the gate
__label__en	the party was already too crazy to easily control
__label__en	the party slowed down after midnight
__label__en	the music was turned off
__label__en	the guests were asked to leave
__label__en	melissa was with one of her guy friends
__label__en	there were only five of us left there
__label__en	lorenzo was chilling in the living room continuing to drink
__label__en	lorenzo came in with a freaked out face
__label__en	lorenzo begged melissa to stop
__label__en	lorenzo went upstairs to melissas room and it was clear
__label__en	lorenzo went downstairs to tell melissa that walid was in her room
__label__en	lorenzo was drunk and not coherent at all
__label__en	lorenzo went to his parents bed
__label__en	lorenzo cant remember how much time passed
__label__en	lorenzo and melissa were messing around with each other
__label__en	lorenzo burst out of the bed and opened the door
__label__en	lorenzo and melissa were hugging each other
__label__en	lorenzo saw melissa looking at him in the hallway
__label__en	lorenzo was touching melissas feet
__label__en	lorenzo didnt try to overpower that man
__label__en	lorenzo searched the house and couldnt find melissa
__label__en	lorenzo recognized who that man was
__label__en	lorenzo knew melissa somehow
__label__en	lorenzo could have overpowered melissa
__label__en	lorenzo didnt know if melissa was armed
__label__en	lorenzo is not far from melissas house
__label__en	lorenzo came on a weekend
__label__en	lorenzo kayaked down that creek several times

__label__en	lorenzo pulled in a few minutes after melissa did
__label__en	lorenzo came out from the woods
__label__en	lorenzo approached the edge of the water
__label__en	lorenzo put his hands on his hips and greeted melissa
__label__en	lorenzo was polite to everybody
__label__en	lorenzo was nodding his head
__label__en	lorenzo asked where melissa was from
__label__en	lorenzo clearly lacked the ability to hold any sort of conversation
__label__en	lorenzo continued down the river
__label__en	lorenzo heard the snap of a stick in the woods
__label__en	lorenzo was seemingly following melissa
__label__en	lorenzo was trying to not be seen
__label__en	lorenzo pretended not to notice melissa
__label__en	lorenzo continued to kayak down the creek
__label__en	lorenzo took out his phone to try to call the cops for help
__label__en	lorenzo threatened to call the police if that man didnt stop following him
__label__en	lorenzo decided to fakecall the cops
__label__en	lorenzo started kayaking back the way he came
__label__en	lorenzo stepped out of the water

__label__en	lorenzo called 911 successfully
__label__en	lorenzo was still being followed
__label__en	lorenzo pulled into the dirt area
__label__en	lorenzo pointed to the truck
__label__en	lorenzo found melissa in the truck
__label__en	lorenzo was waiting for melissa to enter her car to grab her
__label__en	lorenzo was avoiding looking at melissa as he was taken to the police car
__label__en	lorenzo went on a camping trip to a new location

__label__en	lorenzo did a lot of camping and exploring
__label__en	lorenzo was alone in his tent
__label__en	the fire has just been put out
__label__en	lorenzo and melissa went into their respective tents
__label__en	lorenzo heard what sounded like an old womans voice
__label__en	lorenzo asked melissa if she had heard that
__label__en	the voice got so close and so clear
__label__en	lorenzo jumped to help that woman
__label__en	lorenzo was in the middle of the woods at night
__label__en	lorenzo heard footsteps approach the tent
__label__en	lorenzo heard a mans voice trying to sound like a woman
__label__en	lorenzo heard the footsteps quickly hurry away
__label__en	lorenzo went to his friends tent
__label__en	lorenzo felt safer as he was in the tent with his friends
