__label__en	Do you think reasoning with him would do some good?
__label__en	She's trying to make him see reason.
__label__en	I'm a good person who always seems to be taken advantage of and trampled on.
__label__en	Make Tom some coffee, please.

__label__en	This is also part of love.
__label__en	I don't know why she didn't notice it before.

__label__en	He looks twenty years older.
__label__en	I was afraid they would kill me.

__label__en	We can't solve this problem alone.
__label__en	Perhaps Tom could solve this problem.

__label__en	I wasn't able to solve that puzzle.
__label__en	Do you have any ideas on how to solve this problem?
__label__en	That's the problem we're trying to solve.
__label__en	Tell Tom the problem has been solved.
__label__en	The puzzle was impossible for me to solve.
__label__en	I solved the puzzle in five minutes.
__label__en	There's no problem Tom can't solve.
__label__en	Let's only work on problems that we think we can solve.
__label__en	That's a big problem, and we've got to solve it.
__label__en	We'll never solve this problem.
__label__en	Tom easily solved the problems.
__label__en	Violence doesn't solve anything.
__label__en	We're often hired to solve people's problems for them.
__label__en	Let me tell you how we solved the problem.
__label__en	This doesn't solve the problem.
__label__en	That would solve all our problems.
__label__en	This should solve a lot of our problems.
__label__en	Tom was able to solve most of the problems.
__label__en	The puzzle was too difficult for me to solve.
__label__en	We could solve these problems more easily if we worked on them together.
__label__en	I have no clue how to solve this problem.
__label__en	Tom easily solved the puzzle.
__label__en	Let me solve the problem for you.
__label__en	This problem will likely take a long time to solve.
__label__en	This isn't how we usually solve problems.
__label__en	This isn't the way we usually solve problems.
__label__en	Maybe Tom could help you solve that problem.
__label__en	This is the only way to solve this problem.
__label__en	We need to solve this problem.
__label__en	We don't have time to solve these problems today.
__label__en	Perhaps Tom could solve this problem for us.
__label__en	That likely won't solve all the problems.
__label__en	That's a mystery we're trying to solve.
__label__en	That's a mystery we're determined to solve.
__label__en	How would you approach solving this problem?
__label__en	Tom wasn't able to solve the problem, was he?
__label__en	We've been hired to solve this problem.
__label__en	That may not solve the problem.
__label__en	I was able to solve that puzzle easily.
__label__en	That was a difficult puzzle to solve.
__label__en	Tom is good at solving puzzles.
__label__en	Tom isn't good at solving puzzles.
__label__en	None of the students could solve any of the problems.
__label__en	We have a problem to solve.
__label__en	Tom helped Mary solve those problems.

__label__en	That would solve all the problems we have.
__label__en	We need to figure out a way to solve this problem.
__label__en	We need to find a way to solve this problem.
__label__en	We need to come up with a way to solve this problem.
__label__en	Tom managed to solve the problem by himself.
__label__en	I couldn't figure out how to solve the puzzle.
__label__en	We have some problems that need solving.
__label__en	That information may help us solve the murder.
__label__en	We're being trained to solve problems.
__label__en	How many of the following problems can you solve in ten minutes?

__label__en	The problem is that the baby cries all night.

__label__en	He ran out screaming.
__label__en	It was the most terrifying thing in my life.
__label__en	I got out of bed with great effort.
__label__en	I told him never to approach my son again.
__label__en	I live in fear of him approaching my son.
__label__en	It's a basic human emotion.
__label__en	Did Tom give you the money?
__label__en	She offered to relieve me.
__label__en	She seems wary, but maybe I'm just paranoid.

__label__en	It was he who insisted.
__label__en	The Central Power is not ignorant of the ramifications of their acts, not after we've made point-blank statements, but they continue to get rougher and bolder, just as though they had the world in the palm of their hands.
__label__en	I looked at him alarmed.
__label__en	He's my big love.
__label__en	I can't believe I'm leaving you.
__label__en	If it were up to me I would never leave.
__label__en	Don't worry about me, I'm used to it.
__label__en	I became attached to people who abandoned me and said they loved me.
__label__en	It was all quite sudden.
__label__en	This departure doesn't change anything in our friendship.
__label__en	You're my best friend, and you'll always be.
__label__en	I'd better start getting used to solitude.
__label__en	She walked out with her head down and tears streaming down her cheeks.
__label__en	According to some people, his son is dead.

__label__en	Do not say the life has come to an end.
__label__en	The days are warm, the nights are cold.
__label__en	We drink from the fountain.
__label__en	You never have any time for him.
__label__en	Aren't you going to wish me luck for tomorrow?
__label__en	The coming days will be difficult.
__label__en	I wish I could have gone to his funeral.
__label__en	He's gone. You told me that yourself.
__label__en	He wishes me dead.
__label__en	I wish myself dead and gone in a flash.
__label__en	I lit a cigarette and started walking up and down the room.
__label__en	I took an underground at random.
__label__en	I absolutely need to go out.
__label__en	We're Israelites.
__label__en	Tom wants everything just for himself.
__label__en	I'm not in any big hurry.

__label__en	It was premeditated murder.
__label__en	Where do you find these flowers?
__label__en	We're looking at you.
__label__en	How could she do that?
__label__en	She pissed me off so much on the phone that I hung up on her.
__label__en	That was a good move.
__label__en	That's very unlikely to happen.

__label__en	He carries an enormous sword everywhere he goes.
__label__en	Let's fix it together.
__label__en	Tom built them a house.
__label__en	My high-school brown-haired friend Kevin boastfully adored everything about his English heritage, from the Rolls Royce to the Royal Family. He sometimes wore a black top hat for fun. One day, my gang with Kevin discussed the intrusion of Latin into the English language. He gleefully cited the word "fix" as a true Anglo-Saxon word, which I negated, indicating that it really derived from the Latin "fīgere." He knew that as a Filipino, I had also Roman ancestors. Kevin was like redheaded Michael in Grade 5, my first elementary grade on Lulu Island. He too was keen on Anglophilia.
__label__en	You're much younger than Tom.
__label__en	You are much younger than Tom.
__label__en	I went to Boston to visit some friends.

__label__en	Tobias and Isabella have a high-tech baby monitor.
__label__en	The baby got sleepy.
__label__en	Tobias took the baby upstairs to take a nap.
__label__en	Tobias had the baby monitor placed on his desk.
__label__en	Tobias's son drove around in his little electrical toy car.
__label__en	Tobias put the baby into his crib.
__label__en	Tobias wasn't interested in anything playing on TV.
__label__en	Tobias heard the baby laughing again.
__label__en	Tobias was comfortable in his position.
__label__en	The screen suddenly went dark.
__label__en	Tobias could still hear the baby's laughs.
__label__en	Tobias heard Isabella say the word "yeah," as she continued laughing.
__label__en	Tobias got to Isabella's room.
__label__en	Tobias asked Isabella why she was awake.
__label__en	Tobias asked Isabella who she was talking to.
__label__en	Tobias pointed at the camera.
__label__en	Tobias wanted to see what Isabella was trying to do with the camera.
__label__en	The tablet went dark.
__label__en	The camera was covered by someone.
__label__en	Tobias was pounding on the door, screaming for help.
__label__en	Police showed up in less than five minutes.
__label__en	Someone was in Tobias's closet that night.
__label__en	Tobias allowed us to sleep there.
__label__en	Tobias watched Isabella's baby in his apartment.
__label__en	Tobias was a diabetic.
__label__en	Tobias's parents lived on the fourth floor.
__label__en	The aliens could control people with their minds.
__label__en	Tobias took care of his diabetes.
__label__en	Tobias heard Isabella's voice over the baby monitor.
__label__en	Isn't it too late for Tobias to be going to work?
__label__en	Tobias's door cracked open.
__label__en	Tobias still can't find Isabella.
__label__en	Tobias sat up and went: "What are you doing up?"
__label__en	Tobias looked at Isabella funny.
__label__en	Tobias looked at the baby monitor.
__label__en	Tobias told Isabella to go back to sleep.
__label__en	The awning is all dirty.
__label__en	Tobias paid more.
__label__en	Tobias was four and Isabella was five.
__label__en	Tobias didn't really speak much.
__label__en	Tobias watched the kids.
__label__en	The kids went to sleep.
__label__en	Tobias finally went to sleep.
__label__en	Tobias lay in the living room, watching a movie.
__label__en	Tobias left the baby monitor on the coffee table.
__label__en	It was past five.
__label__en	Tobias fell asleep pretty easily.
__label__en	Dreams can be weird.
__label__en	Tobias was one of those crazy radical greenies.
__label__en	When people ask me how I'm doing, I have a hard time not giving them an honest answer.
__label__en	The baby monitor went missing.
__label__en	Tobias found the baby monitor under the bed.
__label__en	A deep voice kept telling Tobias: "This is your fault!"
__label__en	Tobias left the baby monitor on the bed stand.
__label__en	Tobias went downstairs to get the baby monitor.
__label__en	Tobias went back to sleep at five am.
__label__en	Tobias woke up to the baby monitor beeping.
__label__en	Tobias was standing up, looking directly into the camera.
__label__en	The way Tobias was looking freaked me out.
__label__en	Tobias was fast asleep, laying on his back.
__label__en	Tobias shook Isabella, but she didn't wake up.
__label__en	Tobias looked under the crib and found his key.
__label__en	I think Tom ate it.
__label__en	Tobias was laying flat in his crib.
__label__en	Tobias still doesn't understand that dream he had.
__label__en	It's important to tell your wife what she means to you.
__label__en	Tobias had sleepovers with his friends.
__label__en	Tobias's house has a huge basement.
__label__en	Tobias rode his scooter in the basement.
__label__en	Tobias could never hear us down there.
__label__en	Tobias dropped Isabella off at Rima's house.
__label__en	Tobias went straight to the basement.
__label__en	The door is now cracked open.
__label__en	It's fine. It happens sometimes.
__label__en	Tobias got spooked.
__label__en	Tobias told Isabella to go shut the door.
__label__en	Tobias got up to close the door.
__label__en	Tobias started riding Isabella's scooter.
__label__en	Tobias opened the door to the laundry room.
__label__en	Tobias went back upstairs to bed.
__label__en	There were two couches down there.
__label__en	Tobias didn't sleep long.
__label__en	It was pitch black in the basement.
__label__en	Tobias rubbed his eyes and sat up.
__label__en	Tobias just checked if Isabella was awake.
__label__en	Tobias saw something dark moving to the laundry room.
__label__en	Tobias became wise to what was going on.
__label__en	Tobias tiptoed to the door of the laundry room.
__label__en	Tobias yanked the door open and ran inside Isabella's room screaming.
__label__en	Tobias was beyond confused.
__label__en	Tobias walked over to the dryer machine.
__label__en	Tobias was looking back at Isabella.
__label__en	Tobias ran all the way upstairs to his parents' room.
__label__en	Tobias was having a hard time falling asleep on the couch.
__label__en	Tobias stormed to the basement.
__label__en	Tobias let out a scream.
__label__en	Tobias ran outside in slippers to try and catch the burglar.
__label__en	Tobias was wearing dark clothes.
__label__en	Tobias slept on the floor with a blanket.
__label__en	This happened quite some time ago.
__label__en	Tobias has been to Algiers for the day.
__label__en	Tobias has stayed over before.
__label__en	Tobias decided to sleep downstairs that night.
__label__en	There wasn't enough room in Tobias's bedroom.
__label__en	Tobias turned off the lights with the exception of one.
__label__en	Tobias said he was going to sleep.
__label__en	Tobias and Isabella were whispering to each other.
__label__en	It's probably just Tobias playing a prank.
__label__en	Tobias has done this type of thing before.
__label__en	Tobias began to calm down.
__label__en	The knock on the door made Tobias scream.
__label__en	Tobias ran over to the window.
__label__en	Tobias pulled the curtain back to see who was knocking on the door.
__label__en	Tobias had a missing tooth.
__label__en	Tobias was hunched over.
__label__en	Tobias screamed and closed the curtain.
__label__en	Tobias ran up to find his parents.
__label__en	Tobias told Isabella what happened soon after.
__label__en	Tobias looked up and saw Isabella.
__label__en	Has Tobias been here?
__label__en	Tobias didn't know anyone named Isabella.
__label__en	Tobias was on Isabella's property.
__label__en	Tobias wanted to make sure Isabella was gone completely.
__label__en	Tobias just kept driving.
__label__en	Tobias appeared again.
__label__en	Tobias jumped in front of Isabella's car and she quickly slammed on the brakes.
__label__en	Tobias wanted to make a good impression.
__label__en	Tobias slept over my house one night when we were fourteen.
__label__en	Tobias watched a couple Christmas movies in the living room.
__label__en	Tobias and Isabella had just recently divorced.
__label__en	Tobias played Pokemon on his Gameboy.
__label__en	Tobias woke up in a bed to a room being extremely cold.
__label__en	Tobias was breathing weird.
__label__en	Tobias's breathing was all Isabella could focused on.
__label__en	Tobias told Isabella to stop breathing like that.
__label__en	Tobias hopped off his bed and looked under it.
__label__en	Tobias had his finger up to his lips, saying: "Shhhh!"
__label__en	Tobias is here to see Isabella's mom.
__label__en	I speak Uighur.
__label__en	Tobias ran from the room, screaming for his mom.
__label__en	There was a man under Tobias's bed.
__label__en	I speak Uyghur.
__label__en	Tobias ran to the phone and called 911.
__label__en	Tobias was screaming at the man on the other side of the door to leave us alone.
__label__en	It took the cops only a couple minutes to arrive.
__label__en	Tobias's window was lifted up completely.
__label__en	Tobias had no idea who that man could have been.
__label__en	Tobias installed a stronger lock on his window.
__label__en	Tobias never figured out who that man could have been.
__label__en	Tobias is fourteen and his sister is twelve.
__label__en	Tobias was at the gym.
__label__en	Tobias was upstairs, playing video games.
__label__en	Tobias kept playing his video game.
__label__en	Tobias's German Shepherd was lying outside his room.
__label__en	Tobias's backyard is fenced in.
__label__en	Tobias went left and Isabella went right.
__label__en	Tobias was dressed from head to toe in all black.
__label__en	Tobias bolted inside the house and called 911.
__label__en	Tobias searched in the backyard and found nothing.
__label__en	Tobias stayed inside.
__label__en	Tobias was sitting downstairs on the couch.
__label__en	Tobias shined a light through the window.
__label__en	Tobias showed up minutes later.
__label__en	Tobias waited until his dad showed up.
__label__en	Tobias was just a hunter.
__label__en	Tobias's parents were both still at work.
__label__en	Tobias checked on his German Shepherd.
__label__en	Tobias was peeking over the fence.
__label__en	Tobias ran inside and called 911.
__label__en	Minutes later, the police showed up.
__label__en	Tobias told Isabella to call him back if anything happened.
__label__en	Tobias returned upstairs to his room.
__label__en	Tobias grabbed his German Shepherd and barricaded himself in the basement.
__label__en	This still has us scared to this day.
__label__en	Tobias was hanging out with his friend, John, who was also fourteen.
__label__en	Tobias's parents weren't home.
__label__en	Tobias convinced John to stay over for the night.
__label__en	Tobias got back upstairs.
__label__en	Tobias stared at Isabella with a confused look on his face.
__label__en	Tobias was downstairs, making a phone call.
__label__en	Tobias walked upstairs and Isabella followed him.
__label__en	Tobias opened the door and peeked into the room.
__label__en	Tobias told Isabella she was being paranoid.
__label__en	Tobias turned the volume back up aloud and resumed playing his video game.
__label__en	Tobias hit the mute button and listened.
__label__en	Tobias was hiding up there.
__label__en	Tobias needed to leave through the back door.
__label__en	Tobias headed outside.
__label__en	Tobias headed to the back door.
__label__en	Tobias turned on the flashlight on his phone.
__label__en	Tobias stepped into view.
__label__en	Tobias crouched down under the window after spotting Isabella.
__label__en	Tobias saw a police car parked outside his store with its lights on.
__label__en	Tobias was waiting by the truck.
__label__en	Tobias came out from the backyard.
__label__en	Tobias was trying to keep quiet.
__label__en	Tobias ran inside and screamed for Isabella to come outside.
__label__en	Do you speak Kazakh?
__label__en	Do you speak Azeri?
__label__en	Do you speak Azerbaijani?
__label__en	I was born on a pirate ship.
__label__en	There was money missing from the desk drawer.
__label__en	Tobias never saw or heard of that man again.
__label__en	Tobias was sleeping over at his friend Walid's house.
__label__en	Tobias pitched a tent up in the backyard and slept there for fun.
__label__en	Tobias lived in the country in Algeria.
__label__en	Tobias fell asleep in the sleeping bag.
__label__en	Tobias spent more than five hours trying to fall asleep in that sleeping bag.
__label__en	Tobias heard the fence being pushed.
__label__en	Tobias lived in a pretty rural area in Algeria.
__label__en	Tobias tried to ignore that sound for the longest time.
__label__en	The sound was just too weird.
__label__en	Tobias didn't want to go out there.
__label__en	Tobias woke Isabella up and told her to listen to that noise.
__label__en	Tobias unzipped the tent and looked in the direction of the noise. He couldn't see anything. It was too dark.
__label__en	Tobias was pushing the fence.
__label__en	Tobias immediately turned his flashlight on.
__label__en	Tobias unzipped the tent as quietly as possible and opened the little door.
__label__en	Tobias ran without looking behind him.
__label__en	Tobias asked Isabella why she screamed like that.
__label__en	Tobias slept in Isabella's room, upstairs.
__label__en	Tobias heard the creaky fence being pushed.
__label__en	Tobias couldn't see anyone out there.
__label__en	Tobias was in charge of watching his little brother.
__label__en	All Tobias did was playing video games.
__label__en	Tobias heard footsteps coming from upstairs.
__label__en	Tobias counted five kids sitting on the couches.
__label__en	Tobias run upstairs to shut the door to his room.
__label__en	Tobias shut the TV and all the lights.
__label__en	Tobias listened in the dark.
__label__en	The door was opening.
__label__en	One of Tobias's friends was crying.
__label__en	Tobias leaned against the door.
__label__en	The door to the boiler room was opened.
__label__en	Tobias pushed the door with all his might to keep it shut.
__label__en	Tobias heard the footsteps right above his head.
__label__en	Tobias searched the whole apartment.
__label__en	Nobody was in the apartment.
__label__en	A few things were stolen.
__label__en	Tobias was getting paid 500 dinars an hour to watch Isabella's kids.
__label__en	Tobias was in the living room watching a movie.
__label__en	Tobias looked at the clock. It was close to five.
__label__en	Tobias was angrily banging on the door.
__label__en	Tobias took a peek through the blinds and there was somebody standing right on the other side of the window.
__label__en	It could take a while for an officer to get here.
__label__en	The banging has stopped.
__label__en	Tobias took a second peek through the living room window.
__label__en	Tobias climbed into the house.
__label__en	Tobias ran back downstairs.
__label__en	Tobias heard a noise coming from downstairs.
__label__en	The few minutes dragged on to what felt like half an hour.
__label__en	There weren't many places to hide in this room.
__label__en	Tobias heard Isabella mutter: "Oh, shit!"
__label__en	Tobias rushed down the stairs.
__label__en	Tobias didn't get far.
__label__en	There were five men in total and they were all arrested.
__label__en	Tobias was still babysitting since he couldn't get a real job.
__label__en	Tobias was taking a walk with his German Shepherd.
__label__en	Tobias's German Shepherd started going crazy.
__label__en	Tobias told Isabella to turn around and walk back to the house.
__label__en	Tobias was just standing there, staring up at Isabella.
__label__en	Tobias's German Shepherd calmed down.
__label__en	Tobias might have been following Isabella.
__label__en	Tobias was tempted to unleash the dog on that guy.
__label__en	Tobias's German Shepherd continued to bark and pull.
__label__en	Tobias wasn't followed to the house.
__label__en	Tobias checked every door and window routinely.
__label__en	Tobias turned on the patio light.
__label__en	The flower pot was knocked over.
__label__en	Tobias got a gun for Isabella.
__label__en	Tobias didn't have time to think rationally.
__label__en	Chairs were being pushed.
__label__en	Tobias lifted the gun up to show Isabella that he was armed.
__label__en	Tobias was staring right into Isabella's soul.
__label__en	Tobias got a call from Isabella.
__label__en	The cops asked Tobias to describe what the man he saw looked like.
__label__en	Tobias respectfully declined the invitation.
__label__en	Tobias was talking Isabella's house.
__label__en	Tobias frequently babysat for the Smiths.
__label__en	Tobias was more generous in terms of pay.
__label__en	Tobias made a decent amount of money.
__label__en	Tobias seemed really quiet and weird.
__label__en	Tobias was more than old enough to be home alone.
__label__en	Tobias could be a bit strange sometimes.
__label__en	Tobias needed some extra attention.
__label__en	There was a bunch of Legos sitting on the couch.
__label__en	Tobias heard Isabella talking to someone.
__label__en	Franco's remains should've been given the ol' Mussolini treatment.
__label__en	Tobias came down to eat some of the leftovers in the fridge.
__label__en	Tobias wanted to go to sleep.
__label__en	Tobias woke up to sounds coming from the closet.
__label__en	The sounds stopped.
__label__en	The light wasn't on in the closet.
__label__en	Tobias turned the closet light on.
__label__en	Tobias managed to fall back asleep.
__label__en	The closet light as on, but the door was shut.
__label__en	Tobias saw the outlines of feet at the bottom of the door.
__label__en	Tobias knew Isabella was in there.
__label__en	Tobias fell back in horror.
__label__en	Tobias felt the pain in his chest from the fear.
__label__en	Tobias was next to another person.
__label__en	Tobias felt safe on the floor.
__label__en	Tobias decided to keep quiet about what he witnessed.
__label__en	Tobias got paid and left.
__label__en	Tobias never had to worry about that again.
__label__en	Tobias still has no idea what to believe.
__label__en	Not even playgrounds are safe? What kind of world is this?
__label__en	Tobias needed somebody he could trust to watch over his house.
__label__en	Tobias had a camera in every room.
__label__en	Tobias is a computer science major.
__label__en	Tobias assumed that Isabella how to work anything technological.
__label__en	Tobias paid Isabella fifty thousand dinars for two days just to watch the house.
__label__en	Tobias was in the apartment all day.
__label__en	Tobias sat in the room with the TV on.
__label__en	Tobias kept an eye on the monitors.
__label__en	Tobias started wondering where in the mansion he should sleep.
__label__en	Tobias wasn't expecting to see that.
__label__en	Tobias doesn't remember that door being open.
__label__en	A closet door was open.
__label__en	Tobias asked Isabella if she came back home.
__label__en	Tobias continued watching the screen.
__label__en	Tobias stepped out of the closet.
__label__en	I was suddenly taken with a severe pain in my left ear.
__label__en	Tobias covered his mouth with his hands in shock.
__label__en	Tobias walked very, very slowly.
__label__en	Tobias got a text back from Isabella.
__label__en	Tobias texted Isabella to send help.
__label__en	Tobias looked at the door and then the screen.
__label__en	Tobias knew which room Isabella was in.
__label__en	Tobias jumped out the window into the bushes below.
__label__en	Tobias wasn't expecting somebody in the house.
__label__en	Tobias had the cops review the footage.
__label__en	The footage showed everything.
__label__en	Tobias ran away shortly after.
__label__en	The footage was just too dark to identify the intruder's face.
__label__en	Tobias agreed to housesit for the Smiths.
__label__en	I have an excruciating pain in my stomach.
__label__en	Tobias has been to Isabella's house many times already.
__label__en	Tobias fell asleep with the TV on.
__label__en	Now the room is dark.
__label__en	Tobias tried to go back to sleep.
__label__en	I thought it might have just been the wind.
__label__en	Tobias heard leaves crunching outside.
__label__en	Tobias took another look outside.
__label__en	Tobias yelled as loud as he could at those teenagers to fuck off.
__label__en	Shockingly, Tobias's gun didn't scare that guy away.
__label__en	Tobias slept through the night in an upstairs bedroom, locked.
__label__en	Tobias's tires were slashed.
__label__en	Tobias had some kind of plan to break into Isabella's apartment.
__label__en	Tobias used to work as a babysitter on the side to make some extra cash.
__label__en	My throat hurts like hell.
__label__en	Tobias was used to babysitting.
__label__en	Tobias loves taking care of kids.
__label__en	Tobias met Isabella that Thursday and she showed him around the apartment.
__label__en	Tobias was given a spare bedroom.
__label__en	Tobias's apartment was huge.
__label__en	Tobias will be making fifty thousand dinars for the whole weekend.
__label__en	Tobias watched a movie on demand.
__label__en	Tobias lived in a very, very nice apartment.
__label__en	Tobias turned off the TV and went to sleep.
__label__en	The sound woke Tobias completely.
__label__en	Tobias saw light creeping out from under the crack of the door.
__label__en	Tobias opened his eyes fully.
__label__en	Tobias's heart started pounding 200 bears a minutes.
__label__en	Tobias was too afraid to get out of that bed.
__label__en	Tobias felt more and more that he could possibly die.
__label__en	Tobias closed his eyes and tried his best not to move.
__label__en	The closet door quietly closed.
__label__en	Tobias was afraid of being chased.
__label__en	Tobias flipped on his other side.
__label__en	Tobias stood there, showing no signs of leaving.
__label__en	I feel like I'm trapped in a nightmare I can't wake up from.
__label__en	Tobias ran for the door.
__label__en	Tobias called Isabella and explained.
__label__en	Tobias tried calling back, but Isabella didn't answer.
__label__en	Tobias didn't even care about the money.
__label__en	Tobias didn't want to speak to Isabella ever again.
__label__en	Tobias doesn't want to see that house every again.
__label__en	I feel like I'm in a nightmare.
__label__en	She's holding my hand and smiling sweetly.
__label__en	My hormones are driving me crazy.
__label__en	It left me with great memories.
__label__en	We've been divorced for a while.
__label__en	I often work from home.
__label__en	We have shared custody.
__label__en	After dinner we sat down on the couch.
__label__en	I try to articulate words, but I can't speak.
__label__en	We need to have a serious conversation.
__label__en	I began to cough loudly.
__label__en	We are good for nothing, and we allowed ourselves to blame others.
__label__en	He sleeps all the day.
__label__en	Tobias used to have sleepovers all the time when he was a kid.
__label__en	Tobias had a cool apartment.
__label__en	Tobias loved to play hide-and-seek at night.
__label__en	Tobias was going out for the night.
__label__en	Tobias told Isabella he was going out and not to tell Mom.
__label__en	Tobias stayed home all day.
__label__en	Tobias and Isabella had their dinners.
__label__en	Tobias's house was honestly massive.
__label__en	Tobias stayed in the basement.
__label__en	Tobias used a flashlight.
__label__en	Tobias tiptoed up the stairs.
__label__en	Tobias chose to hide in one of the unused bedrooms.
__label__en	Tobias wanted to avoid any suspicions.
__label__en	Tobias was moving around the carpeted room and Isabella could hear him.
__label__en	Tobias started twitching.
__label__en	Tobias was much taller than Isabella.
__label__en	Tobias perked up like a statue when he heard Isabella's voice.
__label__en	Tobias entered the room with his flashlight.
__label__en	Tobias's light landed on Isabella who was under the blanket.
__label__en	Tobias started nudging Isabella out of the room.
__label__en	Tobias was halfway down the stairs.
__label__en	Tobias nudged Isabella to run outside.
__label__en	Tobias ran next door and asked the old lady living there to call the cops for him.
__label__en	Tobias had a sleepover with his friend, Walid.
__label__en	There was a slight drizzle and occasional lightning that night.
__label__en	Tobias was up late.
__label__en	Tobias interrupted out game.
__label__en	Tobias couldn't see outside.
__label__en	Tobias opened the blinds.
__label__en	Tobias could slightly see outside.
__label__en	There was nothing but wet grass in all directions.
__label__en	Tobias came up to the front door.
__label__en	Tobias turned the TV back on.
__label__en	Tobias's blinds were open.
__label__en	Tobias was so absorbed in the game.
__label__en	Tobias heard a second set of knocks.
__label__en	With all the lights on, Tobias couldn't really see outside.
__label__en	Tobias was standing at the window.
__label__en	Tobias screamed at Isabella to get up.
__label__en	Tobias turned the backyard light on.
__label__en	The footprints faded away in the mud.
__label__en	We all went to sleep at five am.
__label__en	The blinds were shut.
__label__en	Tobias heard a third set of knocks at exactly five am.
__label__en	Tobias ran outside alone.
__label__en	Tobias returned soaking wet.
__label__en	Tobias never slept over at Isabella's house again.
__label__en	Tobias used to be close friends with a kid named Walid.
__label__en	Tobias moved away across the state in 2004.
__label__en	There was nothing but woods in all directions.
__label__en	Tobias and Isabella talked and watched a movie.
__label__en	Do you have a basement?
__label__en	Tobias has been hearing weird noises coming from down there.
__label__en	The next day was partly cloudy and warm.
__label__en	Tobias went for a walk in the woods just to explore.
__label__en	Tobias was walking over to the shed.
__label__en	Tobias didn't know about that cellar door.
__label__en	The rusty door turned on the hinges.
__label__en	Tobias didn't dare to step foot down there.
__label__en	Tobias heard metallic sounds in the tunnel.
__label__en	Tobias was shocked to see what Isabella had found.
__label__en	Tobias called a few of his buddies over to explore the area.
__label__en	Tobias was forced to stay in Isabella's room.
__label__en	Tobias finally texted Isabella.
__label__en	Tanina is not at home.
__label__en	Tobias found five full body bags in that basement.
__label__en	Tobias wasn't responsible for those dead bodies.
__label__en	It went differently than I expected.
__label__en	The new topographical data shows a more complex moon than previously thought, one bombarded by two distinct populations of asteroids or comets in its turbulent early history.
__label__en	The grand duchies of Germany were therefore separated from the Germanic Empire, and the Emperor of France was declared to be their protector.
__label__en	If we consider the many benefits that navigation contributes to commerce in general, and how much the prosperity of nations are indebted to its source, we must without hesitation declare seamen, a most respectable part of mankind; and if we reflect a moment, on the many hazards and perils they are exposed to on that precarious element, and the advantages we reap from their toil, the common feelings of human society, must awake and remind us, not only how much we are obliged as social members, even from a motive of self interest, to study their preservation, but as fellow creatures, how forcibly our duty calls us to give them every aid in our power, and to lighten the burthen of their many toils.
__label__en	Goran says HFCS contains more fructose, or fruit sugar, than other sweeteners, such as sucrose or table sugar.
__label__en	She stroked my hair.
__label__en	I have a lot of memory gaps.
__label__en	I vaguely remember what happened to me.
__label__en	There are several varieties of omelettes, each named after the ingredient prominent in the composition.
__label__en	Tears flowed down my face.
__label__en	I was awakened by a voice repeating my name.
__label__en	Suddenly everything resurfaced.
__label__en	Mineral-munching microbes could have found a hospitable environment in an ancient Martian lake, according to new research.

__label__en	Here you are, finally promoted to a post worthy of you.
__label__en	They're going to call the cook.
__label__en	He won't have nightmares.
__label__en	She's as tall as Tom.
__label__en	Tom and Marie would buy this house if they had any money.
__label__en	Working for free is out of the question.
__label__en	Sorry, I was intending on coming a little sooner than that, but I was going about my business and I lost track of time.
__label__en	Tom is going to France to study painting.
__label__en	I paid homage to him.
__label__en	I paid tribute to her.
__label__en	She's eating a little bit of chocolate cake.
__label__en	I don't know what they have.
__label__en	At seventy years old, she still has all her teeth.
__label__en	I never remember the funny stories people tell me.
__label__en	They went to buy a motorcycle.
__label__en	Do they speak Italian in Australia?
__label__en	What she's saying isn't true.

__label__en	The apartment above has some new tenants.
__label__en	The auction sale was a huge success for the business, with numerous interested buyers.
__label__en	I promise you that I'm not responsible for this.
__label__en	Tom has to do it with passion or not do it at all.
__label__en	He said he couldn't stand clowns.
__label__en	Let's suppose a suppository.
__label__en	I think that she deserves her reward.

__label__en	You were about to drown in the river.
__label__en	They saw him leave the bar drunk.

__label__en	I hurt my thumb real bad.
__label__en	How many Icelanders live in Germany, and how many Germans live in Iceland?
__label__en	Best not get close to that plant!
__label__en	She's afraid of the truth.
__label__en	The black dog is running in the meadow.
__label__en	We forgave him his little escapades.
__label__en	Do buses go here?
__label__en	We put up with his little bouts of mischief.
__label__en	They are as tall as Tom.
__label__en	Dan knows Czech and Russian and maintains being able to understand more or less all the other Slavic languages.
__label__en	They repared them.
__label__en	This movie is distracting.
__label__en	I contacted the family and went over to their house the next day.
__label__en	He's the only one who tried.
__label__en	Suddenly, my computer crashed.
__label__en	He is taking a bath in a lake.
__label__en	Do not trust cults!
__label__en	He's published two novels.
__label__en	The pun also works in French.
__label__en	They went to buy a shovel.
__label__en	Sometimes, criticism helps us grow. Sometimes not.
__label__en	We called your home.
__label__en	A thief suddenly springs out of the dark.
__label__en	Karaoke is a popular activity in Japan.
__label__en	No, infertility isn't hereditary.
__label__en	He's my flatmate.
__label__en	He seems very concentrated on his work.
__label__en	Now I'll leave you alone for a while.
__label__en	You idly listened to your friends chat.
__label__en	Ever since he lost his job, Tom has resorted to raiding the piggy bank to get by.
__label__en	I can't scratch my back.
__label__en	The children surrounded the old woman.
__label__en	When does the mailman come by?
__label__en	I'm here to make you into war machines.
__label__en	How many are you missing?
__label__en	She got up to her mischief again!
__label__en	What else do you want us to tell you?
__label__en	There are too many clouds to be able to gaze at the eclipse properly.
__label__en	Thomas has a head for business.
__label__en	Thomas is business-minded.
__label__en	I will say nothing more of that old king.
__label__en	Fighter pilots are equipped with an anti-g suit.
__label__en	I find him pretty funny.
__label__en	The doctor is waiting for the result of my tests.
__label__en	We'll have a nice chat later, shall we?
__label__en	You really blew it big time.
__label__en	Tom has a full set of grandparents.
__label__en	He has grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
__label__en	It’s been a while since I’ve felt so pampered.
__label__en	They told us you had an accident.
__label__en	The children showered me with questions.
__label__en	I felt myself slipping into the abyss of shame.
__label__en	You can't fix it, and neither can I, but we can together.
__label__en	I love sitting next to you and reading while you play games.
__label__en	I love cuddling with you.
__label__en	Tom doesn't want to call a doctor.
__label__en	In January 2023, the U.S. government's No Fly List was leaked by a trans Swiss hacker named maia arson crimew (sic).
__label__en	Do you remember that time our house almost burned down?
__label__en	I narrowly escaped death.
__label__en	Remember when we got lost in Boston?
__label__en	There are cats everywhere.
__label__en	I snapped my fingers.
__label__en	Yiddish is a scam by Big German to sell more German.
__label__en	My throat was bone-dry.
__label__en	Your face is covered in lipstick.
__label__en	There are no Christians in the Hebrew Bible.
__label__en	It all seems so absurd!
__label__en	It's all so absurd!
__label__en	That's because I've had my fingers burnt by a guy like you before.
__label__en	I almost got my fingers burnt.
__label__en	Tom had everything that he needed.
__label__en	Are you sure it wasn't an accident?
__label__en	My girlfriend is a better cook than me.
__label__en	Do you consider yourself a patriot?
__label__en	How could you trust him with your money?
__label__en	It took several takes.
__label__en	Tom is already downstairs waiting for you.
__label__en	These aren't my notebooks.
__label__en	I can lend you mine.
__label__en	How are they any better?
__label__en	I had nothing to complain about.
__label__en	An ambulance is on its way.
__label__en	He was wearing a pair of flip flops.
__label__en	Do you speak Lao?
__label__en	I had to follow his every request.
__label__en	Do you speak Mongolian?
__label__en	Do you speak Kyrgyz?
__label__en	Do you speak Tajik?
__label__en	Do you speak Uzbek?
__label__en	Eating mushrooms is the closest thing to eating meat.
__label__en	Do you speak Pashto?
__label__en	I ask your forgiveness from the bottom of my heart for what I've done.
__label__en	Do you speak Turkmen?
__label__en	The turkey is in the oven.
__label__en	Grab a shovel and start digging.
__label__en	I paused to drink some water.
__label__en	Sorry, sir, but this coupon is expired.
__label__en	What's wrong with this projector? It won't display anything.
__label__en	Heroes arise in troubled times.
__label__en	What have you got in your hands right now?
__label__en	No need to argue, there is nothing that only has bad effects and no benefits.
__label__en	These few examples are not enough.
__label__en	Blaming the world serves no purpose.
__label__en	I'm a woman in full possession of her mental faculties.
__label__en	I'm a fully healthy person.
__label__en	I have all the right credentials to succeed in life.
__label__en	I don't have the courage to inform him of what happened.
__label__en	Ian Nepomniachtchi, with the black pieces, won the second game of the match for the FIDE 2023 World Chess Championship, which is being held in Astana, Kazakhstan. He is therefore 1 point ahead of his opponent, Ding Liren (1.5 X 0.5).
__label__en	What you are saying here is serious.
__label__en	Mary could not imagine spending a year in Korea.
__label__en	That would solve all your problems.
__label__en	The first 24 hours are the hardest.
__label__en	What exactly does Tom want to know?
__label__en	What does Tom actually want to know?
__label__en	Do you consider yourself patriotic?
__label__en	Who knows who is who?
__label__en	Do you speak Armenian?
__label__en	Do you speak Syriac?
__label__en	Do you speak Somali?
__label__en	Do you speak Romansh?
__label__en	I speak Romansh.
__label__en	I speak Armenian.
__label__en	I speak Georgian.
__label__en	I speak Syriac.
__label__en	I speak Amharic.
__label__en	I speak Somali.
__label__en	I speak Nepali.
__label__en	I speak Maltese.
__label__en	I remembered the past.
__label__en	You remind me of my dad.
__label__en	I reminded you about the past.
__label__en	It is our interest to understand each others.
__label__en	Tobias came on Halloween.
__label__en	Tobias wanted to go exploring.
__label__en	Security of the parameter was also ramped up drastically.
__label__en	Tobias started to look for a way in.
__label__en	Tobias managed to stay under the radar.
__label__en	Tobias was determined to find a way in.
__label__en	Tobias had boots on.
__label__en	The window was too high.
__label__en	The wood was wet and apparently rotten.
__label__en	Tobias had his way in.
__label__en	Tobias was the shortest.
__label__en	Tobias squeezed into the hole.
__label__en	Tobias covered the window with the planks.
__label__en	Tobias brought five flashlights for us.
__label__en	Tobias planned on going to the top.
__label__en	Tobias went through the dead silent hallways.
__label__en	Tobias eventually found the stairs.
__label__en	There were five more floors.
__label__en	Tobias began his search.
__label__en	There was a huge bang on the wall.
__label__en	Tobias wasn't the only one in that buiding.
__label__en	Tobias went the opposite direction.
__label__en	Tobias was in the back.
__label__en	Tobias glanced behind him and saw Isabella.
__label__en	Tobias was the only one who noticed that.
__label__en	Tobias disappeared down the hall.
__label__en	Tobias disappeared down the other hall.
__label__en	Tobias stopped and looked back.
__label__en	The guy Tobias saw wasn't there.
__label__en	Tobias didn't know whether Isabella was joking or not.
__label__en	Tobias volunteered to go first.
__label__en	Tobias was OK with it.
__label__en	Tobias hid in what once was a bathroom.
__label__en	Tobias disappeared down the hall as Isabella called for him to wait.
__label__en	Tobias felt something grab the back of his shoe.
__label__en	Tobias was holding his flashlight.
__label__en	Tobias got lost in complete darkness.
__label__en	Tobias came rushing back.
__label__en	Tobias didn't try to go down there.
__label__en	Tobias force Isabella to come with him.
__label__en	Tobias forgot how he got in.
__label__en	Tobias never plays jokes like that.
__label__en	Tobias was navigating a maze down that huge basement.
__label__en	Tobias was the first to see that man.
__label__en	Tobias was hiding half his body behind the wall.
__label__en	Tobias could see that Isabella was wearing a mask.
__label__en	Tobias turned the other way and ran.
__label__en	Most of the commotion going on outside was gone.
__label__en	Tobias got busted.
__label__en	Tobias ran back through the woods to his truck.
__label__en	Tobias's parents let him go trick-or-treating without them for the first time ever.
__label__en	Properties are so big in this area.
__label__en	Tobias rang the bell as usual.
__label__en	Tobias remembers that quite clearly.
__label__en	Tobias had thin graying hair and a moustache.
__label__en	Tobias seemed surprised that Isabella's parents weren't with her.
__label__en	Tobias's room looked cool.
__label__en	Tobias needs to make it through the obstacle course.
__label__en	Tobias told Isabella to come in.
__label__en	Tobias slowly shut the door.
__label__en	Tobias followed after Isabella.
__label__en	Tobias opened a door, revealing stairs to the basement.
__label__en	Tobias started making his way down the stairs.
__label__en	The behind Tobias door slammed shut.
__label__en	Tobias listened by the basement door to hear anything.
__label__en	There was a commotion outside the basement.
__label__en	Tobias hugged Isabella and told her to follow him out of the house.
__label__en	Halloween was my least favorite holiday.
__label__en	Tobias's property is big, but it doesn't have any fences.
__label__en	Tobias was in his yard.
__label__en	Tobias lived in a teepee.
__label__en	Tobias got another ring from the doorbell.
__label__en	Tobias opened the door to a guy in a full-body gorilla costume.
__label__en	Tobias looked scary.
__label__en	Tobias had a lot of candy left.
__label__en	Tobias didn't speak any words to Isabella.
__label__en	Tobias stood on Isabella's stoep.
__label__en	Tobias walked up to Isabella.
__label__en	Tobias didn't shake his head.
__label__en	Tobias kept looking at Isabella weirdly.
__label__en	Tobias wasn't in the mood to play games.
__label__en	What Tobias was doing was extremely unsettling.
__label__en	Tobias got back up and looked through the window.
__label__en	Tobias went out to investigate.
__label__en	Tobias left the rake up.
__label__en	The rake shouldn't have fallen on its own.
__label__en	Tobias remembered leaving the rake up.
__label__en	The rake fell.
__label__en	Tobias wasn't expecting to find Isabella sitting on his bed.
__label__en	Tobias walked into the shed.
__label__en	Tobias saw Isabella in the corner.
__label__en	Tobias had his mask off.
__label__en	Tobias was facing the wall.
__label__en	Tobias stood motionless.
__label__en	Tobias hasn't heard Isabella.
__label__en	Tobias hasn't seen Isabella.
__label__en	It nearly made me shit myself.
__label__en	Tobias ran back to the house.
__label__en	Tobias walked inside and locked the door.
__label__en	The guy in the gorilla suit was gone.
__label__en	Tobias wanted to take a selfie with the guy in the gorilla suit.
__label__en	Tobias left his room to see where his German Shepherd was.
__label__en	Tobias's German Shepherd was barking ferociously.
__label__en	Tobias brought his German Shepherd to sleep with him in his room.
__label__en	Tobias's German Shepherd was barking like crazy.
__label__en	Tobias told his German Shepherd to stop barking.
__label__en	Tobias yelled at his German Shepherd to stop barking.
__label__en	Tobias was dressed as a Super Mario character.
__label__en	Tobias is freakishly tall and skinny.
__label__en	Tobias lives in a very congested suburban neighborhood.
__label__en	Tobias and Isabella have been trick-or-treating for hours.
__label__en	Tobias's bag was completely full.
__label__en	Tobias planned on continuing to trick-or-treat until his bag was completely full.
__label__en	We all looked at the window.
__label__en	Tobias couldn't see anyone.
__label__en	Tobias was in his late thirties and was already balding.
__label__en	They are happy to be hungry. God willing, they won't leave.
__label__en	Tobias just dodged a ball by not asking those guys to help him.
__label__en	Tobias continued on with his business.
__label__en	There weren't many houses around us.
__label__en	Tobias stopped walking and turned around to see what was up.
__label__en	Tobias ws searching the woods for Isabella.
__label__en	Tobias assumed he was being followed.
__label__en	Tobias nudged Isabella forward.
__label__en	Tobias stopped and the sound of footsteps behind him stopped as well.
__label__en	The sound of footsteps triggered a fight-or-flight response in all of us.
__label__en	We all ran for it.
__label__en	Tobias ran down the dark street.
__label__en	Tobias ran straight for Isabella's backyard and hid there.
__label__en	We all hid together.
__label__en	Tobias heard the backyard gate slam shut.
__label__en	Tobias went down armed with a knife to face the intruder.
__label__en	The front door opened.
__label__en	Tobias came rushing downstairs.
__label__en	Tobias screamed like an animal.
__label__en	Tobias decided to call it a night.
__label__en	Tobias got a disturbing text message from Isabella.
__label__en	Tobias responded back quickly.
__label__en	It wasn't Tobias in the backyard.
__label__en	Tobias never went in the backyard.
__label__en	Tobias immediately checked the backyard from his upper deck.
__label__en	Tobias invited us in.
__label__en	Tobias had already called the cops.
__label__en	Tobias used to chaperon his little brothers while they trick-and-treated.
__label__en	Tobias had better things to do.
__label__en	Tobias was a bit old to be actually collecting candy himself.
__label__en	Tobias's pastic bag was full.
__label__en	Tobias insisted on filling his bag to the top.
__label__en	Tobias started leaving Isabella to the direction of John's house.
__label__en	Tobias has got to get those kids home.
__label__en	Tobias fixed his passenger seat into an upright position.
__label__en	Tobias began fidgeting with the passenger seat.
__label__en	Tobias heard the kids screaming outside.
__label__en	Tobias was trying to grab one of the kids.
__label__en	Tobias grabbed Isabella by the throat and began to strangle her.
__label__en	Tobias fired a warning shot.
__label__en	Tobias fired a shot in the air.
__label__en	There was a report of a missing fourteen-year-old boy in our town.
__label__en	Tobias was trick-or-treating on Halloween night.
__label__en	Halloween is quite different when you live in a quiet and isolated area.
__label__en	There are less trick-or-treaters this year.
__label__en	Halloween feels a lot spookier in a rural area.
__label__en	Our town is a perfect place for trick-or-treating.
__label__en	The woman who answered the door was very friendly and gave us a generous amount of candy.
__label__en	The bowl was empty.
__label__en	There was an arrow pointing to the backyard.
__label__en	Tobias had no choice but to follow Isabella.
__label__en	A candle sat in the middle of the basement.
__label__en	Tobias still remembers that stupid riddle to this day.
__label__en	It seemed to suspicious.
__label__en	Tobias was weirded out a bit, too.
__label__en	Tobias lived in a boring town.
__label__en	Tobias hid in a small wooden shed in the backyard.
__label__en	Tobias tried leading Isabella closer to the woods.
__label__en	Tobias was looking for candy in Isabella's room.
__label__en	Tobias started to examine the place.
__label__en	Tobias's house had a dirty look to it.
__label__en	Tobias look at the upstairs window.
__label__en	When Tobias noticed Isabella, he moved away from the window and shut the blinds.
__label__en	Tobias was frozen still.
__label__en	Tobias was looking at the woods.
__label__en	Tobias came out of the woods.
__label__en	Tobias came into light.
__label__en	Tobias was wearing a horrific mask.
__label__en	Tobias was holding a machete.
__label__en	Tobias still thought it was a joke.
__label__en	Tobias charged at Isabella, swung the machete, but missed.
__label__en	Tobias made it back to his house.
__label__en	Tobias ran so much.
__label__en	Tobias told his parents right away.
__label__en	Tobias drove Isabella to that house.
__label__en	Tobias's house has been vacant for months.
__label__en	No one was living in that house.
__label__en	Tobias was spying on Isabella from upstairs.
__label__en	The cops will investigate further into this.
__label__en	Tobias doesn't realize what sick this world is.
__label__en	Alberto took his youngest sister trick-or-treating.
__label__en	Alberto didn't have plans anyways.
__label__en	Alberto was more than a mile away from his house.
__label__en	Alberto was approaching the front door.
__label__en	Alberto just knocked on the door.
__label__en	Alberto pounded on the door.
__label__en	Alberto was walking down the stoep.
__label__en	Alberto poked his head out to see who was knocking on the window.
__label__en	We simultaneously yelled: "Trick-or-treat!"
__label__en	Alberto just stood there on the stoep.
__label__en	Alberto waved the kids to come into the house with his hand.
__label__en	Alberto yelled to the kids to come back.
__label__en	Alberto shut the door, almost slamming it in Isabella's face.
__label__en	Alberto kept his eyes on Isabella's house.
__label__en	Alberto was sitting by the window.
__label__en	Alberto continued walking home.
__label__en	Alberto came inside to get the candy.
__label__en	Alberto wanted to see what his parents had to say first.
__label__en	Alberto was standing by the corner of the house.
__label__en	Alberto and Isabella had a long conversation about that.
__label__en	Alberto's house has been vacant for months.
__label__en	Alberto was a sexual predator.
__label__en	Alberto was waiting to lure Isabella into that apartment.
__label__en	Halloween can be a very dangerous holiday for kids.
__label__en	Alberto was home on Halloween.
__label__en	Alberto was out, partying.
__label__en	Alberto was doing homework.
__label__en	Alberto really needed to get that homework done.
__label__en	It's not worth my time.
__label__en	Alberto came over, asking for help.
__label__en	Alberto worked hard on his Halloween costume.
__label__en	Alberto was playing his PS4.
__label__en	Alberto heard a knock on the door.
__label__en	It's pretty late for trick-or-treaters to be still out.
__label__en	Alberto locked the door behind him.
__label__en	Alberto did the same thing.
__label__en	Alberto was at least six feet tall.
__label__en	Alberto wore a pretty expensive Halloween constume.
__label__en	Alberto didn't do a thing but stare at Isabella.
__label__en	Alberto stood there like a statue.
__label__en	Alberto is pretty small for a guy.
__label__en	Alberto began to feel intimidated.
__label__en	Alberto handed Isabella candy.
__label__en	Alberto started getting really uncomfortable.
__label__en	Alberto doesn't walk into people's houses without permission.
__label__en	Alberto wasn't there to trick-or-treat.
__label__en	Alberto reached into his pocket and pulled something out.
__label__en	Alberto was holding a weapon.
__label__en	Alberto blocked the only exit.
__label__en	Alberto was completely unable to move.
__label__en	Alberto felt like he was dreaming the entire thing.
__label__en	Alberto was dressed up as Michael Myers on Halloween.
__label__en	Alberto was still frozen in shock.
__label__en	Alberto was completely confused.
__label__en	Alberto put the knife back in his pocket.
__label__en	Alberto gave Isabella the candy.
__label__en	Alberto decided to prank Isabella.
__label__en	Alberto owns a tattoo place.
__label__en	We should hang out some time.
__label__en	Alberto took Isabella's name and number down.
__label__en	Alberto agreed to everything Isabella said.
__label__en	The conversation seemed to go on for hours.
__label__en	Alberto got vibes that Isabella was a dangerous person.
__label__en	Alberto turned around to leave Isabella's house.
__label__en	Alberto decided to not contact the cops.
__label__en	Alberto still has Isabella's number to this day.
__label__en	Alberto never called or texted Isabella.
__label__en	Just be careful on who you open your door for on Halloween.
__label__en	Nothing could have stopped Alberto from stabbing Isabella.
__label__en	Halloween used to be my favorite holiday.
__label__en	Alberto likes Christmas the most.
__label__en	Alberto and Isabella went trick-or-treating together.
__label__en	Alberto wanted to be back by ten o'clock the latest.
__label__en	Alberto wanted to get as much candy as possible.
__label__en	It started to drizzle.
__label__en	Alberto's old mansion was nicknamed "Hell House."
__label__en	Alberto's website is down now.
__label__en	Alberto didn't live very close to Isabella's house.
__label__en	Alberto was feeling brave and cocky.
__label__en	The drizzle turned to rain.
__label__en	Alberto walked home in the rain.
__label__en	It sounded like it came from upstairs.
__label__en	Alberto doesn't remember the full details.
__label__en	Alberto felt like his heart dropped from his chest when he saw that man holding a knife.
__label__en	Alberto ran away from the window.
__label__en	Alberto was coming outside after the kids.
__label__en	The fence was made of wood.
__label__en	The fence started to shake a little.
__label__en	The entire fence started to shake.
__label__en	Alberto saw something at the edge of the fence.
__label__en	Alberto leaned over to our side of the fence.
__label__en	Alberto dropped his candy bag and ran for it.
__label__en	Alberto got back to his house.
__label__en	This would probably get Alberto in trouble.
__label__en	Alberto knew who lived in that house.
__label__en	Alberto never saw a car in that house's driveway.
__label__en	Alberto told all the neighbors his story.
__label__en	Alberto has never had to worry about that.
__label__en	Alberto knew that something strange was going on inside of that house.
__label__en	My second primary school teacher (1941) was a beautiful blonde named Helena.
__label__en	Alberto was trick-or-treating downtown.
__label__en	Things really started to die down.
__label__en	Alberto called it quits with the trick-or-treating and walked back home.
__label__en	Alberto walked really, really slowly.
__label__en	Alberto wore a scary Halloween costume.
__label__en	Alberto went to a park that was nearby.
__label__en	Alberto wrote obcenities on the wall of the bathroom.
__label__en	Alberto was holding some kind of spear-like object.
__label__en	Alberto got closer and closer.
__label__en	Alberto started to charge us and we all ran in different directions.
__label__en	Alberto didn't know how to get back to Isabella's house.
__label__en	Alberto was on his way over.
__label__en	Alberto picked up on the first ring.
__label__en	Alberto told Isabella to meet him at Walid's house.
__label__en	Alberto had a good laugh about it.
__label__en	Alberto and Isabella hung out in the living room for a while.
__label__en	Alberto looked out the window, then ducked.
__label__en	Alberto was standing outside of Isabella's house.
__label__en	Alberto told Isabella that Walid wasn't lying.
__label__en	Alberto shut off the TV and went upstairs to sleep.
__label__en	Alberto never saw Isabella again.
__label__en	Alberto found a rubber clown nose on the porch.
__label__en	Halloween was on Thursday.
__label__en	Alberto forced Isabella to answer the door.
__label__en	There were almost no trick-or-treaters that Halloween.
__label__en	Alberto gave the trick-or-treaters some candy.
__label__en	I made them cry.
__label__en	Alberto was always kind of sad.
__label__en	Alberto walked away without saying thanks.
__label__en	Alberto sat back down on the couch.
__label__en	The TV flipped from one channel to the other.
__label__en	Alberto turned the volume on the TV all the way down and listened.
__label__en	Alberto started to feel sick inside.
__label__en	Alberto forgot to lock the front door.
__label__en	Alberto was afraid to go down there.
__label__en	Alberto kept the TV on, but muted.
__label__en	Alberto asked his parents to come home.
__label__en	Alberto was scared that someone was downstairs.
__label__en	Alberto froze on the couch.
__label__en	Alberto couldn't move a muscle.
__label__en	When Alberto saw Isabella, he went the other way.
__label__en	Alberto cut his trip short and came home.
__label__en	Alberto felt safe to leave his house.
__label__en	The moral of the story simply comes down to keeping your doors locked.
__label__en	Alberto was having a Halloween party.
__label__en	Alberto's parents weren't home all weekend.
__label__en	Alberto didn't want Isabella in the house during the party.
__label__en	Alberto wanted to make it a good time.
__label__en	Alberto had an abundant supply of candy.
__label__en	Alberto wasn't satisfied yet.
__label__en	Alberto rested at Isabella's place for a while.
__label__en	Alberto didn't answer his door.
__label__en	Alberto didn't get much candy this Halloween.
__label__en	Alberto and Isabella agreed they will be skipping school the next day.
__label__en	Alberto and Isabella divorced after their child died.
__label__en	Alberto's house hasn't been sold.
__label__en	The house was very scary in the dark.
__label__en	An old fence surrounded the front yard.
__label__en	Alberto hoped no neighbors would see him.
__label__en	The windows were boarded up from the inside.
__label__en	Alberto was able to lift the table.
__label__en	Alberto was inside the abandoned house.
__label__en	All of us had their flashlights.
__label__en	Everything in the abandoned house seemed to have been untouched for years.
__label__en	The abandoned house seemed clear of anything interesting.
__label__en	The kitchen smelt foul.
__label__en	Alberto was standing in one of the corners.
__label__en	There was a giant hole in the ceiling.
__label__en	Alberto shut his flashlight.
__label__en	Alberto whispered very lightly.
__label__en	Alberto started tiptoeing to the back door.
__label__en	Alberto didn't follow Isabella.
__label__en	Alberto had to wait for Isabella in the living room.
__label__en	Alberto was looking down through that hole.
__label__en	Alberto didn't want to get any louder.
__label__en	Alberto turned on his flashlight.
__label__en	Alberto saw Isabella walking down the stairs.
__label__en	Alberto shined his light into that hole.
__label__en	Alberto smelt something foul upstairs.
__label__en	Alberto found a rotting carcass in the basement.
__label__en	Alberto doesn't go there anymore.
__label__en	Alberto learnt to code.
__label__en	Alberto had all the blinds shut.
__label__en	The lights turned on outside.
__label__en	Alberto lowered the volume on the TV.
__label__en	Alberto saw a raccoon in the backyard.
__label__en	Alberto went back to watching TV.
__label__en	Alberto heard a bucket fall over outside.
__label__en	A raccoon was in the shed.
__label__en	Alberto saw somebody standing at the door.
__label__en	The remote was in the middle of the coffee table.
__label__en	Alberto doesn't know how to describe that.
__label__en	Alberto started knocking aggressively on the window.
__label__en	Alberto screamed in a shaky voice.
__label__en	The woman had grey wiry hair.
__label__en	Alberto was screaming as if he was mentally ill.
__label__en	Alberto was attempting to break into Isabella's house.
__label__en	Alberto waited in the shed until the police arrived.
__label__en	Alberto opened the bathroom door.
__label__en	Alberto slowly and quietly opened the front door.
__label__en	Alberto came rushing over to the door.
__label__en	Alberto slammed the door shut again.
__label__en	Alberto was saying things under his breath and Isabella couldn't make out any of it.
__label__en	Alberto opened the bathroom window and screamed for help.
__label__en	The knocking on the door stopped.
__label__en	Alberto stepped away from the door.
__label__en	Alberto did it pretty easily.
__label__en	Alberto looked at Isabella with a look of crazy in his eyes. She looked away.
__label__en	Alberto was taken to some kind of special care place.
__label__en	Alberto lost the lawsuit.
__label__en	Alberto was taken to some kind of treatment center.
__label__en	Alberto was put in some kind of treatment center.
__label__en	Alberto was out of the neighborhood for years.
__label__en	Alberto has never spoken to his neighbor.
__label__en	Alberto went skiing, too.
__label__en	Alberto walked up to the front door.
__label__en	Alberto figured Isabella had kids.
__label__en	Alberto turned on the water.
__label__en	Alberto slept like a baby.
__label__en	Alberto changed into his skiing gear.
__label__en	The car belongs to the neighbors.
__label__en	Alberto took the ball and threw it over the fence separating his property from Isabella's.
__label__en	Alberto threw that blue ball over the fence.
__label__en	The kids were playing outside.
__label__en	Alberto couldn't see any kids.
__label__en	Alberto brought the ball inside his house.
__label__en	Alberto went skiing again.
__label__en	Alberto seemed completely innocent.
__label__en	The ball was on our lawn.
__label__en	Alberto got chills again.
__label__en	Alberto thanked Isabella and shook her hand.
__label__en	Alberto threw all his stuff on the couch.
__label__en	Alberto crashed into the bed.
__label__en	Alberto's whole body was sore.
__label__en	Alberto woke up to kids' laughter in the middle of the night.
__label__en	Alberto was sitting in the snow.
__label__en	Alberto suddenly didn't feel alone in the house.
__label__en	Alberto threw everything in the back so he would be ready to go.
__label__en	Alberto left the lights back and went back to his room.
__label__en	Alberto turned every light in the house on.
__label__en	Alberto closed the blinds to every window in his house.
__label__en	Alberto's exhaustion overcame his fear and he fell asleep.
__label__en	Alberto sped the hell away from that abandoned gas station.
__label__en	Alberto and Isabella met through work.
__label__en	Recently, Alberto has got a new neighbor.
__label__en	Alberto didn't even know if his neighbor was a man or a woman.
__label__en	Alberto was home. His car was in the driveway.
__label__en	Alberto was walking down the driveway.
__label__en	Alberto was staring through the window like a creep.
__label__en	Alberto seemed awkward and creepy.
__label__en	Alberto heard noises coming from outside.
__label__en	Alberto's room is upstairs.
__label__en	Alberto was a big-looking guy.
__label__en	Alberto was sawing a big piece of wood.
__label__en	Alberto was already awake from the noise.
__label__en	Alberto agreed to go over and ask Isabella politely to turn the music down.
__label__en	Alberto decided to go back to sleep.
__label__en	Alberto heard noises in the middle of the night again.
__label__en	The screaming seemed to be coming from inside Alberto's house.
__label__en	Alberto moved away from the window.
__label__en	Alberto was already awake from the noises.
__label__en	Alberto stood there the whole time, listening.
__label__en	Alberto stayed on the phone with the cops.
__label__en	Alberto looked down the stairs and listened.
__label__en	Alberto came through the back door.
__label__en	There was no lock on Alberto's door.
__label__en	Alberto heard footsteps coming up the stairs fast.
__label__en	Alberto tried pushing the door open.
__label__en	Alberto tried to ram the door.
__label__en	Alberto heard Isabella go downstairs.
__label__en	Alberto decided to open the door and peek outside.
__label__en	Alberto talked in a deep, commanding voice.
__label__en	Alberto ran back upstairs with Isabella.
__label__en	Alberto was banging on the door.
__label__en	"Police!" "Up here! Up here!"
__label__en	The cops put Alberto in the back seat.
__label__en	The cops went in with guns drawn.
__label__en	Alberto was crying hysterically.
__label__en	Alberto was screaming as loud as he could.
__label__en	Alberto never said who the dead body was.
__label__en	Alberto took a road trip to the Blida Atlas.
__label__en	Alberto took a trip to the Blida Atlas.
__label__en	It worked seamlesly.
__label__en	The house had that distinct smell that reminded us of a country log cabin.
__label__en	Alberto didn't know why the door would be locked.
__label__en	Alberto left the bedroom nice and neat.
__label__en	Alberto walked around the village for a little bit.
__label__en	The next day was a cloudy chilly one.
__label__en	Alberto returned to the bungalow.
__label__en	Upon returning to the bungalow, Alberto showered and got ready for dinner.
__label__en	Alberto put his ear up to the door to listen.
__label__en	Alberto knocked on the door to see if someone was in there.
__label__en	Alberto sat there, watching whatever he could find on the TV.
__label__en	Alberto wasn't sure why Isabella would have locked that door.
__label__en	Alberto went out for lunch after the shower.
__label__en	Alberto went to a restaurant called "Tala."
__label__en	Alberto offered to come by and unlock the door.
__label__en	Alberto collapsed on the couch.
__label__en	Alberto doesn't know why he didn't think of doing that sooner.
__label__en	Alberto was dancing slowly in the center of the room.
__label__en	Alberto stopped and looked at Isabella, smiling.
__label__en	Alberto met Isabella at the house, panicked and confused.
__label__en	Alberto got a call back from Isabella, telling him that police were on the way.
__label__en	Alberto didn't stay there after that.
__label__en	Alberto couldn't sleep for nights.
__label__en	Alberto was in there the entire time Isabella was.
__label__en	It was a rainy April.
__label__en	Alberto came straight from work and was pretty exhausted.
__label__en	There was a decent number of people there.
__label__en	Alberto wanted to just go home and go to bed.
__label__en	Alberto shouldn't have driven home with alcohol in his system.
__label__en	Alberto just wanted peace and quiet.
__label__en	Alberto was driving down a quiet residential road.
__label__en	Alberto rolled down his window and asked Isabella if she wanted a ride.
__label__en	Alberto stopped to the stop sign.
__label__en	Alberto asked Isabella why she was out in the rain.
__label__en	Alberto made a joke about that.
__label__en	Alberto thanked Isabella for picking him up.
__label__en	Alberto passed the dead end sign.
__label__en	Alberto wasn't in the back seat.
__label__en	Alberto checked the entire vehicle.
__label__en	There was no one insight.
__label__en	Alberto snuck out of the truck unheard.
__label__en	Alberto was in the rain.
__label__en	Alberto stood there in the rain, dumbfounded.
__label__en	Alberto asked Isabella where she was going.
__label__en	The cemetery was at the end of the road.
__label__en	Alberto did a three-point turn and drove back home.
__label__en	Alberto always goes hunting in April.
__label__en	Alberto joined in in the conversation.
__label__en	Alberto had to close for the night.
__label__en	There were Halloween decorations everywhere.
__label__en	Alberto and Isabella decided to split up.
__label__en	Alberto was in a Halloween costume.
__label__en	The colonization of Palestine is doomed to fail.
__label__en	The al-Aqsa Mosque can't be destroyed and the colonization of Palestine has no future whatsoever.
__label__en	Palestinians need protection.
__label__en	Are you happy with your social life?
__label__en	He has a hangdog face.
__label__en	My friends are in the front seats.
__label__en	My first teacher was called Iracema. Iracema is also the name of one of my sisters.
__label__en	Israeli police stormed the al-Aqsa Mosque and savagely beat Muslim worshippers inside the prayer hall.
__label__en	She sat with me.
__label__en	Israeli police raided the al-Aqsa Mosque and savagely bear Muslim worshippers, preventing them from staying there overnight.
__label__en	Israel has no respect whatsoever to the sanctity of the al-Aqsa Mosque.
__label__en	I'll talk it over with her.
__label__en	She sat on me.
__label__en	Israel does everything it can to label the indigenous Palestinians as nothing more than "terrorists."
__label__en	Palestinians are not terrorists and have the absolute legitimate right to defend their land including by the use of force.
__label__en	We'll put him to bed, then we'll talk.
__label__en	Israel must be held accountable for its crimes in the Palestinian occupied territories.
__label__en	Palestinians have the right to resist Israel's illegal occupation of their lands.
__label__en	Tensions are mounting on the al-Aqsa Mosque compound.
__label__en	You're here now and that's all that matters.
__label__en	That's a very good bet.
__label__en	I won that bet.
__label__en	I bet you can't do that.
__label__en	I bet we'll see Tom there.
__label__en	Tom knows how to bet.
__label__en	I bet Tom doesn't get here on time.
__label__en	I bet Tom doesn't make it.
__label__en	I bet Tom couldn't do that.
__label__en	We'll talk the matter over again a little later .
__label__en	You can bet your life on that.
__label__en	Even after a single glass of champagne I have found that the slight mental exaltation is accompanied by a slight obfuscation.
__label__en	Tom could do that, I bet.
__label__en	I bet Tom didn't like that.
__label__en	I bet Tom didn't expect that to happen.
__label__en	I bet Tom is none too pleased.
__label__en	I bet Tom isn't telling the truth.
__label__en	I bet Tom is younger than Mary.
__label__en	I bet Tom doesn't know anything.
__label__en	I bet Tom will be more careful next time.
__label__en	I bet Tom will never try that again.
__label__en	Jewish extremists are trying to ignite the situation in the al-Aqsa Mosque.
__label__en	He sat behind me.
__label__en	I bet Tom wasn't telling the truth.
__label__en	I can see that you're a good-hearted lad.
__label__en	Jewish extremists are allowed to pray at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound and this is a true timebomb.
__label__en	I bet Tom didn't ask anyone for help.
__label__en	My bet is that Tom will get the job.
__label__en	My bet is that Tom will get fired.
__label__en	Zionist extremists are allowed to pray at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound and this is a real timebomb waiting to explode.
__label__en	Zionist extremists want to change the status quo of the al-Aqsa Mosque.
__label__en	I'll come soon, and we'll talk of the old times.
__label__en	I'll bet Tom wasn't able to do that.
__label__en	She sat in front of me.
__label__en	I bet on the wrong horse.
__label__en	Well, we'll see what we can do for you.
__label__en	The situation in East Jerusalem is extremely volatile.
__label__en	"At the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Glasgow [Scotland] last year, all countries agreed to revisit and strengthen their climate plans," Simon Stiell, executive secretary of U.N. Climate Change, said in a statement released to the media.
__label__en	Muslim worshippers were savagely attacked and beaten by Israeli police inside the al-Aqsa Mosque.
__label__en	I have to go, but I'll talk to you soon!
__label__en	I bet Tom didn't tell Mary that.
__label__en	Zionist extremists are trying to ignite the situation in East Jerusalem.
__label__en	I bet I know what you're thinking.
__label__en	I bet Tom is doing that right now.
__label__en	Thank you once again!
__label__en	I bet you're surprised to see me.
__label__en	I bet you thirty dollars that Tom won't come.
__label__en	Tom bet Mary thirty dollars that I wouldn't do this.
__label__en	I bet Tom wasn't the only one who thought that.
__label__en	I'll bet Tom never comes here again.
__label__en	He insisted on giving him some money.
__label__en	Palestinians don't have to pay for the Holocaust.
__label__en	They sat with us a bit.
__label__en	I bet Tom won't do that again.
__label__en	I bet Tom will be the first one to show up.
__label__en	I bet Tom will be the first one to get here.
__label__en	My first experiments were failures and I was discouraged because, instead of saving food, I was wasting it, and yet I was unwilling to acknowledge myself defeated by the little square of leaven that came to me so attractively done up in tinfoil.
__label__en	I bet that doesn't happen.
__label__en	They left the house.
__label__en	I bet you could get Tom to do that if you tried.
__label__en	Jews are normally forbidden from praying at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound.
__label__en	He has a very laid back character.
__label__en	The Zionist extremists who pray at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound are doing so to "lay claim" to that compound.
__label__en	It is important to separate Zionism from Judaism.
__label__en	She sat between us.
__label__en	He was warmly welcomed.
__label__en	Maybe we can find a new way to do that.
__label__en	Tom was too tired to walk any farther.
__label__en	Things have gotten very complicated.
__label__en	Things have become very complicated.
__label__en	We still have many unsolved cases.
__label__en	We still have a number of unsolved cases.
__label__en	I won't be able to fix this problem without some help.
__label__en	One of the first things I did was to phone my parents.
__label__en	He sat between us.
__label__en	She sat between them.
__label__en	I want to go back to school and finish it out.
__label__en	Alberto was trying to mask his voice.
__label__en	Alberto spoke in a deep raspy voice.
__label__en	For such an important election, many voters complain there has been too little solid information to make a decision and too much scaremongering, and grandstanding by both sides.
__label__en	Alberto repeated himself over and over, saying: "Take this bag!"
__label__en	Take this bag or I'll take you.
__label__en	Alberto took the pumpkin from Isabella.
__label__en	Alberto asked Isabella why she was holding a pumpkin.
__label__en	Well, I'll have a look at my diary.
__label__en	Alberto stole a huge pumpkin from Isabella's farm.
__label__en	Alberto walked to that direction, not saying anything.
__label__en	The pumpkin was carved on the inside.
__label__en	Alberto found a key in the bottom of the inside of the pumpkin.
__label__en	Alberto found a severed human finger on the ground.
__label__en	Alberto ran to the nearest hospital.
__label__en	Alberto stayed on the premises while the police search the place.
__label__en	I'll definitely be home tonight.
__label__en	Alberto had a traumatizing experience that night.
__label__en	No one left at home.
__label__en	Nobody left at home.
__label__en	You reminded me of my grandfather.
__label__en	From the nature of my subject it was inevitable that the book should be full of technicalities, figures, and statistics, but it has been my endeavour to render the technicalities intelligible, and to prevent the significance of the statistics being obscured by an excess of detail.
__label__en	Only few days left for me to take some holidays.
__label__en	You can see me, but myself I cannot see you!
__label__en	The rivers are dried out.
__label__en	There is no more water in the rivers.
__label__en	We feel like we do not exist.
__label__en	All panhandlers ask for dimes—but this one had a very special purpose!
__label__en	The most remarkable objects on the eastern side are the temples of Karnak and Luxor; and on the western side are the Memnonium or palace of Memnon, two colossal statues, the sepulchres of the kings, and the temple of Medinet Habu.
__label__en	He sang his gayest songs and leaped so lightly in the air, there seemed to be a thousand harlequins, and little Beppo followed lightly after.
__label__en	In America, anyone can make it by pulling themselves up by their bootstraps.
__label__en	They were sisters, the four teachers I had in primary school, in the years 1940 (Iracema), 1941 (Helena), 1942 (Corália) and 1943 (Miriam).
__label__en	Ghosts are not as scary as some flesh and blood people.
__label__en	You know how impetuous our friend is ordinarily, what a soul of restlessness and energy, never content unless he is rushing at some object, like a sportive bull at a red shawl; but amiable withal.
__label__en	Everyone who wanted to spend the night here was scared to death, because this place is haunted.
__label__en	This got some scientists to thinking about ways to keep our very expensive robotic probes from getting sidelined by something as inconsequential as a sand trap.
__label__en	I like your gumption, kid.
__label__en	Tom needed me to help him.
__label__en	These long legal documents befuddle me.
__label__en	"This smells fishy to me," I said to him.
__label__en	Spiders eat insects.
__label__en	No law enacted by the legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall contravene this Law.
__label__en	Next year I'll finish my studies.
__label__en	We'll talk again when you guys get back.
__label__en	Well, I'd better get going.
__label__en	He kept a detailed diary.
__label__en	This is a good place to meet .
__label__en	"The atheist," they called him; "the little atheist."
__label__en	I hope you can speak to him for me. Is there a problem?
__label__en	I went to school for the first time when I was seven years old. And I keep studying to this day because I still have a lot to learn.
__label__en	You can see infrared, can't you?
__label__en	Quarrelling won't do any good.
__label__en	"Your money or your life".
__label__en	Don't beg. Fight like a man.
__label__en	I feel like I don't even know her anymore.
__label__en	I really resent her for the situation.
__label__en	Tom literally threw John under the bus.
__label__en	Updates are ready to install.
__label__en	I'm sorry to have dragged you into the mess.
__label__en	We don't think that way anymore.
__label__en	Being a family is what we're trying to accomplish.
__label__en	Do you speak Malay?
__label__en	I had very little certainty in my life.
__label__en	On the outside I tried to look very serious.
__label__en	Dad, you don't understand.
__label__en	Don't worry, I'm not dead yet.
__label__en	It really got stuck in my head.
__label__en	I don't want her to make the wrong decision because of me.
__label__en	Do you speak Malagasy?
__label__en	I've stayed quietly in my corner doing my stuff.
__label__en	I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
__label__en	Do you speak Sakha?
__label__en	I don't want you to touch me.
__label__en	Do you speak Yakut?
__label__en	Do you speak Yakutian?
__label__en	I don't mean to rush things.
__label__en	Don't piss outside the bowl.
__label__en	Your uncle will take care of everything.
__label__en	On the 9th of April of 2023, my family went out for dim sum lunch in the elegant Fisherman's Terrace Seafood Restaurant in the very fancy Aberdeen Centre, here on Lulu Island. I do not often have dim sum, and this time, I really had a nice time. My family knew that I have been dreaming of a spacious atrium-like venue, and this time, there it was. After the beautiful meal, we headed to the Japanese-lifestyle boutique called Oomomo. I wanted to get a bottle of authentic Japanese "mugicha," or barley tea, but I could not think too much of more food, just then.
__label__en	When I opened the box, it was empty.
__label__en	Everything will be fine, just believe in yourself!
__label__en	Tucker Carlson is a sociopath.
__label__en	Tucker Carlson is a sociopath with an audience of sociopaths.
__label__en	I don't have cable because I'm not a boomer.
__label__en	I haven't got time.
__label__en	Things have got very complicated.
__label__en	Most bans on gender-affirming care explicitly carve out exceptions for the only actual child genital mutilation going on, that against intersex babies.
__label__en	I haven't got a cat.
__label__en	I haven't got the foggiest idea.
__label__en	I haven't got the faintest idea.
__label__en	Do you know how replace a zip?
__label__en	My back tyre's got a slow puncture.
__label__en	My back tyre has a slow puncture.
__label__en	The meeting is at 2.30.
__label__en	Some of the branches are bare.
__label__en	The doctor told me to eat more fibre.
__label__en	I've been getting headaches.
__label__en	Have you been waiting here long?
__label__en	Let's hope we get there before we run out of money.
__label__en	Let's hope we can get there before we run out of money.
__label__en	A lot of students don't have much money.
__label__en	I haven't got a driving licence yet.
__label__en	The sales assistants haven't got to work today.
__label__en	I haven't got time for a walk.
__label__en	You haven't got to come tomorrow.
__label__en	You've got no reason to be jealous.
__label__en	We haven't got much money.
__label__en	I haven't got time to do what I want to do.
__label__en	We haven't got all the time in the world.
__label__en	You haven't got to make an excuse if you don't want to go with us.
__label__en	I haven't got enough money to pay for the item in cash.
__label__en	I haven't got to go, but you have.
__label__en	I haven't got to go.
__label__en	Oh my FSM!
__label__en	I suppose you haven't got time to answer me.
__label__en	Oh my IPU!
__label__en	But I haven't got any money.
__label__en	They haven't got anything.
__label__en	Look, can you get to the point? I haven't got much time.
__label__en	I want to use the phone, but I haven't got any change at the moment.
__label__en	We haven't got any petrol left.
__label__en	You're the second person who's said that to me today.
__label__en	You're the second person to say that to me today.
__label__en	I can't ring you because I haven't got a phone.
__label__en	We haven't got all night.
__label__en	My friend Bratislav tended to think that extraterrestrials were humanoid in that they had a head, two arms, a body, and two legs. But I opined that extraterrestrials could have different configurations, as different as octopuses and insects on our Earth.
__label__en	Tom must be a good teacher. All his pupils seem to like him.
__label__en	I've had a terrible cough for a week now.
__label__en	You lack self-confidence.
__label__en	You're lacking self-confidence.
__label__en	Compared with the same period last year, profits have fallen by a third.
__label__en	Profits have fallen by a third compared with the same period last year.
__label__en	I've been hungry since this morning.
__label__en	Now it was all over.
__label__en	Good luck in the exam.
__label__en	I lacked self-confidence.
__label__en	I was lacking self-confidence.
__label__en	My girlfriend helped me.
__label__en	He thought up a new prank to play on his neighbour.
__label__en	The wind blew a few snowflakes through the open window, and icy air filled the room.
__label__en	Houses once stood here.
__label__en	The trouble is, everyone talks but no one listens.
__label__en	The trouble is that everyone talks but no one listens.
__label__en	The trouble is that everyone talks, but no one listens.
__label__en	That was naive.
__label__en	It's stiflingly hot.
__label__en	Seeing the sceptical look on the girl's face, he fell silent.
__label__en	The boy smiled sympathetically.
__label__en	What unites them all is a passion for cycling.
__label__en	This was the cause of all his misfortune.
__label__en	This in itself is strange enough.
__label__en	There is no public toilet.
__label__en	There is no public lavatory.
__label__en	There isn't a public toilet.
__label__en	There isn't a public lavatory.
__label__en	He didn't lie, he just didn't tell the whole truth.
__label__en	His energy seems boundless.
__label__en	Despite our lack of sleep, we spent a long time sitting in a pub.
__label__en	It was already half past nine in the evening when we arrived.
__label__en	When we arrived, it was already 9.30 p.m.
__label__en	Tourists have been able to visit the site for fifty years.
__label__en	There's enough food for us.
__label__en	That's pretty spooky!
__label__en	There's probably time for that.
__label__en	What a weird way to ask.
__label__en	It's strange, but I think it's possible.
__label__en	It shouldn't be there anyway.
__label__en	She's a threat to us all!
__label__en	What a way to die, huh?
__label__en	There's no point in crying about it now.
__label__en	I think I will be able to do it.
__label__en	I guess I'll be able to do it.
__label__en	I guess I will be able to do it.
__label__en	I wanna know who did it.
__label__en	Do you speak Udmurt?
__label__en	Alberto was traveling from Bejaia to Algiers to compete in a jiu-jitsu tournament.
__label__en	Alberto was close to everything he needed.
__label__en	Alberto gave Isabella the key code to the room she was staying in.
__label__en	Alberto wasn't tech-savvy.
__label__en	Alberto was just an old guy who wasn't tech-savvy.
__label__en	Alberto heard the tapping on the window once again.
__label__en	Alberto was still very much on edge.
__label__en	Alberto took a shower just to clear his mind.
__label__en	Alberto heard some noise outside.
__label__en	Alberto heard the sound of the lock disengaging.
__label__en	Alberto slammed the door shut in Isabella's face.
__label__en	Alberto responded in a deep voice: "This is my seat."
__label__en	Police eventually came.
__label__en	Alberto was very combative and unapologetic.
__label__en	Alberto was opening the door.
__label__en	Alberto went on a trip to Algiers in the summer of 2004.
__label__en	There was no electricity in the cabin.
__label__en	Alberto was away.
__label__en	Alberto and Isabella had a really nice evening cooking dinner.
__label__en	Alberto decided to sit outside and smoke.
__label__en	Alberto asked if it was Isabella.
__label__en	Alberto groggily yelled: "I'm trying to sleep here!"
__label__en	A tree branch broke off and fell to the ground.
__label__en	Alberto jumped out of bed and rushed to the window.
__label__en	Alberto was a little freaked out.
__label__en	Alberto didn't see anything when he was outside.
__label__en	Alberto was pretty scared at this point.
__label__en	Alberto probably wanted that.
__label__en	Alberto slashed Isabella's tires.
__label__en	Alberto told Isabella to stay very quiet.
__label__en	Alberto had a hunting knife and a large stick.
__label__en	The cabin had huge windows on three walls.
__label__en	Alberto wanted to stay downstairs.
__label__en	Alberto sat in the middle of the bed.
__label__en	Alberto yelled out "hello."
__label__en	Alberto heard nothing for what felt like five minutes.
__label__en	Alberto came up to the loft.
__label__en	Alberto sat on the bed in silence.
__label__en	Isabella was looking at Alberto in terror.
__label__en	The cabin had a pot-belly stove.
__label__en	Alberto heard the front door burst open.
__label__en	Alberto has never been that terrified.
__label__en	Alberto never heard any voices there.
__label__en	Alberto started to hear roosters in the distance.
__label__en	The sounds finally stopped.
__label__en	Alberto packed everything up as quickly as possible.
__label__en	Alberto was trying to scare the campers away.
__label__en	Alberto booked an Airbnb by himself.
__label__en	Alberto was so far from home.
__label__en	The Airbnb was much cheaper than any hotels in the area.
__label__en	Alberto brought his laptop with him.
__label__en	Alberto stayed for four days.
__label__en	Alberto's interview was on a Thursday.
__label__en	Alberto heard a tap on the window.
__label__en	Alberto swung to the left to look at the window.
__label__en	Alberto was kind of scared to look out the window.
__label__en	A bug hit the window.
__label__en	Alberto explored different parts of the town in his car.
__label__en	Alberto was watching Prison Break on Netflix.
__label__en	Alberto was even more disturbed.
__label__en	Alberto rushed to the window.
__label__en	Alberto opened the door and looked outside for a second.
__label__en	Alberto stepped outside onto the back porch.
__label__en	Alberto heard a click.
__label__en	Alberto clicked his tongue at the roof of his mouth.
__label__en	Alberto clicked in response.
__label__en	Alberto was standing not too far away.
__label__en	Alberto started walking a little closer, then stopped.
__label__en	Alberto is on private property.
__label__en	Alberto saw Isabella quickly walk away.
__label__en	Alberto was in his bed on his laptop, watching Netflix.
__label__en	Alberto didn't hear any noises in the house.
__label__en	Alberto turned the light off and tried to fall asleep.
__label__en	The closet door was open just a crack.
__label__en	Alberto stared at the house as he talked to the 911 dispatcher.
__label__en	Alberto got a refund.
__label__en	Who else would have access to Alberto's house?
__label__en	Alberto snuck into Isabella's apartment at an opportune time.
__label__en	Alberto had to stay at the office late almost every day that week.
__label__en	Alberto was finishing up on his work.
__label__en	Alberto told Isabella he was heading out.
__label__en	Alberto heard the front door slam shut.
__label__en	Alberto had to keep himself awake.
__label__en	Alberto started to doze off.
__label__en	Alberto was waiting for the coffee to heat up.
__label__en	Alberto heard the sound of the door closing.
__label__en	Alberto left that door open.
__label__en	Alberto's office was how he had left it.
__label__en	Alberto continued his work.
__label__en	Do you speak Ligurian?
__label__en	The lightning continued to strike about once every five minutes.
__label__en	The screen went black.
__label__en	Alberto felt his heart drop into his stomach.
__label__en	The door closed on its own.
__label__en	The rain continued to hit the window.
__label__en	The lightning startled Alberto a few times.
__label__en	Alberto began closing down his computer.
__label__en	Alberto turned off the screen.
__label__en	Alberto didn't turn around.
__label__en	Alberto calmly grabbed his bag and left the office.
__label__en	Alberto ran down the flight of stairs to the fifth floor.
__label__en	Alberto got into his car and took a second to breathe.
__label__en	Alberto was looking down at Isabella.
__label__en	Alberto asked Isabella to check the office.
__label__en	Alberto was in the office, but didn't see anyone.
__label__en	Alberto's story freaked even Isabella out.
__label__en	Alberto was walking around the office.
__label__en	My child, fly from everything that is evil, and from everything that is like to it.
__label__en	Alberto did security work in an office building in Bejaia, Algeria.
__label__en	Alberto's view of that job changed entirely.
__label__en	All the lights were out.
__label__en	Alberto went down there to investigate.
__label__en	Alberto took the stairs down there.
__label__en	Alberto was the only security guard on duty that day.
__label__en	Going down there alone was nervewrecking.
__label__en	Alberto was navigating the whole area in the dark with nothing but a flashlight.
__label__en	My child, flee from every evil man and from all like him.
__label__en	Many of the doors were bashed in.
__label__en	The corridor leads to storage rooms.
__label__en	The power generator was so badly damaged that it looked it was destroyed with an axe.
__label__en	Alberto was just a security guard.
__label__en	The house had broken-down doors.
__label__en	Alberto heard a slam elsewhere in the basement.
__label__en	Alberto was in a dead-silent basement.
__label__en	Someone was in the basement.
__label__en	The noises stopped.
__label__en	Alberto was scared shitless.
__label__en	Alberto turned off his flashlight.
__label__en	The breathing stopped.
__label__en	Alberto saw a guy with an abnormally long face standing in the dark hallway.
__label__en	Alberto locked the door and called 911.
__label__en	At least five police officers went down there.
__label__en	Alberto was in the lobby when the police officers came back.
__label__en	The cops couldn't find Alberto.
__label__en	Those doors certainly didn't smash themselves open.
__label__en	Alberto had his fist job ever in 2004.
__label__en	Only half the office was finished.
__label__en	Half the office was under renovation.
__label__en	The office was unfinished.
__label__en	Wires were sticking out of sockets.
__label__en	Alberto turned off the lights completely on that side of the office.
__label__en	Alberto made a mad dash to the bathroom and from it.
__label__en	Alberto was to accompany Isabella.
__label__en	Alberto walked to the nurse's office.
__label__en	No one was inside the office even though the lights were on.
__label__en	Alberto just went on a break.
__label__en	The light in the nurse's office was off.
__label__en	Alberto checked the door anyways.
__label__en	Alberto tried the door handle.
__label__en	Alberto was able to open the door.
__label__en	Alberto had a small night light in his room.
__label__en	A guard approached Alberto and asked him what he was doing there.
__label__en	Alberto wasn't lying.
__label__en	Alberto felt the temperature drop.
__label__en	The guard shooed Alberto away.
__label__en	Alberto sat there, stunned.
__label__en	Alberto wouldn't stop crying.
__label__en	Alberto started to hyperventilate.
__label__en	The incident wasn't brought up again.
__label__en	Alberto watched a good scary movie.
__label__en	Alberto is a Jaws fan.
__label__en	Alberto was assigned to the warehouse that night.
__label__en	Alberto was sitting in a comfortable car.
__label__en	Alberto was only half an hour into his shift when Isabella called him.
__label__en	There were only five cameras in the entire warehouse.
__label__en	A lot of expensive equipment was held in that warehouse.
__label__en	Alberto was in the fifth aisle.
__label__en	Alberto was poking out from behind a cabinet.
__label__en	Alberto stopped halfway through the aisle.
__label__en	Alberto ran to the end of the aisle.
__label__en	Alberto looked in that direction.
__label__en	Alberto was a lot closer.
__label__en	Alberto had an extremely pale ghoulish-looking face.
__label__en	Alberto said he would be here in five.
__label__en	Alberto stopped at the end of the aisle.
__label__en	Alberto must have run for it.
__label__en	Alberto ran to try and catch up to the intruder.
__label__en	The stench became overwhelming.
__label__en	Alberto found a dead body lying in a pool of blood.
__label__en	Alberto found a dead body in the warehouse.
__label__en	Alberto threw up the second he made it out of the door.
__label__en	Alberto was still on the phone with the police.
__label__en	The cops had the entire place surrounded.
__label__en	Police were in the warehouse doing forensic work.
__label__en	Alberto was in the warehouse that night.
__label__en	Alberto heard about that creepy abandoned house.
__label__en	Alberto decided to check that abandoned house out.
__label__en	Alberto chickened out and stayed back.
__label__en	This house has been abandoned for a very long time.
__label__en	Alberto couldn't see his hand in front of his face.
__label__en	My child, flee from every evil thing, and from every likeness of it.
__label__en	An entire football field could probably fit in that room.
__label__en	The walls were covered in graffiti.
__label__en	Alberto's flashlight caught something hanging from the ceiling.
__label__en	Alberto headed back to the hole in the wall he entered through.
__label__en	Alberto found a large inverted cross in that room.
__label__en	There were tons of trash everywhere.
__label__en	Alberto shined his light down the stairs, but couldn't see the bottom.
__label__en	Alberto started booking it towards his truck.
__label__en	Alberto kept running as fast as he could.
__label__en	Alberto got into his truck and peeled out of there.
__label__en	What did Alberto see in that abandoned house?
__label__en	Alberto never returned to that place.
__label__en	Alberto used to be a party planner and event coordinator.
__label__en	Alberto rented the big warehouse for the entire weekend.
__label__en	Alberto was on the event planning team.
__label__en	Alberto picked up almost right away.
__label__en	The door had an exit sign on top of it.
__label__en	The door leads to the outside.
__label__en	Alberto went down that flight of stairs.
__label__en	Alberto had to bend down a little bit.
__label__en	Alberto left the key in the lock.
__label__en	Alberto heard a buzzing sound.
__label__en	The door leads to a pitch black room.
__label__en	The buzzing stopped.
__label__en	Alberto was trying to figure out what that sound was.
__label__en	Alberto stood still.
__label__en	Alberto took one more look inside, then left.
__label__en	There is at least one motion sensor in every room of the building.
__label__en	Alberto was hiding behind a pile of cardboard boxes.
__label__en	Alberto told Isabella to come here.
__label__en	Alberto was screaming at the sight of the bear.
__label__en	Alberto didn't ask anymore questions after that.
__label__en	Alberto got everything he could back into the truck.
__label__en	Alberto collected his stuff as quickly as possible.
__label__en	Alberto just wanted to be far away from there.
__label__en	Alberto found a deranged-looking person in the warehouse.
__label__en	Alberto was sitting in the corner.
__label__en	Alberto had a horrible experience down there.
__label__en	Halloween used to be one of Alberto's favorite holidays.
__label__en	Alberto is a very last-minute person when it comes to Halloween costumes.
__label__en	Alberto went to the nearest Halloween store and picked a weird costume for himself.
__label__en	Alberto got to the cashier.
__label__en	Alberto was on the phone with Isabella.
__label__en	Alberto gave Isabella the address.
__label__en	Alberto convinced Isabella to come and pick him up.
__label__en	Alberto was a skinnyish build.
__label__en	Alberto is having a fun party tonight.
__label__en	Alberto shook Isabella's hand and introduced himself.
__label__en	Alberto left to the party at around ten pm.
__label__en	Alberto asked Isabella and her friends who they knew there.
__label__en	There was a commotion by the front door area.
__label__en	Alberto asked: "Who's Isabella." And I said: "I am."
__label__en	Alberto told the about it.
__label__en	The party went on.
__label__en	Alberto even considered calling the cops for a second.
__label__en	Alberto was probably at the party for a couple hours.
__label__en	Alberto drove in the direction of Isabella's house.
__label__en	Alberto pulled to the side of the road and waited for Isabella.
__label__en	Alberto didn't get a good look at who was inside that room.
__label__en	Alberto was very aware of his surroundings.
__label__en	Alberto pulled over and waited.
__label__en	Alberto was obviously shook.
__label__en	Alberto never went back there.
__label__en	Alberto should have pressed charges.
__label__en	Alberto had no idea what Isabella could have possibly wanted from him.
__label__en	Halloween of 2004 was the most terrifying night of my life.
__label__en	Australians don't celebrate Halloween as enthusiastically as North Americans do.
__label__en	Alberto was preparing the Halloween decorations.
__label__en	Alberto was waiting for trick-or-treaters in the living room.
__label__en	Alberto hasn't gone trick-or-treating in over five years.
__label__en	Alberto asked Isabella where we should meet up.
__label__en	Alberto was the one who offered we go trick-or-treating.
__label__en	The bowl was filled with lollipops.
__label__en	Alberto was dressed as a clown.
__label__en	We were all creeped out.
__label__en	The clown was squeaking his rubber nose.
__label__en	When Alberto opened the door, he burst into laughter.
__label__en	Alberto sat down on Isabella's couch.
__label__en	Alberto finished his movie and went to bed.
__label__en	My child, be not an observer of omens, since it leadeth to idolatry, nor a user of spells, nor an astrologer, nor a travelling purifier, nor wish to see these things, for from all these things idolatry ariseth.
__label__en	Alberto was shocked to see the bowl of almonds completely empty.
__label__en	Alberto woke up around five am to noises coming from the hallway.
__label__en	Alberto eventually opened the blinds.
__label__en	Alberto stood motionless, in complete shock.
__label__en	Alberto was perched upon the roof, looking down at Isabella.
__label__en	My child, regard not omens, for this leads to idolatry; neither be an enchanter, nor an astrologer, nor a magician, neither wish to see these things, for from them all is idolatry engendered.
__label__en	The police were called.
__label__en	The police checked out the abandoned house.
__label__en	Alberto was told the house was abandoned.
__label__en	Alberto had a creepy experience during that night.
__label__en	Halloween is only a few weeks away.
__label__en	Alberto is completely terrified.
__label__en	It was a stormy Halloween night.
__label__en	Alberto didn't have any real plans that night.
__label__en	Alberto wanted to be funny.
__label__en	Alberto turned off all the nights.
__label__en	We all started to laugh.
__label__en	Alberto started asking goofy stupid questions.
__label__en	Alberto was messing around.
__label__en	The planche started moving to spell the word: "Stop."
__label__en	Alberto started screaming and freaking out.
__label__en	Alberto's parents weren't home.
__label__en	Alberto went to look through the peephole.
__label__en	What the hell that sound was?
__label__en	Alberto went upstairs to check.
__label__en	Alberto was halfway through the hallway when he heard the noise again.
__label__en	Alberto heard the voice of a girl in the middle of the woods.
__label__en	Alberto heard the sound of something being dropped on the floor.
__label__en	Alberto opened the door quietly and pushed it open slowly.
__label__en	Alberto was standing in the far corner of the room.
__label__en	One of the candles by the Ouija board was blown out.
__label__en	The cop knocked on the door and announced: "Police!"
__label__en	Alberto checked every single bedroom upstairs.
__label__en	Alberto threw the Ouija board in the garbage.
__label__en	Eventually, Alberto left.
__label__en	Alberto didn't sleep too well that night.
__label__en	Alberto never used a Ouija board again.
__label__en	Alberto even had fun doing that.
__label__en	Alberto was listening and muttering incredulously to himself.
__label__en	Companies are doing everything they can to cut costs and reduce turnaround times.
__label__en	Alberto was as dizzy and confused as Isabella was.
__label__en	Alberto sat in silence.
__label__en	The door opened and light flooded the room.
__label__en	As much as squares are not circles, men are not women and women are not men.
__label__en	I don't want to live in a world where people don't know the difference between men and women.
__label__en	People should remember their own humble past.
__label__en	I've told my old friends I'm still the same person inside.
__label__en	My father couldn't stand dogs.
__label__en	I like my neighborhood.
__label__en	She's been sick for such a long time.
__label__en	These pants don't have any pockets.
__label__en	I think I'm falling in love with her.
__label__en	She was recovered and no longer needed her annual check-up visits.
__label__en	We've got two days left.
__label__en	Tom hasn't changed much in three years.
__label__en	It's a three-hour walk.
__label__en	The doctors don't know what's wrong with him.
__label__en	Inefficiency is a form of waste.
__label__en	Americans distrust their own government.
__label__en	Set a goal.
__label__en	Think for a solution.
__label__en	We couldn't agree on a price.
__label__en	The government performed badly.
__label__en	Alberto has to get it right.
__label__en	Alberto was speaking eloquently.
__label__en	Alberto had to play his part right the first time.
__label__en	Alberto wanted to retype the entire page.
__label__en	Alberto wanted to push his creativity.
__label__en	Alberto tried to be more creative.
__label__en	Alberto wants to start learning Berber today.
__label__en	Alberto painted Isabella a portrait.
__label__en	Public opinion plays an important role in the political field.
__label__en	Sparta was deprived of her share in the Amphictyonic privileges; the two votes in the council possessed by the Phocians were transferred to the kings of Macedonia; and Philip was to share with the Thebans and Thessalians the honour of presiding at the Pythian games (B.C. 346).
__label__en	"Grey Aliens" are frequently associated with close encounters and abduction claims. My Dane-French friend Michael here on Lulu Island believes in them. There seems to be a large following of the Grey Aliens. (I sometimes wonder if Michael has also Amerindian ancestry.)
__label__en	The notion that Washington laid down some law against reelecting a President for more than two terms is an example of how a complete error may pass into popular belief and become a superstition.
__label__en	An anthropoid ape has a body which is several times as hardy, durable and mighty as that of even the strongest man, but the ape has not the brain of a civilized man.
__label__en	The super computer bested veteran Jeopardy champs Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter in all categories: the arts, popular culture, science, geography, wordplay and more.
__label__en	She reminds me my dad.
__label__en	King Dodon, a lazy and gluttonous ruler, is greatly worried by his warlike neighbors.
__label__en	I have no ambition to outshine him, nor William Shakespere nor any other erudite.
__label__en	The communist central economic control and the communist way of thinking destroyed the country.
__label__en	The numbers of each organism varied from day to day in a way that showed conclusively the essentially trophic nature of the protozoan population.
__label__en	This is my home and I'm not going to move to make more money.
__label__en	I picked this profession because I liked it.
__label__en	One minute we're in a relationship and now you want us to be friends.
__label__en	Ladybugs are beetles that like crimson clover and hairy vetch.
__label__en	I'm no longer an ordinary person.
__label__en	He was looking at me like I was crazy.
__label__en	Often times I feel like no one gets me.
__label__en	She'll see to my needs when I can no longer leave this bed.
__label__en	If we're being honest with ourselves, no one likes every single part of their own personality.
__label__en	He realized there were some boos mixed with the cheering.
__label__en	I know I won't be able to continue my teaching career because I'm too old.
__label__en	I'm not a good mother.
__label__en	I'm not here to make the decision for you.
__label__en	A new study looks at what sheepdogs do naturally with their flocks to come up with a computer model that can recreate their behavior and apply it to situations well beyond the pasture.
__label__en	I work as a hotel inspector.
__label__en	That worked for a while.
__label__en	Giles Headley the younger was a fine tall youth, but clumsy and untrained in the use of his limbs, and he rode a large, powerful brown horse, which brooked no companionship, lashing out with its shaggy hoofs at any of its kind that approached it, more especially at poor, plump, mottled Poppet.
__label__en	Still she was silent, for the sarcasm in Erskine’s voice was angering her.
__label__en	The collapse of the bridge has also wakened officials all over the country to the threat posed by bridges and other vital infrastructure that might be cracked or showing signs of fatigue as well as to the need for new inspections.
__label__en	He remains popular with the party rank and file.
__label__en	One of the seven dwarves is homosexual.
__label__en	One of the seven dwarves is gay.
__label__en	After a while, the sun set and it became dark.
__label__en	A short time later, the sun set and it became dark.
__label__en	Tom is an OK singer.
__label__en	Relationships with our neighbours, whether friendly or not, play an enormously important role in our day-to-day lives.
__label__en	My younger sister has big eyes and a statuesque nose.
__label__en	I've gotten completely hooked on Twitter recently, and it's not good.
__label__en	I live our relationship by the day without expecting to change anything.
__label__en	Indulgence alone is not kindness.
__label__en	People did not meekly accept the changes that were transforming society.
__label__en	The students put their school shirts on.
__label__en	Her hair was different.
__label__en	Our oldest is a real hothead; if you go against her, she blows her top.
__label__en	My dear cousin, I have a huge favour to ask.
__label__en	Just don't take too long.
__label__en	I know what I'm talking about, since I was there.
__label__en	I had a home, a husband, a son, and parents, then I lost everything.
__label__en	It's really nice of you all to invite me to have dinner.
__label__en	She won't ruin her clothes.
__label__en	I know that it isn't safe here anymore.
__label__en	I'm living the happiest days of my life.
__label__en	This is no longer just a friendship.
__label__en	The sun set behind a mountain.
__label__en	They stole my wheelchair !
__label__en	He said that he hadn't entered the room, but that was a lie.
__label__en	The soccer player is lacing up his shoes.
__label__en	Uncle Tom's car is yellow.
__label__en	It ended in thirty moves, with a repeat move draw, the third match of the FIDE World Chess Championship 2023 between Ian Nepomniachtchi (who now has 2 points) and Ding Liren (now with one point).
__label__en	You look like you're feeling better today.
__label__en	Are the school and neighborhood sketchy?
__label__en	She doesn't want to drink anything.
__label__en	That coward is slipping away.
__label__en	That coward is pulling an Irish goodbye.
__label__en	That coward is taking French leave.
__label__en	You were saving money.
__label__en	At his conference, he didn't say a thing of what was written in the papers.
__label__en	Right now, my big sister is working at a supermarket.
__label__en	I'm leaving you with her.
__label__en	As hard as we try to not be superstitious, there are still annoying coincidences designed to wreck havoc in even the most balanced of minds.
__label__en	Are you thinking of your kids?
__label__en	Here's a letter from our penpal in Beijing.
__label__en	She prepared almond biscuits.
__label__en	It's when a man is drunk that his secrets are sunk.
__label__en	Time is a great teacher; the problem is that he kills his students.
__label__en	You've made a lot of spelling mistakes.
__label__en	Tom didn't carry out his promises.
__label__en	The wind's blowing hard this morning, isn't it?
__label__en	Tom strongly advised against it.
__label__en	There's also a lot of people who call toads "frogs". But that's not the intrinsic meaning.
__label__en	The ancient languages are the most difficult.
__label__en	A father worries about his family.
__label__en	Can you locate this town?
__label__en	Can you locate this city on a map?
__label__en	Tom is correcting a French mistake from a French teacher.
__label__en	It was so funny I forgot to laugh.
__label__en	He's an angel!
__label__en	It's an angel!
__label__en	The glasses are empty and the wine has run out.
__label__en	I took the jam for me.
__label__en	From now on, lots of things are going to change around here.
__label__en	He was getting younger.
__label__en	Why did Agatha Christie choose a Belgian detective?
__label__en	What's with this crappy patch-up job?
__label__en	You're going down in my estimation.
__label__en	Tom has to get to the office quickly.
__label__en	What was the score of the game?

__label__en	Your headache seems to be getting better already.
__label__en	The old lady met a lovely young girl in the park.
__label__en	He who only seeks love from a rose is surely but a butterfly.
__label__en	I've never seen you here.

__label__en	He won't stop snoring!
__label__en	He collaborated with the enemy.
__label__en	Correct me if I make any mistakes!
__label__en	Tom didn't get what he had wanted, so he was angry.
__label__en	That website seems a bit dodgy, I wouldn't enter your credit card information there.
__label__en	Do you speak Tamil?
__label__en	Do you speak Kashmiri?
__label__en	My son doesn't want to give up his pacifier.
__label__en	First of all, let me get something straight.
__label__en	I think I'm just a little hungry.
__label__en	I'll order you something.
__label__en	I sold my land to come here.
__label__en	We can watch a movie or something.
__label__en	He was sitting on the edge of the bed.
__label__en	He kissed her and carried her to the bed.
__label__en	He went to the bathroom before starting the film.
__label__en	I saw a woman pass through the gate without showing her ticket.
__label__en	They are smart.
__label__en	How many episodes do you watch in a row?
__label__en	Tom often makes snide comments.
__label__en	Tom often makes rude comments.
__label__en	Constantly making snide comments about colleagues creates a bad working environment.
__label__en	Tom made a snide remark about how Mary was dressed.
__label__en	Tom made a snide remark about Mary's weight.
__label__en	There's no need to be snide about it.
__label__en	There's no need to be snide.
__label__en	If you could keep from making snide remarks all the time, people might like you more.
__label__en	Tom made a snide remark about the way Mary was dressed.
__label__en	In Greek mythology, it's not necessary to pay taxes.
__label__en	I can't believe this!
__label__en	I remember that man... He spoke so much that it got invasive! And his wife's cut from the same cloth, she couldn't put a sock in it...
__label__en	I can not believe it!
__label__en	The older guests must always be served first, and then the younger ones.
__label__en	I don't trust him at all.
__label__en	I don't trust her at all.
__label__en	You'll tell us!
__label__en	You'll tell us it!
__label__en	My great-grandfather is still alive.
__label__en	It's a difficult week.
__label__en	Languages are used to express a perception of the world.
__label__en	I drank it in one gulp.
__label__en	The door was jammed.
__label__en	He was ready to do it for me.
__label__en	What sentence did you have in minid?
__label__en	He didn't sleep there.
__label__en	We're hoping for an update in the next couple of days.
__label__en	I like your suit, Mister Poppins. Where did you buy it?
__label__en	Not even a detective could have done it better.
__label__en	He set it on fire.
__label__en	The scaffolding fell because of the wind.
__label__en	Let's think about what we can improve.
__label__en	He regularly does things that his parents forbid him from doing.
__label__en	I only understood the real reason for his departure twenty years later.
__label__en	Happy to be of service.
__label__en	Tom sleeps twelve hours a night.
__label__en	One of the armed men tore the blindfold from his eyes.

__label__en	Who benefits from the crime?
__label__en	Who gains from a long war?
__label__en	Alberto worked as a camp counselor at a summer camp.
__label__en	Alberto was chaperoned a large group of kids at the summer camp.
__label__en	Alberto came for five weeks.
__label__en	Alberto worked a total of five weeks.
__label__en	Alberto was ready to finish that job and get home.
__label__en	Alberto wanted to go back to the cabin to go to sleep.
__label__en	Alberto exited the cabin.
__label__en	Alberto was waiting in front.
__label__en	Alberto wasn't supposed to be alone at that hour.
__label__en	Alberto is Isabella's counselor.
__label__en	Alberto told Isabella to wait there.
__label__en	Alberto found Isabella's group at the camp.
__label__en	Alberto chaperoned a small group of fifteen campers.
__label__en	Alberto ran back to the cabin where he left Isabella.
__label__en	Alberto saw a girl walk in there.
__label__en	Alberto was looking for the girl.
__label__en	Alberto heard a girl's scream come from the woods.
__label__en	Alberto heard that scream.
__label__en	Alberto ran for help.
__label__en	Alberto ran into the woods, calling Isabella's names.
__label__en	Alberto was hopelessly running through the dark woods.
__label__en	Alberto continued a bit further.
__label__en	Alberto stood there, as if he were waiting.
__label__en	Alberto turned and started running.
__label__en	Alberto was surprisingly fast, but Isabella kept up.
__label__en	Alberto wanted to follow Isabella.
__label__en	Alberto has been chasing Isabella for a long time.
__label__en	Alberto noticed something in the near distance.
__label__en	Alberto ran over to the light.
__label__en	Alberto was walking in Isabella's direction.
__label__en	Alberto turned and ran.
__label__en	Alberto sprinted all the way back to the camp.
__label__en	Alberto talked to the camp coordinator.
__label__en	Authorities have been alerted about the suspicious activities.
__label__en	Alberto was using that woman, a prostitute, as bait to lure unsuspecting victims into the woods and rob them.
__label__en	Alberto's story takes the cake.
__label__en	Alberto was paying Isabella for her videography and photography skills.
__label__en	Alberto used that as stock footage for his documentaries.
__label__en	Alberto parked his car on a dirt road.
__label__en	Alberto started packing up his copious amounts of equipment.
__label__en	Alberto had to accept it. He was lost.
__label__en	Alberto has never run into that problem before.
__label__en	Alberto had a compass with him.
__label__en	Alberto came across a small building in the middle of the woods.
__label__en	Alberto continued to walk around in the woods.
__label__en	Alberto pushed the door with a bit of force and it opened.
__label__en	Alberto has been sleeping in the woods.
__label__en	Alberto tried his best to fall asleep.
__label__en	Alberto slept in an abandoned house in the middle of the woods.
__label__en	Alberto heard the wind outside.
__label__en	Alberto slept in a tiny bedroom.
__label__en	The closet door was moving.
__label__en	The drift was moving the closet door.
__label__en	Alberto heard something from inside the room.
__label__en	Alberto looked at the closet.
__label__en	Something was coming out from the darkness of the closet.
__label__en	Alberto slept in an abandoned house in the middle of a forest.
__label__en	Alberto saw a man wearing a woman's wig walking and talking to himself in the woods.
__label__en	Alberto didn't want any trouble.
__label__en	Alberto ran away from the house.
__label__en	Alberto kept running until he felt he had escaped.
__label__en	Alberto was trying to find a round in the middle of that vast forest.
__label__en	Alberto hitchhiked his way back to his truck.
__label__en	The house was absolutely abandoned.
__label__en	I can't use logic to explain that.
__label__en	I was thankful I was unharmed.
__label__en	Alberto's apartment complex sits in a pretty safe neighborhood.
__label__en	Alberto wasn't very drunk anymore.
__label__en	Alberto was still tipsy.
__label__en	Alberto was greeted by his German Shepherd, Rocky.
__label__en	Alberto jumped right into bed. He was exhausted.
__label__en	Alberto woke up to growling.
__label__en	Alberto sat up to see what his German Sheperd was looking at.
__label__en	Alberto feared the worst.
__label__en	Alberto's German Shepherd looked at him and fell silent.
__label__en	Alberto opened the door right there and then.
__label__en	Alberto got back into his room.
__label__en	There was no one inside the closet.
__label__en	Alberto called his German Shepherd an idiot.
__label__en	Alberto found a man hiding under his bed.
__label__en	Alberto answered the door in his pajamas.
__label__en	The intruder wasn't in the apartment anymore by the time police came and searched the place.
__label__en	Alberto used to be big on urban exploration.
__label__en	The building hasn't been torn down yet.
__label__en	Alberto was having second thoughts.
__label__en	There wasn't any security patrolling the parameter.
__label__en	Alberto was an urban explorer.
__label__en	Alberto had a huge amount of experience exploring abandoned buildings at night.
__label__en	The floors were creaky.
__label__en	Someone or something was inside that room.
__label__en	The candles were lit.
__label__en	Alberto began his attempt at communicating with some kind of spirit.
__label__en	Alberto's Ouija board session was interrupted by Isabella.
__label__en	Alberto heard the creaking.
__label__en	Alberto quietly packed up his stuff.
__label__en	Gang members regularly visited that abandoned building.
__label__en	Alberto never turned that light on.
__label__en	Alberto screamed: "Run!"
__label__en	Alberto continued running all the way back to his truck.
__label__en	Alberto recorded his visits to abandoned places.
__label__en	Alberto was hearing noises coming from outside of his farmhouse.
__label__en	Alberto heard strange thud sounds.
__label__en	Alberto was stealing our produce.
__label__en	Alberto started yelling: "Stop!"
__label__en	Alberto was approaching the woods.
__label__en	Alberto signaled for Isabella to stop.
__label__en	Alberto stood in place and looked at Isabella.
__label__en	Alberto saw what Isabella was looking at.
__label__en	All Alberto could see was the pale face of that old lady as she stood in the dark.
__label__en	Alberto's face was partially illuminated by the moonlight.
__label__en	Alberto started walking backwards.
__label__en	Alberto let the intruder know that he was armed.
__label__en	Alberto sprinted back to his house.
__label__en	Alberto called the sheriff's office.
__label__en	The cops were very unhelpful.
__label__en	The cops left within five minutes.
__label__en	There was never any followup to this.
__label__en	Alberto was on a road trip from Bejaia to Algiers.
__label__en	Alberto was somewhere in Algeria.
__label__en	Alberto was driving around some desolate town in the middle of nowhere.
__label__en	There was not a single other car in the parking lot.
__label__en	Alberto knew he was in a sketchy area.
__label__en	Alberto begged Isabella to hurry back.
__label__en	Alberto has the runs and needs to go to the bathroom.
__label__en	Alberto described his experience in his own words.
__label__en	Alberto is totally a man.
__label__en	Alberto reminded Isabella of her father's annoying humor.
__label__en	It wouldn't hurt to step outside for a minute just to get some fresh air.
__label__en	Alberto was standing on the far side of the parking lot.
__label__en	Alberto got back in the car and locked the doors.
__label__en	Alberto started slowly, yet menacingly, approaching Isabella's car.
__label__en	Alberto texted Isabella to come back right away.
__label__en	Alberto will be right out.
__label__en	Alberto was a couple hundred feet away.
__label__en	Alberto stopped a couple blocks down the road to catch his breath.
__label__en	Alberto started to find that more and more hilarious.
__label__en	The homeless guy just wanted change.
__label__en	How do you know you're a woman?
__label__en	Alberto described his childhood in Algeria.
__label__en	It blew my mind to be listening to Alberto.
__label__en	Alberto described everything so eloquently.
__label__en	Alberto didn't engage in that conversation in good faith.
__label__en	"I'm a woman." "How do you know that you're a woman?"
__label__en	Alberto read all those compliments.
__label__en	Alberto was talking about somebody else.
__label__en	Alberto felt alone even when he was surrounded by plenty of people.
__label__en	Alberto felt welcome.
__label__en	"I feel like a woman." "And how does this make you an actual woman?"
__label__en	Alberto has no idea who Isabella is.
__label__en	Why do transgender people kill themselves?
__label__en	Alberto says he supports transgender people.
__label__en	Alberto is perfectly fine.
__label__en	Alberto doesn't want to answer Isabella's questions.
__label__en	There was something in the water.
__label__en	There was something in the dark.
__label__en	Alberto and his friends wanted to do some cool mischievous things that night.
__label__en	Alberto lived in a small house on a quiet road.
__label__en	The place was dead.
__label__en	Alberto took off his shirt and jumped into the pool.
__label__en	Alberto was a dumb high schooler.
__label__en	The park was closed at sunset.
__label__en	Alberto was swimming around the pool.
__label__en	Alberto went to the water fountain.
__label__en	Alberto was covering his face.
__label__en	Alberto was walking back to the pool.
__label__en	Alberto was doing the same thing as Isabella.
__label__en	Who was that on the other side?
__label__en	The fish disappeared from view.
__label__en	Alberto pulled Isabella out of the pool.
__label__en	Alberto got to the stairs of the pool.
__label__en	Alberto ran all the way back to Isabella's house.
__label__en	Alberto tried to pull Isabella under the water.
__label__en	Alberto went way too far.
__label__en	Alberto was a dangerous person who had ill intents.
__label__en	It was an ordinary day like any other.
__label__en	Alberto jumped in the pool.
__label__en	Alberto waited for Isabella in the pool.
__label__en	Alberto got ready to jump in the pool.
__label__en	Alberto saw something dark sitting at the bottom of the pool.
__label__en	Alberto was at the bottom of the pool.
__label__en	Alberto wasn't playing around.
__label__en	Alberto burst out the back door.
__label__en	Alberto managed to ressuscitate Isabella.
__label__en	Alberto woke up from a deep sleep.
__label__en	Alberto woke up and looked at the clock.
__label__en	Alberto's bedroom window didn't have a view of the pool.
__label__en	Alberto lives alone.
__label__en	Alberto had to be quiet.
__label__en	Alberto exposed himself.
__label__en	Alberto walked up to the pool.
__label__en	Alberto pulled the body out of the water.
__label__en	Alberto didn't seem to be breathing.
__label__en	Alberto caught glimpse of somebody standing near the woods.
__label__en	The police came surprisingly quickly.
__label__en	Alberto was standing in our bushes.
__label__en	Alberto was staying in a small country inn.
__label__en	Alberto needed to stop for the night.
__label__en	There were a couple other cars parked in the parking lot.
__label__en	The day is basically over.
__label__en	Alberto hopped in the pool.
__label__en	The inn had a pool.
__label__en	Alberto and Isabella played some pool games.
__label__en	Alberto was surrounded by nothing but forest for miles.
__label__en	Alberto didn't appear to be attempting to hide.
__label__en	Alberto was glaring over to us.
__label__en	It's a wonderful night for a swim.
__label__en	It's time to get out of the pool.
__label__en	Alberto was leaving because of Isabella.
__label__en	Alberto and Isabella didn't even speak to each other.
__label__en	Alberto walked to the edge of the pool.
__label__en	Alberto worked with the inn.
__label__en	Alberto completely ignored Isabella's question.
__label__en	Alberto started moving towards the ladder of the pool.
__label__en	Alberto stayed in the pool.
__label__en	The pool had stairs on one side.
__label__en	Alberto was trapped in the pool.
__label__en	Alberto didn't know what Isabella was planning.
__label__en	Alberto's dad called us to come out of the pool.
__label__en	Alberto yelled at John and threatened to call the police.
__label__en	Alberto yelled curse words at Isabella.
__label__en	Alberto's family lived in Algeria.
__label__en	Alberto's old house was on a very quiet street.
__label__en	The neighbor came over and introduced himself as Alberto.
__label__en	Alberto hopped in the shallow end of the pool.
__label__en	What shows do you like?
__label__en	Alberto showed Isabella how to swim.
__label__en	Alberto kept helping Isabella.
__label__en	Alberto heard splashes.
__label__en	Alberto was looking up to Isabella's window, waving.
__label__en	Alberto threw on his bathing suit and ran to the pool.
__label__en	Alberto snuck out through the back door.
__label__en	Alberto was showing Isabella how to swim.
__label__en	Alberto was extra touchy as he was showing Isabella how to swim.
__label__en	Alberto told Isabella to never speak to John again.
__label__en	Alberto was standing in his pool.
__label__en	Alberto waved Isabella over.
__label__en	Alberto listened to his parents.
__label__en	There was a knock at the window.
__label__en	Alberto saw Isabella down below, in his backyard.
__label__en	Alberto went straight to his parents' room.
__label__en	Alberto heard Isabella yelling incomprehensible things outside.
__label__en	Alberto stayed with Grandma until we moved to our new house.
__label__en	Alberto had a babysitter.
__label__en	Isabella was the last babysitter Alberto ever had.
__label__en	Alberto apparently didn't know what personal space was.
__label__en	Alberto didn't make any noise.
__label__en	Alberto turned to see Isabella looking at him.
__label__en	Alberto laughed shyly.
__label__en	Alberto said yes anyways.
__label__en	Alberto didn't ask anything.
__label__en	Alberto set up the X-box in the living room.
__label__en	Alberto wasn't much of a gamer.
__label__en	Alberto showed Isabella how to play better.
__label__en	Alberto was standing so close.
__label__en	The way Alberto was standing so close to Isabella made her feel uneasy.
__label__en	Alberto sat back down on the couch and continued to play.
__label__en	Alberto fell asleep with the TV on.
__label__en	Alberto heard a crunching noise in the hallway.
__label__en	Alberto heard a shuffling noise coming from the closet.
__label__en	Alberto sat up in his bed.
__label__en	The door to the bathroom was half open.
__label__en	I guess the teacher noticed by gasp.
__label__en	Alberto sat there, frozen in fear, as Isabella came closer.
__label__en	Alberto ran to the office downstairs.
__label__en	Alberto's office has a lock.
__label__en	Alberto begged Isabella not to call Dad.
__label__en	Alberto will be home in an hour.
__label__en	Alberto had Isabella's parents' information.
__label__en	Alberto called the police promptly.
__label__en	Alberto still thinks about Isabella.
__label__en	Alberto said goodbye to his mom.
__label__en	Alberto is the kid Isabella will be babysitting.
__label__en	Alberto left as soon as Isabella got there.
__label__en	Alberto headed off to the airport.
__label__en	Alberto had autism.
__label__en	Alberto needs to get himself accustomed to Isabella's behavior.
__label__en	Alberto assumed Isabella was playing.
__label__en	Alberto was just talking to himself.
__label__en	Alberto watched Isabella for the whole weekend.
__label__en	Alberto knew he had closed the front door.
__label__en	The laughs were coming from Alberto's room.
__label__en	Alberto was halfway across the hallway.
__label__en	Alberto asked Isabella what she was doing.
__label__en	Alberto doesn't remember what he was doing.
__label__en	Alberto watched TV with Isabella.
__label__en	Alberto watched TV until the sun went down.
__label__en	Alberto told Isabella to stay in her bed.
__label__en	Alberto woke up an hour later.
__label__en	Alberto was woken up by a noise.
__label__en	Alberto looked throughout the room.
__label__en	Alberto was sitting in a closet.
__label__en	Alberto pulled Isabella out of the closet.
__label__en	Alberto's response was unsettling.
__label__en	Alberto asked Isabella who John was.
__label__en	Alberto's heart skipped a bit as Isabella said that.
__label__en	Alberto told Isabella to stay in bed.
__label__en	Alberto went into the guest room and shut the door.
__label__en	Why would Alberto say that?
__label__en	Alberto tried his best to clear his head.
__label__en	Alberto heard the sound of an object fall and hitting the door.
__label__en	Alberto heard Isabella across the hall.
__label__en	Alberto ran to Isabella's room.
__label__en	Alberto got Isabella out of her bed.
__label__en	Alberto was still OK.
__label__en	Alberto heard Isabella open the front door.
__label__en	Alberto ran to the living room.
__label__en	Alberto walked out the front door.
__label__en	Alberto never returned to that house.
__label__en	Growing up, Alberto always had a babysitter during the week.
__label__en	Alberto needed to be babysat on the weekend.
__label__en	Alberto volunteered to watch Isabella's kids.
__label__en	Alberto had no one to watch his kids.
__label__en	It was already dark out.
__label__en	Alberto seemed super friendly.
__label__en	Alberto always smiled.
__label__en	Alberto seemed to be really nice.
__label__en	Alberto showed Isabella around the apartment.
__label__en	Alberto stood at the door with a big smile on his face.
__label__en	Alberto asked Isabella to come with him.
__label__en	Alberto was up there for a while.
__label__en	Alberto got bore of the game.
__label__en	The upstairs was pretty big.
__label__en	Alberto must be in there.
__label__en	Alberto's room was lit only by a computer screen.
__label__en	The empty room had a lamp on.
__label__en	Alberto was inappropriately touching Isabella.
__label__en	Alberto was rubbing Isabella's shoulder.
__label__en	Alberto was so confused.
__label__en	Alberto and Isabella looked at each other for so long.
__label__en	Alberto's smile vanished.
__label__en	Alberto felt like Isabella was looking at him.
__label__en	Alberto came storming out of the room down the hall.
__label__en	Alberto went into Isabella's room.
__label__en	Alberto asked Isabella if she went into his room.
__label__en	Alberto told Isabella that they should leave.
__label__en	Alberto told Isabella to follow him.
__label__en	Alberto grabbed Isabella by her arm.
__label__en	Alberto screamed something else as Isabella ran to the front door.
__label__en	Alberto was completely insane.
__label__en	Alberto got bad vibes from Isabella.
__label__en	Alberto was luckily near a police station.
__label__en	Alberto let Isabella stay there for the night.
__label__en	Nothing happened to Alberto legally.
__label__en	Alberto managed to get Isabella fired.
__label__en	Alberto was watching the kids.
__label__en	This happened just a few months ago.
__label__en	Alberto was going out with his friends.
__label__en	Alberto wasn't thrilled with Isabella leaving Walid alone.
__label__en	Alberto had to make five trips from the truck to the house because of the amount of groceries he had bought.
__label__en	Alberto put on a show on Netflix.
__label__en	Alberto never condones his kids wasting water.
__label__en	Alberto went back upstairs to resume his shower.
__label__en	Alberto yelled Isabella's name angrily.
__label__en	The light was off in the bathroom.
__label__en	Alberto had to force his way in.
__label__en	Alberto felt more furious than anything.
__label__en	Alberto yanked the shower curtain open.
__label__en	Alberto pulled the shower curtain half open.
__label__en	Alberto screamed until he lost the ability to scream.
__label__en	Alberto's clothes were drenched.
__label__en	Alberto screamed Isabella's name.
__label__en	Alberto checked Isabella's room first thing.
__label__en	Everything about Alberto looked like a zombie.
__label__en	Alberto waited for the cops to come.
__label__en	Alberto thought it was Isabella who came into the house.
__label__en	Alberto left the door to the bathroom unlocked.
__label__en	Alberto described the woman's appearance.
__label__en	Isabella had long and gray hair.
__label__en	Alberto left the house as easily as he entered.
__label__en	Alberto was still walking.
__label__en	Alberto doesn't even know if he should place any charges on Isabella.
__label__en	Alberto went to a family resort in Bejaia, Algeria.
__label__en	Alberto was on vacation around Easter time.
__label__en	Alberto was walking around in a big Easter bunny costume.
__label__en	Alberto hid under the table, crying.
__label__en	Alberto wasn't afraid at all.
__label__en	Alberto told Isabella to stop crying.
__label__en	The kids scrambled to collect Easter eggs.
__label__en	The guy in the Easter bunny suit was interacting with the kids.
__label__en	The Easter bunny is gone.
__label__en	Alberto was wearing a blue sweater.
__label__en	Are you looking for the boy wearing a blue sweater?
__label__en	Alberto ran faster than he ever could.
__label__en	Alberto was holding Isabella's hand and approaching a blue van.
__label__en	Alberto turned to look at Isabella.
__label__en	Alberto was trying to find his mom.
__label__en	Alberto was about to get in his truck.
__label__en	Alberto yelled at Isabella to piss off.
__label__en	Alberto was gone too quickly.
__label__en	Alberto didn't work there.
__label__en	Alberto decided to sue the resort.
__label__en	Alberto was mere seconds away from losing his kid forever.
__label__en	Alberto adopted his son Walid at the age of five.
__label__en	Alberto and Isabella don't have any children of their own.
__label__en	Alberto's wife can't have kids.
__label__en	Alberto has two extra bedrooms in his house.
__label__en	Alberto heard Isabella talking to herself.
__label__en	Alberto talked a lot in his play.
__label__en	Alberto's wife wasn't home.
__label__en	Alberto had a play room.
__label__en	Alberto was sitting at his Lego table, singing a song.
__label__en	Alberto shrugged his shoulders.
__label__en	Alberto was just playing.
__label__en	Alberto witnessed that with Isabella.
__label__en	Alberto went to look out the window to see what Isabella was doing.
__label__en	Alberto was talking to thin air.
__label__en	Alberto expressed to his wife his concern.
__label__en	Alberto was in his playroom still.
__label__en	Alberto heard Isabella laughing.
__label__en	Alberto was talking to his imaginary friend again.
__label__en	Alberto was sitting in the middle of the room with his toys scattered around him.
__label__en	Alberto swung the door open.
__label__en	The closet was empty besides Alberto's toys.
__label__en	Alberto told Isabella he was going to bed.
__label__en	The toys started falling on their own.
__label__en	Alberto slept with the door open.
__label__en	Alberto told Isabella to follow him quietly.
__label__en	A sound was coming from inside the toy closet.
__label__en	Alberto became a believer in the paranormal.
__label__en	Alberto stayed with his mom for a week.
__label__en	Alberto listed the house for sale.
__label__en	Alberto moved out a month later.
__label__en	Alberto brought Isabella back to the apartment.
__label__en	Alberto didn't have a lot of money.
__label__en	Alberto became Walid's roommate.
__label__en	Alberto seemed easy to get along with.
__label__en	Alberto had a twin-sized bed.
__label__en	Alberto gave a really loud laugh.
__label__en	Alberto spent most of his time unpacking his clothes.
__label__en	Alberto was watching TV that night.
__label__en	Alberto heard a very brief noise in the room.
__label__en	Alberto continued watching his show.
__label__en	Alberto wasn't home all day.
__label__en	Alberto was in his room, watching TV.
__label__en	Alberto was getting changed into his pajamas.
__label__en	Alberto heard the noise much clearer.

__label__en	We all grew silent.
__label__en	Alberto wondered what just happened.
__label__en	Alberto was still grappling to understand what just happened.

__label__en	Alberto wanted to go in the water at night.

__label__en	Alberto walked onto the beach.
__label__en	Alberto was so drained.
__label__en	Alberto lounged on the beach until it got really dark.
__label__en	Alberto turned to the house and saw one of the upstairs lights on.
__label__en	Alberto looked at his girlfriend and she looked at him.

__label__en	In the sunny blue-sky morning of the 13th of April of 2023, I was sitting in the teahouse drinking my iced black tea. Lizbeth the Mexican came through the door, and we greeted each other, she still teaching Dance Fitness and Zumba at several schools here on Lulu Island. I suppose some people at the teahouse miss the noisy patois of Taglish of Greg and me. I was just reading my Japanese-language fantasy book Tabi no Nakama, or The Fellowship of the Ring, of the famous J.R.R. Tolkien. Walking back to my house, I saw Nikki the Cypriot Greek and her Korean neighbour, as they continued their six rounds around the neighbourhood block.

__label__en	Bruno was called in to do the night shift.
__label__en	Bruno's store is located on a busy road.
__label__en	Bruno came in to buy beer.
__label__en	Bruno started making weird noises.
__label__en	Bruno has a mental disability.
__label__en	Bruno was looking up at the ceiling.
__label__en	Bruno only responded in loud noises.
__label__en	There weren't any cars in the parking lot.
__label__en	Bruno handed Isabella a bag of chips.
__label__en	Bruno finally turned around and walked out of the store.
__label__en	Bruno felt a bit creeped out.
__label__en	The phone on the counter rang.
__label__en	Bruno caught Isabella off guard and she didn't know what to think.
__label__en	Bruno was becoming paranoid of his surroundings.
__label__en	It wasn't Bruno's problem anymore.
__label__en	Bruno was ready to go to sleep.
__label__en	Why would someone be calling at five am?
__label__en	Bruno felt sick to his stomach as he listened to those weird noises.
__label__en	Bruno heard strange noises coming from all over his house.
__label__en	Bruno refused to get any sleep until the sun came up.
__label__en	Bruno went into the basement for the first time in a while.
__label__en	Bruno found writing on the walls of the hallway.
__label__en	Bruno found various kitchen knives on the floor.
__label__en	Bruno has been living down there.
__label__en	I should have told you about it earlier.
__label__en	Bruno was dangerously ill.
__label__en	Bruno worked in the canine unit for five years.
__label__en	Bruno worked his fair share of graveyard shifts.
__label__en	Bruno worked with Rima, a German Shepherd.
__label__en	Bruno's van was parked inside the crops.
__label__en	Nobody came out of the truck.
__label__en	Nobody was inside the truck.
__label__en	Bruno's German Shepherd almost broke off the leash.
__label__en	Bruno's German Sheperd started going crazy as he approached the trunk of the car.
__label__en	Bruno heard the sound of a twig snapping.
__label__en	I'm sorry for making you feel like you're not a significant part of my life.
__label__en	Bruno felt as if something would reach out and grab him.
__label__en	Bruno heard movement in all directions.
__label__en	Bruno stood still in the crops.
__label__en	Bruno couldn't fight.
__label__en	Bruno was choking Isabella.
__label__en	Bruno was going to die.
__label__en	Bruno turned around, pulled the trigger and killed Isabella.
__label__en	Bruno didn't stop to see which way Isabella went.
__label__en	Bruno still says that today.
__label__en	It still pains me how much of a coward Bruno was.
__label__en	A cop is sworn to protect.
__label__en	She may be concerned about the appearance of her body and what you might think of her.
__label__en	Bruno got a job as a police officer.
__label__en	Bruno was expected to work the night shift.
__label__en	Bruno worked the overnight shift.
__label__en	The worst things happen at night.
__label__en	Bruno had a nightmaring story to tell.
__label__en	There were absolutely no cars to be seen on the road at all.
__label__en	All the stores at this hour were closed.
__label__en	Bruno was driving down a quiet road.
__label__en	Bruno drove slow.
__label__en	Bruno zoomed past a coffee shop.
__label__en	Bruno rolled down his window and stuck his head out.$
__label__en	The shop always closed at five pm on weekdays.
__label__en	He told me that they're now together.
__label__en	Bruno wondered why the lights were on.
__label__en	Bruno heard a sound coming from the basement.
__label__en	Bruno found the door that led downstairs to the dark basement.
__label__en	Bruno wasn't really afraid.
__label__en	Bruno walked down the concrete stairs.
__label__en	Bruno was at the bottom of the stairs.
__label__en	Bruno heard that sound again.
__label__en	Bruno just stood there, waiting for the sound again.
__label__en	The sound came from inside an air vent in the corner.
__label__en	Bruno put his ear up to the van and listened.
__label__en	Bruno heard something in there.
__label__en	Bruno heard the sound of someone breathing.
__label__en	Bruno tried to see into the van.
__label__en	Bruno unholstered his gun.
__label__en	The sound was completely gone.
__label__en	How did Bruno get in there?
__label__en	What was that strange noise?
__label__en	The cops did a thorough investigation.
__label__en	Bruno was in the vents.
__label__en	Bruno used to work at a gas station in Algiers.
__label__en	Bruno worked at a 24-hour gas station.
__label__en	There were still some people coming in.
__label__en	Bruno watched movies on his laptop.
__label__en	Bruno was watching that TV show.
__label__en	The car turned into a gas station.
__label__en	No one stepped out of the truck.
__label__en	The car outside was still there.
__label__en	Bruno's car was parked next to the pump.
__label__en	Bruno was counting money.
__label__en	Bruno heard a car door shut outside.
__label__en	Bruno asked Isabella to come inside.
__label__en	Bruno was actually looking at Isabella.
__label__en	Bruno opened the door and came inside.
__label__en	Bruno walked to the back section of the store.
__label__en	Bruno called out: "Do you need help, sir?"
__label__en	Bruno slowly walked back outside, not looking at Isabella once.
__label__en	Bruno knew Isabella was looking at him.
__label__en	Bruno began waving Isabella over.
__label__en	Bruno started walking very quickly over to the door.
__label__en	Bruno looked like he was reaching for something.
__label__en	Bruno ran to the door so he could lock it.
__label__en	Bruno looked at Isabella and she looked at him.
__label__en	Bruno shut the blinds to the windows.
__label__en	Bruno tried to put it out of his mind.
__label__en	Bruno knocked and knocked and knocked.
__label__en	Bruno stayed hidden in a corner behind the counter.
__label__en	Bruno saw Isabella's truck was still there.
__label__en	Paranoid thoughts came to my head.
__label__en	Bruno's car pulled into the parking lot.
__label__en	Bruno and Isabella got into a long conversation about what just happened.
__label__en	Bruno was not laughing.
__label__en	Bruno was still shaking.
__label__en	Bruno was thinking about what happened.
__label__en	Bruno was delivering Chinese food at a local Chinese place.
__label__en	It was a busy Thursday night.
__label__en	Bruno's boss was always a hard ass.
__label__en	Bruno made the delivery and came back quickly.
__label__en	Bruno gave Isabella a better tip.
__label__en	Bruno stepped out of the car with a small brown bag of food.
__label__en	Bruno was peeking at Isabella.
__label__en	Bruno was trying to hide.
__label__en	Bruno's doorbell is broken.
__label__en	Bruno came inside and left the food on the table.
__label__en	Bruno looked up at the window again.
__label__en	Bruno wasn't at the window anymore.
__label__en	Bruno tried to rationalize.
__label__en	Bruno slowly turned the knob and the door was unlocked.
__label__en	Bruno could hear a fridge nearby.
__label__en	Bruno used his phone as a light.
__label__en	Bruno was in the corner of the kitchen.
__label__en	Bruno dropped the bag of food on the floor.
__label__en	Bruno did another delivery that night and went home.
__label__en	Bruno worked as an overnight security guard.
__label__en	Vandalism started to become a problem.
__label__en	Bruno was driving around the parking lot.
__label__en	Bruno approached the shop.
__label__en	The shop was empty.
__label__en	Bruno headed back to his truck.
__label__en	Bruno approached the entrance to the mall.
__label__en	The security gate was still closed.
__label__en	Bruno heard a click from behind him.
__label__en	Bruno saw someone run behind the counter and hide.
__label__en	Bruno was blaming those hallucinations just simply on the lack of sleep.
__label__en	Bruno shined his flashlight into the shop and scanned the area.
__label__en	Bruno saw someone standing there.
__label__en	Bruno stood next to the light switch.
__label__en	There was no one standing there.
__label__en	Bruno was fairly close to the light switch.
__label__en	Bruno left the mall.
__label__en	Bruno was pretty spooked from the events of that night.
__label__en	Bruno was on security duty.
__label__en	Bruno was heading to a bathroom to relieve himself.
__label__en	Bruno heard a toilet flush.
__label__en	Bruno checked all the stalls in the bathroom.
__label__en	Bruno had a tapping sound coming from the stall next to him.
__label__en	Bruno was staring down at Isabella.
__label__en	The stall was empty.
__label__en	Bruno's heart was thumping like crazy.
__label__en	This happened at around five in the morning.
__label__en	Bruno was happy that he had the next day off.
__label__en	Bruno went to explore an abandoned mall.
__label__en	Bruno didn't have school the next day.
__label__en	It was completely pitch black in there.
__label__en	Bruno explored the lower level of the mall.
__label__en	Bruno heard a bang-like sound coming from the basement.
__label__en	Bruno heard another bang-like sound.
__label__en	Bruno turned off his flashlight.
__label__en	Bruno started hearing muffled sounds in the dark.
__label__en	Bruno started feeling around for Isabella.
__label__en	Bruno knew Isabella was wearing a coat.
__label__en	Bruno was wearing a beanie and a face mask.
__label__en	Bruno tried dragging Isabella.
__label__en	Bruno let go of Isabella.
__label__en	Bruno ran to the same place he came in from.
__label__en	Bruno booked it out of the parking lot.
__label__en	Bruno gave Isabella a firm handshake.
__label__en	Bruno thanked Isabella for saving his life.
__label__en	Bruno used to work in a general store.
__label__en	The mall closed at five pm.
__label__en	The mall closed.
__label__en	The night shift was uneventful most of the time.
__label__en	The mall always had night lights on.
__label__en	Bruno was organizing the shelves.
__label__en	Bruno heard a rattle in the distance.
__label__en	Bruno asked Isabella if there was a problem.
__label__en	Bruno was wearing a dirty blue shirt.
__label__en	Bruno asked Isabella if something was wrong.
__label__en	There was a protocol that Bruno was supposed to follow.
__label__en	Bruno went back to his register behind the counter.
__label__en	Bruno was in direct sight for Isabella.
__label__en	Bruno never backed away.
__label__en	Bruno was watching the cameras.
__label__en	Bruno resumed his cleaning activities.
__label__en	Thankfully, Bruno is gone now.
__label__en	Bruno continued with his work.
__label__en	Bruno went back to the register.
__label__en	Bruno went to the alcohol aisle.
__label__en	Bruno was looking at the top shelf.
__label__en	Bruno stood back up.
__label__en	Bruno was looking at Isabella with a smile.
__label__en	Bruno stared at Isabella and she stared at him.
__label__en	Bruno's smile was a pure look of horror.
__label__en	Bruno felt like Isabella stared into his soul.
__label__en	Bruno ran to the back room and locked the door.
__label__en	Bruno heard a tap at the door.
__label__en	Bruno heard a very gentle tap at the door.
__label__en	Bruno wanted to be anywhere but there.
__label__en	Bruno stepped back outside.
__label__en	Bruno is gone for good this time.
__label__en	Bruno's shift ended.
__label__en	Bruno showed the boss the video footage.
__label__en	Bruno only worked there for another month after that.
__label__en	We took a field trip to an aquarium.
__label__en	Bruno lives an area with nothing but woods and mountains as far as the eye can see.
__label__en	The whole aquarium was empty.
__label__en	Bruno didn't see anyone else.
__label__en	Bruno moved on to the next room.
__label__en	That room had a lot of big tanks with tropical fish.
__label__en	Bruno wore a blue t-shirt.
__label__en	Bruno was about to shake his head no, but Isabella said yes.
__label__en	Bruno passed the bathrooms.
__label__en	Bruno reached an exit door.
__label__en	Bruno finally asked Isabella if she worked there.
__label__en	Bruno got in serious trouble.
__label__en	Bruno told Isabella to strap in.
__label__en	Bruno asked Isabella what she was going.
__label__en	If either of you tries to make any moves, I'll kill you.
__label__en	Bruno wanted to throw up.
__label__en	Bruno kept looking in the rear view mirror every other second.
__label__en	Bruno parked in what appeared to be the middle of nowhere.
__label__en	Bruno told Isabella to step out.
__label__en	Bruno started walking Isabella to the woods with a knife.
__label__en	Bruno seemed ready to run.
__label__en	Bruno ran downhill.
__label__en	Bruno threw the knife at Isabella.
__label__en	Bruno heard the clinking of the knife hitting the ground behind him.
__label__en	Bruno managed to make it back to the aquarium.
__label__en	Bruno didn't even noticed.
__label__en	Bruno got himself in trouble.
__label__en	Bruno started to wonder more and more what Isabella's intentions were.
__label__en	Bruno looked forward to that field trip.
__label__en	The kids were taken to different attractions in Algiers.
__label__en	Bruno took Isabella to some of Algeria's historical sites.
__label__en	The building was preseved due to its historical significance.
__label__en	Bruno carried around a camera.
__label__en	Bruno told Isabella not to expect much from the tour.
__label__en	Bruno visited many colonial homes in Algiers.
__label__en	Bruno was sharing a room with Isabella during that trip.
__label__en	Bruno spent most of the time listening.
__label__en	Bruno was very curious about that home.
__label__en	Bruno adored his wife.
__label__en	Bruno and Isabella are expecting a child.
__label__en	Bruno kept Isabella in the house as much as he could.
__label__en	He has a strange sense of humour.
__label__en	Bruno found Isabella a suitor.
__label__en	Bruno learnt how to sew.
__label__en	Bruno lived in that house until his death.
__label__en	Bruno stopped and became silent.
__label__en	Bruno was staring out from the window.
__label__en	Bruno was standing behind Isabella.
__label__en	The third figure appeared to be a woman.
__label__en	Bruno lived with that family.
__label__en	Bruno and Isabella had a black female servant living with them.
__label__en	Bruno took his students on a field trip to a museum.
__label__en	I assure you there's nothing between us.
__label__en	The building used to be a drug den.
__label__en	The original purpose of the building wasn't known.
__label__en	Bruno wandered off to explore the museum on his own.
__label__en	Bruno returned to the bus.
__label__en	Bruno climbed the stairs, too.
__label__en	The wood was rotting.
__label__en	Bruno went up to the last floor.
__label__en	There were no stairs to the last floor.
__label__en	Bruno watched his steps as he navigated the floor.
__label__en	Bruno heard a ticking noise.
__label__en	Bruno was making a ticking noise to call his cat.
__label__en	Bruno makes this ticking noise when he calls his cat.
__label__en	All that was left of Bruno's body were a few stray fingers.
__label__en	Bruno kept making the ticking noise.
__label__en	Bruno pulled his arm out of the hole.
__label__en	Bruno nudged Isabella to move.
__label__en	Bruno heard a crash far behind him.
__label__en	Bruno jumped through one of the holes.
__label__en	Bruno looked dangerous and unstable.
__label__en	Bruno looked up again.
__label__en	Bruno seemed much closer.
__label__en	Bruno looked up one more time.
__label__en	Bruno started to laugh.
__label__en	Bruno made it back safely.
__label__en	Bruno was genuinely disturbed.
__label__en	Bruno was pretty mad at Isabella.
__label__en	Bruno advised we should leave the building.
__label__en	That camping trip was the most horrific thing Bruno had ever been through.
__label__en	Bruno is looking for treasure.
__label__en	Maybe we could find treasure in this part of the island.
__label__en	Glorious London! Leviathan of human greed; palpitating hot-bed of iniquity and joy; Greek, Roman, Spanish, Saxon, Kelt, Scot, Pict, Norman and Dane have swept over thee like winter storms; and the mighty Cæsar, Julius of old, with a myriad of bucklered warriors and one hundred galleons of sailors, triple-oared mariners, defying wave and fate, have ploughed the placid face of Father Thames, startling the loud cry of hawk and bittern as his royal prows grated on thy strand, or skimmed over the marshes of thy infancy.
__label__en	Taiwan asks deplaning passengers to report travel histories and any obvious symptoms.
__label__en	We live in a space-time continuum.
__label__en	As far as I know, nobody looked at me.
__label__en	What nonsense are you talking about!
__label__en	Would you like a spot of tea with your scone?
__label__en	As far as I know, there are no limits.
__label__en	Spanglish is working its way into popular culture, in music and television shows, but some Spanish language experts see Spanglish as a threat to Spanish culture.
__label__en	Nature is culture.
__label__en	In 1960, linguists predicted that compulsory education, mass media, foreign immigration and the “mobility of restless Americans” would ultimately standardize English, and in only a few generations, regional accents would disappear.
__label__en	According to Ms. Morillon, the report disproves the theory that economic prosperity is a precondition for democracy.
__label__en	Nature, both in her palpable and impalpable aspects, may be said to be the book of life wherein are recorded the movements, the expressions, and the diacritics of life.
__label__en	Bruno started talking to that girl.
__label__en	Bruno decided to just bite the bullet and ask Isabella out on a date.
__label__en	We went inside easily, but how will we find the exit?
__label__en	Semis are allowed to drive in Algiers with proper permits.
__label__en	Bruno and his friends went to the beach at night and had a little bonfire with some drinks.
__label__en	Bruno headed straight to the beach.
__label__en	Bruno started a bonfire.
__label__en	Bruno and Isabella were the only people on the beach.
__label__en	Bruno started to unload the truck.
__label__en	Bruno couldn't get the fire to catch.
__label__en	Bruno and Isabella chilled in the dark, drinking beers and talking.
__label__en	Bruno and Isabella looked at each other with telling faces of how freaked out they were.
__label__en	Bruno went into the turned on the headlights.
__label__en	Bruno has likely been there the whole time.
__label__en	Bruno lost sight of Isabella.
__label__en	There was tall grass everywhere.
__label__en	Bruno got in the truck right away and left.
__label__en	Bruno heard the whistling again.
__label__en	Bruno backed down the hill.
__label__en	Bruno was getting into the truck.
__label__en	Bruno heard a humming from the same spot.
__label__en	Bruno switched his lights off.
__label__en	Bruno was in the grass.
__label__en	Bruno heard the truck start.
__label__en	Bruno was looking through the glass into Isabella's truck.
__label__en	Bruno may be sick in the head.
__label__en	Bruno left the beach.
__label__en	Bruno drove off the beach.
__label__en	Bruno had no idea what Isabella's intentions were.
__label__en	Bruno rented a beach house for the weekend.
__label__en	Bruno went out to eat dinner.
__label__en	Bruno found a couple carboard boxes in the basement.
__label__en	Bruno made it to the bottom.
__label__en	Bruno looked at what Isabella was pointing at.
__label__en	Bruno saw that object.
__label__en	Bruno was floating in the water.
__label__en	Bruno slid down the sand hill.
__label__en	Bruno saw a blue object in the water.
__label__en	Bruno yelled at Isabella to look at the ocean again.
__label__en	Bruno and Isabella were discussing what that thing could be.
__label__en	Bruno was staying at a beach house.
__label__en	Bruno found a dead animal floating in the water.
__label__en	Bruno stood up at a towering height.
__label__en	Bruno slammed the door behind him.
__label__en	Bruno went for a night swim.
__label__en	Bruno looked around the beach and didn't see anyone.
__label__en	Bruno and Isabella were sharing a room.
__label__en	Bruno yelled at Isabella to go back to her room.
__label__en	Bruno walked over to see what it was Isabella was staring at.
__label__en	Bruno threanted to call the police on Isabella.
__label__en	Bruno yelled at Isabella to go stay with the kids.
__label__en	Bruno is not a big guy and is far from a fighter.
__label__en	A bunch of police cars came to Bruno's house.
__label__en	Bruno was on drugs.
__label__en	Bruno got his money back.
__label__en	Bruno wanted to go to the beach firework show.
__label__en	Godzilla was on his way.
__label__en	The beach was almost empty.
__label__en	Bruno drove to a less crowded beach.
__label__en	Bruno was sitting on a beach chair.
__label__en	Bruno was ready to watch the fireworks from there.
__label__en	Bruno had to cross a tunnel to get to the amusement park.
__label__en	The fireworks started shooting into the air.
__label__en	Bruno had the beach to himself.
__label__en	The firework show was decently long.
__label__en	Bruno was watching the firework show.
__label__en	Bruno picked all his stuff up and started speed-walking back to his truck.
__label__en	Bruno greeted Isabella and asked her for help.
__label__en	Bruno was instantly wary of that guy.
__label__en	Bruno's friend was injured and needed help.
__label__en	Bruno continued to inch away from Isabella.
__label__en	Bruno asked Isabella where her friend was.
__label__en	The tunnel was completely pitch black.
__label__en	Bruno seemed incredibly off.
__label__en	Bruno's tone changed to more annoyed and angry.
__label__en	Bruno whispered to Isabella to keep walking.
__label__en	Bruno wasn't far behind.
__label__en	Bruno told Isabella to run ahead to the tunnel.
__label__en	Bruno made it to the tunnel.
__label__en	Bruno started shouting: "Hey, come here!"
__label__en	Bruno got to the entrance of the tunnel.
__label__en	Bruno booked it through the tunnel.
__label__en	Bruno was in fear for his life.
__label__en	Bruno stopped chasing Isabella.
__label__en	The parking lot was empty besides two other cars.
__label__en	Bruno drove out of the parking lot.
__label__en	Bruno was mugged and murdered.
__label__en	Bruno felt trapped.
__label__en	They were in this hole together, and he might well need the blubbery loudmouth's help to get out—if there were any way to get out.
__label__en	Iraq has now become a country that's struggling not to fall apart.
__label__en	Politically, Iraq is in shambles.
__label__en	The US knows how to destroy countries.
__label__en	Algeria is back on the road to greatness.
__label__en	Experts say the colossus almost certainly depicts King Psamtik I, who ruled Egypt between 664 and 610 B.C.
__label__en	The consul mopped his sweating, beefy face and cursed Venusian air-conditioning units.
__label__en	Bruno was serving out his years in a state penitentiary.
__label__en	Bruno has no known living relatives.
__label__en	“Vietnam is emerging as a key player in Southeast Asia’s medical tourism industry,” the consultancy says.
__label__en	Bruno struggled to understand Berber.
__label__en	They became guerilla fighters, hiding out in the jungles.
__label__en	Bruno surrendered in a surprisingly calm manner.
__label__en	Life on the island wasn't exactly idyllic.
__label__en	Bruno didn't believe was over.
__label__en	Bruno finally surrendered.
__label__en	Bruno emerged from the depths of the jungle and surrendered to the authorities.
__label__en	"Would you like a glass of wine?" "Yes, please."
__label__en	They were making violent threats.
__label__en	War is costly.
__label__en	War is full of horrors.
__label__en	Bruno was sent to Guantanamo.
__label__en	Bruno can't watch Netflix content from that country.
__label__en	Bruno deliberately got himself arrested.
__label__en	Prisoners in Guantanamo were subjected to unspeakable torture.
__label__en	Zelenskyy wants to transform Ukraine into a vassal state of NATO.
__label__en	Bruno refused to abandon his homeland.
__label__en	There were four of us.
__label__en	Bruno was put on trial.
__label__en	This tale has been told and retold for centuries.
__label__en	Bruno wants to speak Berber a little bit better.
__label__en	Bruno has a few distant relatives in Algeria.
__label__en	Bruno learnt to speak Berber with Rima.
__label__en	Bruno went to Algeria to completely immerse himself in Arabic and Berber.
__label__en	Bruno started learning Berber today.
__label__en	Bruno set up some traps.
__label__en	Bruno disappeared, never to be seen again.
__label__en	Bruno disappeared forever.
__label__en	Tom was rewarded for what he had done.
__label__en	They played a game of Chinese whispers.
__label__en	Bruno started to dance uncontrollably.
__label__en	Bruno can't explain what happened that day.
__label__en	Bruno asked Isabella if she believed in ghosts.
__label__en	Bruno tried to scare Isabella when she came home from school.
__label__en	Bruno calmed Isabella down.
__label__en	Bruno was on the computer.
__label__en	Bruno wished Isabella didn't say that.
__label__en	Bruno shot a Nerf gun at Isabella.
__label__en	Bruno was determined to speak to Isabella about what happened that day.
__label__en	Bruno watched YouTube videos.
__label__en	Bruno will be leaving soon to go to a friend's house.
__label__en	Bruno was a very quiet kid when no one was around.
__label__en	Bruno made much noise.
__label__en	Bruno paused his YouTube video and headed to the bathroom.
__label__en	Bruno was in the bathroom, facing the door.
__label__en	The house has a short hallway.
__label__en	The stairway leads to the attic.
__label__en	Which door has been used?
__label__en	Bruno heard a loud thud come from his brother's room.
__label__en	Bruno flushed the toilet and washed his hands.
__label__en	Bruno's stomach started to ache from fear.
__label__en	Bruno waited for another noise.
__label__en	Bruno didn't have his phone on him.
__label__en	Bruno heard talking coming from his brother's room.
__label__en	It couldn't have been Bruno.
__label__en	Bruno couldn't understand what that voice was saying.
__label__en	Bruno came out of his brother's room.
__label__en	Bruno stopped dead in his tracks, right at the door.
__label__en	Bruno covered his mouth to keep from breathing loudly.
__label__en	Bruno heard the door open and close.
__label__en	Bruno didn't know if he was safe or not.
__label__en	Bruno went to the laundry room.
__label__en	The door opened and closed.
__label__en	Bruno wasn't sure what to do.
__label__en	Bruno waited in the bathroom for what seemed like an eternity.
__label__en	Bruno waited for his parents to get home.
__label__en	Bruno's door didn't have a lock on it.
__label__en	Bruno doubted Isabella as well.
__label__en	Bruno will never forget that day.
__label__en	Bruno may never know the truth.
__label__en	Bruno was living with his mom.
__label__en	Bruno walked alone at night.
__label__en	Bruno had a creepy neighbor.
__label__en	Bruno lived on the fourth floor.
__label__en	Bruno looked at Isabella when she entered the apartment.
__label__en	Bruno told Isabella to stay away of that man.
__label__en	Bruno was balding and his remaining hair was grey.
__label__en	Bruno wasn't exactly sure how Isabella got his name.
__label__en	Bruno was home alone all night.
__label__en	Bruno was sitting at his window sill.
__label__en	Bruno asked Isabella if Walid is working tonight.
__label__en	Bruno slowly nodded his head.
__label__en	Bruno washed up a little bit.
__label__en	Bruno did laundry.
__label__en	Bruno heard a weird rumbling noise.
__label__en	Bruno got out of the shower after hearing that noise.
__label__en	Bruno heard a noise outside of the bedroom.
__label__en	Bruno threw on the clothes he had in the bathroom and started searching the house.
__label__en	Bruno saw what was on the other side.
__label__en	Bruno ran back to the shower.
__label__en	Bruno drilled a hole in the wall to spy on Isabella.
__label__en	Bruno didn't drill those holes.

__label__en	Claudio aggressively slammed his window shut.
__label__en	Claudio threw a rock at Isabella's window, but she ignored it.
__label__en	Claudio heard a noise coming from below his window outside.
__label__en	The sound kept getting closer.
__label__en	Claudio didn't know what to think.
__label__en	Claudio was trying to climb up to Isabella's window.
__label__en	Claudio turned to face the doorway.
__label__en	Claudio was standing at Isabella's door in his pajamas.
__label__en	Claudio didn't even get out of his bed.

__label__en	Claudio wasn't going anywhere.
__label__en	Claudio avoided eye contact with Isabella.

__label__en	Claudio had the whole family over.
__label__en	Claudio was a heavy smoker.
__label__en	Claudio went outside to smoke throughout the night.
__label__en	The phone rang a few seconds after Claudio went outside.
__label__en	Claudio went out the front door.
__label__en	There is a little hallway with two doors.
__label__en	Claudio didn't seem to be there.
__label__en	Claudio came out of the shed.
__label__en	Claudio started walking to Isabella fast.

__label__en	Claudio is the tenant from donwstairs.
__label__en	Claudio found Isabella smoking in the backyard.
__label__en	Claudio just charged at Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio doesn't take things Isabella says seriously.
__label__en	Claudio walked back upstairs.
__label__en	Claudio seemed a little concerned.
__label__en	Claudio waited until Isabella was done.
__label__en	Claudio started getting ready for bed.
__label__en	Claudio watched a Christmas movie.
__label__en	Claudio woke up suddenly.
__label__en	The Christmas tree blocked Claudio's view of the stairs.
__label__en	The fire was almost dead.
__label__en	The movie Claudio was watching was almost over.
__label__en	Claudio was so comfortable.
__label__en	Claudio heard something rustling by the tree.
__label__en	Claudio flipped back on his other side.
__label__en	Claudio was standing over Isabella, bending slightly.
__label__en	Claudio screamed even louder.
__label__en	Claudio tried to cover Isabella's mouth.
__label__en	Everyone heard Claudio.
__label__en	Claudio stormed out of his room.
__label__en	Claudio made sure Isabella was asleep.
__label__en	Claudio shared another important information.
__label__en	Claudio has recently gotten a new job as a psychiatric nurse.
__label__en	Claudio arrived to work early.
__label__en	Claudio sat at a computer for most of the night.

__label__en	A dim set of lights turned on.
__label__en	Claudio has been creeping Isabella out.
__label__en	Claudio had severe schizophrenia.
__label__en	Claudio was just talking to himself.
__label__en	Claudio was awake the whole night.
__label__en	Claudio looked away from Isabella and started muttering something.
__label__en	Claudio checked the bathroom.
__label__en	Claudio asked Isabella to repeat herself, but she didn't acknowledge him.
__label__en	Claudio swore at Isabella, but she didn't acknowledge him.
__label__en	The lights wouldn't turn on.
__label__en	Claudio heard a click sound from one of the stalls.
__label__en	Claudio got on his knees and checked under the stalls.
__label__en	One stall had its door shut.
__label__en	Claudio got back down on his knees to look under the bed.
__label__en	Claudio took a look through the crack of the door.
__label__en	Claudio managed to run to the door and slam it shut.
__label__en	There was someone in the bathroom.
__label__en	No one was inside.
__label__en	Claudio called Isabella before his shift ended.
__label__en	Claudio walked to the front door with his jacket on.
__label__en	Claudio's smile didn't give Isabella a good feeling.
__label__en	There was something unsettling about Claudio's smile.
__label__en	What did Claudio see in that bathroom?
__label__en	Claudio wanted to do something new with his girlfriend.
__label__en	It was our first Yennayer in the apartment.
__label__en	Claudio cut down his own Christmas tree.
__label__en	Claudio went to a forest full of spruice trees.
__label__en	There was snow on the ground.
__label__en	Claudio pulled off the road.
__label__en	Claudio was in a very hilly part of the park.
__label__en	Claudio was searching for a small spruice tree that could fit in his living room.
__label__en	Claudio started chopping away at the truck of the spruice tree.
__label__en	Claudio didn't carry the spruice tree alone.
__label__en	Claudio dragged the spruice tree to his truck.
__label__en	Claudio threw Isabella the keys.
__label__en	Claudio hurried to the truck.
__label__en	Claudio sat down on the trunk of the spruice tree.
__label__en	Claudio was standing by the freshly cut spruice tree.
__label__en	The spruice tree was sitting on the ground.
__label__en	Claudio tried to sneak up on Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio went to hide behind a big pine tree.
__label__en	Claudio was in a coat.
__label__en	It was dark again.
__label__en	Claudio could barely see Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio started sprinting down the hill, back to the truck.
__label__en	Claudio started hearing screams.
__label__en	Claudio got to the bottom of the hill.
__label__en	Claudio heard the truck's horn honking.
__label__en	Claudio screamed at Isabella to drive.
__label__en	Claudio was watching Isabella drive away.
__label__en	Claudio stopped at a Home Depot and bought a Christmas tree from there.
__label__en	Claudio's grandparents passed away.
__label__en	Claudio let Isabella live in that apartment.
__label__en	Claudio enjoyed living alone.
__label__en	Claudio did whatever he wanted.
__label__en	Claudio brought a German Shepherd dog named Rex.
__label__en	Claudio named his German Shepherd "Rocky" after Rocky Balboa.
__label__en	Claudio's German Shepherd was thirsty.
__label__en	Claudio adopted a German Shepherd.
__label__en	Claudio rubbed his eyes as he was walking down the stairs.
__label__en	Claudio went down there with Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio isn't going down there alone.
__label__en	Claudio flipped all the lights.
__label__en	Claudio's German Shepherd is silent now.
__label__en	Claudio's German Shepherd looked at him.
__label__en	Claudio's German Shepherd was looking at a closet door.
__label__en	Claudio opened the closet door.
__label__en	Who was in the closet?
__label__en	Claudio's German Shepherd attacked the intruder.
__label__en	Claudio took his German Shepherd by the collar.
__label__en	Claudio went to the kitchen to call his dad.
__label__en	Claudio picked up and said hello in a groggy voice.
__label__en	Claudio told Isabella that he was scared.
__label__en	Claudio put the phone down for a second to listen.
__label__en	Claudio ran to his bathroom.
__label__en	Claudio hung up the phone.
__label__en	Claudio left a large amount of cash in the bedroom.
__label__en	Claudio happened to be home that night.
__label__en	This story took place just five weeks ago.
__label__en	Claudio's fear has subdued a little bit.
__label__en	Claudio came on a cold Thursday night.
__label__en	Claudio was playing FIFA with his friend.
__label__en	Claudio had headphones on.
__label__en	Claudio heard a noise come from behind him.
__label__en	Claudio had to get up.
__label__en	Claudio found that a bit unsettling.
__label__en	Claudio tried to continue playing.
__label__en	Claudio couldn't focus on the game anymore.
__label__en	Claudio took off the headphone.
__label__en	Claudio took off the headset.
__label__en	Claudio walked really slowly to the back side of the basement.
__label__en	The closet was most likely the source of the sound.
__label__en	Claudio got a terrible painful feeling in his stomach as he approached the closet.
__label__en	Claudio was looking at the vents.
__label__en	Claudio started shaking the door aggressively.
__label__en	Claudio called the cops and told them to send someone right away.
__label__en	Claudio locked the door and hid.
__label__en	The situation only became worse.
__label__en	Claudio was screaming things like "where are you?" and "I'll kill you!3
__label__en	Claudio thought Isabella was going to break the door down.
__label__en	A police car pulled up in front of the house.
__label__en	The cops went inside the apartment with their guns drawn.
__label__en	The cops drove away.
__label__en	Claudio was giving Isabella the most evil stare you would ever imagine.
__label__en	Claudio was living in his old house.
__label__en	Claudio has a pool table in the basement.
__label__en	Claudio heard things come from the boiler room.
__label__en	Claudio knew what that sound was.
__label__en	The room was empty of any people.
__label__en	Nobody was in the laundry room.
__label__en	Claudio was walking to the kitchen.
__label__en	Claudio heard the TV downstairs turn on.
__label__en	Claudio called his brother's name, but no one answer.
__label__en	Claudio was upset with Isabella for waking him.
__label__en	Claudio was going to move to his new house.
__label__en	Claudio kept the TV downstairs.
__label__en	Claudio was once again playing video games.
__label__en	Claudio thought it was Isabella at first.
__label__en	Claudio heard a ball bouncing downstairs.
__label__en	Claudio ran upstairs, screaming.
__label__en	Claudio once again went downstairs.
__label__en	Claudio told Isabella to wait there.
__label__en	Claudio was holding the door shut.
__label__en	Claudio was pulling the door shut.
__label__en	Claudio still doesn't know what to make of what was going on in that old and creepy house.
__label__en	Claudio is still living with his mom and dad.
__label__en	Quarantining started.
__label__en	Claudio's room is in the basement.
__label__en	Claudio had an extra room in the house.
__label__en	Claudio is going to be moving out soon.
__label__en	Claudio knocked on the wall and it seemed to be hollow.
__label__en	Claudio used his iPhone flashlight to navigate the dark basement.
__label__en	Claudio set up his Xbox on the TV.
__label__en	Claudio was playing War Zone on his Xbox.
__label__en	The noise came from Claudio's room.
__label__en	Claudio placed the vase on the table.
__label__en	Claudio woke to some weird muffled thuds.
__label__en	Claudio walked to the air vents.
__label__en	A small animal was inside the vent.
__label__en	Claudio woke up at five in the morning, feeling extremely thirsty.
__label__en	Claudio found a bottle.
__label__en	Claudio heard something from the basement.
__label__en	Claudio said that very quietly.
__label__en	Claudio finished his descent downstairs.
__label__en	Claudio went back to his room to hit the hay.
__label__en	Claudio looked at that little vent on the wall.
__label__en	Claudio saw a cockroach crawl out of the vent.
__label__en	Claudio moved away just as the light revealed him.
__label__en	Claudio screamed like a girl as he ran upstairs.
__label__en	Claudio shined a light in the vent.
__label__en	There was no one inside the vent.
__label__en	Claudio was seeing things because he hadn't got enough sleep.
__label__en	The basement door has a lock on it.
__label__en	Claudio made a shocking discovery.
__label__en	There was a secret door on the wall that was left open.
__label__en	Claudio has been living in this room for five months.
__label__en	Claudio watched Isabella as she slept.
__label__en	Claudio may come back.
__label__en	It's April 5, 2004 as I write this.
__label__en	Claudio lives on the other side.
__label__en	Claudio wasn't entirely comfortable with that situation.
__label__en	Claudio opened the app.
__label__en	Claudio was walking through the doorway.
__label__en	Claudio was supposed to go shopping.
__label__en	Claudio checked his apartment.
__label__en	Nothing was touched.
__label__en	Curiosity ate away at Claudio that night.
__label__en	Claudio smelt a burning smell.
__label__en	Claudio couldn't find anything stolen.
__label__en	That's against the law, isn't it?
__label__en	Claudio closed his laptop and went to his room.
__label__en	Claudio saw Isabella standing in the corner.
__label__en	Claudio had something in his hand that Isabella couldn't see.
__label__en	Claudio started walking to Isabella like a zombie.
__label__en	Claudio slammed the door shut and locked it.
__label__en	Claudio yelled at Isabella to stop before he called the police.
__label__en	Claudio peeked into the outside.
__label__en	Claudio came to Isabella's side of the house.
__label__en	Claudio entered his apartment.
__label__en	Claudio claimed he had a sleep-walking problem.
__label__en	Claudio barricaded the door with the dresser.
__label__en	Claudio didn't believe Isabella's sleep-walking story.
__label__en	Quarantining has had Claudio going crazy.
__label__en	Claudio pulled up on a hilly road.
__label__en	Breaking into the abandoned house was easy.
__label__en	The floors were extremely creaky.
__label__en	People have already looted the abandoned house out.
__label__en	Claudio went to explore a different section of the house.
__label__en	Claudio heard someone in another room.
__label__en	Claudio refused to go over there.
__label__en	Claudio quietly laughed.
__label__en	Claudio was a pussy.
__label__en	Claudio was exploring an abandoned farmhouse surrounded by woods in the middle of the night.
__label__en	A staircase went to the basement.
__label__en	The stairs have collapsed.
__label__en	Claudio looked down into the basement.
__label__en	I have no intention of financing such an initiative.
__label__en	He dragged him out of the bathroom.
__label__en	You're trying to provoke me into putting my hands on you.
__label__en	He could have been forty, forty-five years old at most.
__label__en	He had a very thick beard.
__label__en	How do you know when the postman comes to your house?
__label__en	Where did you put the post?
__label__en	I asked Tom to do that, not Mary.
__label__en	I've asked Tom to do that, not Mary.
__label__en	I wanted Tom to answer that question, not Mary.
__label__en	Claudio heard a noise come from the basement.
__label__en	Claudio went to look down there.
__label__en	Claudio shined his flashlight into the darkness below.
__label__en	Claudio got on his knees to get a deeper look at the well.
__label__en	Claudio was looking at Isabella with this lifeless smile.
__label__en	Claudio ran to his friends.
__label__en	Claudio has already left the house.
__label__en	Claudio exited the property.
__label__en	Claudio didn't see what Isabella saw.
__label__en	Why was Claudio down there?
__label__en	What else was down there?
__label__en	That farm has been abandoned for years.
__label__en	The stairs were collapsed.
__label__en	Tom didn't need to stay here until 2:30.
__label__en	Tom didn't need to get here until 2:30.
__label__en	Claudio DM'd Isabella's account.
__label__en	Claudio was sitting in his room, doing his homework.
__label__en	Claudio tried to rationalize.
__label__en	Claudio got a notification from Instagram that he got a new follower.
__label__en	Tom asked Mary to pass the bottle to him.
__label__en	Claudio's Instagram profile had five followers.
__label__en	Claudio had his Instagram profile set to public.
__label__en	Claudio clicked on the notification.

__label__en	A hundgun was sticking out the bag.
__label__en	Claudio tried the door handle very quietly, but it wouldn't open.
__label__en	Let's wait out the rain here.
__label__en	Claudio was getting desperate.
__label__en	Claudio couldn't call the cops.
__label__en	Claudio didn't know what Isabella might do.
__label__en	Claudio made sure Isabella wasn't looking.
__label__en	Claudio slipped behind Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio fled before Isabella could do anything.
__label__en	Claudio was waiting for the light to turn green.
__label__en	Claudio found a perfect escape point.
__label__en	Claudio had to be quick.
__label__en	Claudio made Isabella feel a little better.
__label__en	Claudio tried the lock button.
__label__en	Claudio screamed for Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio was able to open the door.
__label__en	Claudio drove off, completely avoiding Isabella.
__label__en	New turnstiles have been installed in the subway.
__label__en	Claudio reported the driver to Uber.
__label__en	An officer showed up at Claudio's front door for questioning.
__label__en	Tom can open a beer with his teeth.
__label__en	Claudio was a former Uber driver.
__label__en	Claudio pretended to be handicaped to get a free ride.
__label__en	Claudio came on Thursday night, in December.
__label__en	Claudio had a new Honda Accord.
__label__en	Claudio was a very skinny fourteen-year-old.
__label__en	Claudio responded to the customer's request.
__label__en	Claudio saw a group of teenagers hanging out near the bus shelter.
__label__en	Claudio wanted to get away from that group of teenagers.
__label__en	Claudio approached Isabella from behind.
__label__en	Claudio told Isabella to hop in.
__label__en	Claudio said that very clearly.
__label__en	Claudio finally understood Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio sat diagonally from Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio entered Isabella's address into his phone.
__label__en	Claudio smelt like cigarettes.
__label__en	The address Claudio gave the Uber driver was five miles away.
__label__en	Claudio stopped talking when Isabella completely ignored one of his questions.
__label__en	Claudio was afraid to look into the rear-view mirror.
__label__en	Claudio wasn't staring at Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio wanted that ride to be over as soon as possible.
__label__en	Claudio lived on a basically deserted street.
__label__en	The road seemed to lead to a dead-end street.
__label__en	Our car broke down, so we had to call a taxi.
__label__en	Claudio was still watching Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio finally summoned up the courage to ask Isabella out.
__label__en	Claudio finally answered yes.
__label__en	Claudio's house was surrounded by nothing but woods.
__label__en	A house came into sight.
__label__en	Nothing could be seen.
__label__en	Claudio wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.$
__label__en	Claudio yelled out at Isabella to turn around.
__label__en	Claudio kept a blade in the glovebox.
__label__en	Claudio was ready to use the blade.
__label__en	Claudio saw nothing but trees on either side.
__label__en	Claudio knew that something was about to go down.
__label__en	Claudio needs help carrying his bag.
__label__en	Claudio didn't have a bag.
__label__en	The shakiness in Claudio's voice was too obvious.
__label__en	Claudio felt pressure on his neck.
__label__en	Claudio released his grip on Isabella's neck.
__label__en	Claudio turned the car around and floored it down the street.
__label__en	Claudio just wanted to go to sleep and forget about it.
__label__en	Claudio resigned from Uber.
__label__en	After that incident, Claudio decided to resign from Uber.
__label__en	"That's Tom Jackson." "The Tom Jackson?"
__label__en	Claudio and Isabella were home alone on a Thursday night.
__label__en	Claudio could hear everything.
__label__en	Claudio was talking to himself in the den.
__label__en	Claudio heard a slight tapping coming from the window.
__label__en	Claudio was tapping on the back door.
__label__en	Claudio flipped on the outside light.
__label__en	Claudio was at the backyard door.
__label__en	Claudio almost run away.
__label__en	Claudio looked at Isabella as if he needed help.
__label__en	Claudio told Isabella that he needed to use her phone.
__label__en	Claudio pleaded with Isabella to let him in.
__label__en	Claudio blocked the door with his arm.
__label__en	Claudio saw Isabella standing there still.
__label__en	Claudio told Isabella to stay upstairs.
__label__en	Claudio was trying to be brave.
__label__en	Claudio went downstairs to the den.
__label__en	Claudio didn't shut the door in the first place.
__label__en	Claudio looked to his left.
__label__en	I could have sworn the door was shut earlier.
__label__en	Claudio pressed the button.
__label__en	The phone took the picture.
__label__en	Claudio was hunched over his office desk.
__label__en	Claudio ran upstairs and locked the door.
__label__en	Claudio said that the cops were there.
__label__en	Claudio heard a door open and shut.
__label__en	Claudio got caught and arrested.
__label__en	The cops did not arrive for another five minutes.
__label__en	The cops didn't arrive for another five minutes.
__label__en	Claudio has been talking about hunting.
__label__en	"I've read their books." "Whose books?" "The Strugatsky brothers'."
__label__en	Claudio decided to take Isabella on a hunting trip.
__label__en	Claudio stayed there over the weekend.
__label__en	Claudio headed that way.
__label__en	Claudio found an abandoned property in the middle of nowhere.
__label__en	Claudio went to his hunting cabin.
__label__en	Claudio's hunting cabin had two very small rooms.
__label__en	Claudio was getting settled for the night.
__label__en	Claudio didn't like being so exposed.
__label__en	Claudio climbed into bed.
__label__en	There was a noise outside.
__label__en	Claudio heard what sounded like trash cans being banged one against the other.
__label__en	Don't wake me up unless the cabin is on fire.
__label__en	Please go back to sleep.
__label__en	The court sentenced him to be hanged.
__label__en	Claudio stopped at the fore window.
__label__en	The noise was followed by tapping on the window.
__label__en	Claudio told Isabella to load her gun as he did himself.
__label__en	Claudio was playing a trick on Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio went to a sketchy hotel.
__label__en	Claudio came by multiple times a week.
__label__en	Claudio needs to clean his vomit-smelling room.
__label__en	Claudio hated working over there.
__label__en	Claudio stayed at a rundown motel.
__label__en	Claudio wanted to get done in a hurry.
__label__en	Claudio saw a man in the reflection staring at him.
__label__en	Startled, Claudio screamed: "Oh, my God!"
__label__en	Claudio was more polite.
__label__en	Claudio just stared back at Isabella with a crooked grin.
__label__en	Claudio was holding a thousand-dinar bill.
__label__en	Claudio was staying in the room next door.
__label__en	Claudio wanted to have fun with Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio wanted to run out of the room.
__label__en	Claudio ran out of the room, screaming.
__label__en	Claudio wanted Isabella to come into his room to meet his wife.
__label__en	Claudio prayed to God that Isabella would just go away.
__label__en	Claudio had no wife.
__label__en	How do you know it's safe?
__label__en	Claudio was trying to kidnap Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio could easily have overpowered Isabella.
__label__en	The phone on the counter wasn't working.
__label__en	Claudio cut the line.
__label__en	Claudio just has to get out.
__label__en	Claudio paid Isabella for cleaning his room.
__label__en	Claudio was cleaning that room.
__label__en	Claudio was wasting too much time looking for his phone.
__label__en	Claudio could hear the cop's shoes slamming onto the pavement after him.
__label__en	Claudio could no longer hear Isabella searching for him.
__label__en	Isabella collapsed into her boss's arms.
__label__en	Claudio was actually wanted for sexual assault.
__label__en	Claudio was charged with rape.
__label__en	A few weeks after that, Claudio quit.
__label__en	Claudio never worked at a motel.
__label__en	Claudio would never work at another motel.
__label__en	Claudio is five years younger than Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio said he was hungry.
__label__en	Claudio lived with his brother.
__label__en	Claudio always had money.
__label__en	Claudio worked full-time.
__label__en	Claudio learnt how to take care of himself.
__label__en	Claudio was always out, walking at night.
__label__en	The streets were pretty quiet.
__label__en	The pizza store was nearby.
__label__en	Claudio was walking on that street.
__label__en	The car pulled up to Claudio.
__label__en	Tom keeps money and important documents in the safe.
__label__en	Claudio was driving a dark blue car.
__label__en	Claudio yelled for Isabella to run, but she was frozen in place.
__label__en	Claudio heard the car door slam shut.
__label__en	We don't have any side streets.
__label__en	Claudio knows the city well.
__label__en	Claudio was heading away from home.
__label__en	Claudio was in tears.
__label__en	Claudio really didn't know what to do.
__label__en	Claudio got to the other side of the school.
__label__en	Claudio was out of breath.
__label__en	Claudio was speeding down the street like a mad man.
__label__en	Claudio turned down another street.
__label__en	Claudio started to cry out.
__label__en	Claudio was so close to the bush that Isabella was hiding in.
__label__en	Claudio got back into his car and took off.
__label__en	Claudio ran for home.
__label__en	Claudio was driving down a one-way street.
__label__en	Claudio was wanted on five counts of murder.
__label__en	This happend to Claudio and his brother five months ago.
__label__en	Claudio and Isabella are planning on going on a vacation.
__label__en	Claudio made it out of prison alive.
__label__en	Claudio really hopes nothing happens to Isabella in prison.
__label__en	Claudio was a relatively large guy.
__label__en	Claudio weighs about the same as Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio can handle himself extremely well when the situation calls for it.
__label__en	Claudio isn't violent by any means.
__label__en	Claudio decided to go to a local nightclub.
__label__en	Claudio had a few drinks.
__label__en	Claudio decided to sit down.
__label__en	The dancing started to make Claudio sweat.
__label__en	Claudio was sitting down.
__label__en	Claudio was eye-balling Isabella's brother.
__label__en	Claudio needed some water.
__label__en	Claudio gave Isabella a bottle of water.
__label__en	Claudio was still glaring at Isabella's brother.
__label__en	What the fuck are you staring at?
__label__en	Claudio was really large.
__label__en	Claudio walked towards the exit of the nightclub.
__label__en	Claudio pushed Isabella outside the exit door.
__label__en	Claudio was much smaller than Isabella was.
__label__en	Claudio escorted Isabella to the exit.
__label__en	Claudio heard a loud thud.
__label__en	Claudio saw his brother lying face down on the concrete.
__label__en	Claudio started violently swinging the crawbar at Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio hit on the back of his leg.
__label__en	Claudio attempted to strike Isabella again.
__label__en	Claudio hit the floor.
__label__en	Claudio's accomplice sprinted away.
__label__en	Claudio called for an ambulance.
__label__en	Shortly after the ambulance came, the police arrived.
__label__en	Claudio was pronounced dead at the scene.
__label__en	Claudio was in shock, but extremely grateful.
__label__en	Claudio was hit by that man.
__label__en	Claudio came to his mother's house.
__label__en	Claudio's father died from cancer.
__label__en	Claudio's father died when him and his brother were very young.
__label__en	Claudio was put into a cell for a few days.
__label__en	I type faster than Tom, but slower than Mary.
__label__en	In jail, you never know what the next day holds.
__label__en	Claudio talked to Isabella about a curious encounter in the woods.
__label__en	Claudio was a young boy in his teens.
__label__en	Claudio had this friend named Walid.
__label__en	Have you ever been to his house?
__label__en	That's how Claudio got to know Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio seemed nice.
__label__en	Claudio saw Isabella at various parties.
__label__en	Claudio had long hair.
__label__en	Claudio was into smoking pot.
__label__en	Claudio had long hair and smoked pot.
__label__en	Claudio needed to take care of some business.
__label__en	Claudio excused himself to leave for something.
__label__en	Claudio lined up a joint.
__label__en	Claudio noticed Isabella staring at him intensely.
__label__en	Claudio had that feeling once before.
__label__en	Claudio kept talking about going to a party.
__label__en	Claudio noticed Isabella staring at him.
__label__en	When Claudio noticed Isabella staring at him, it gave him the creeps.
__label__en	Claudio was up in New York.
__label__en	Claudio assisted John in raping Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio invited Isabella over to a party.
__label__en	Claudio tortured John before killing him.
__label__en	Claudio finally put an end to that.
__label__en	Claudio dug up Isabella's body.
__label__en	Claudio buried his victims in the woods.
__label__en	Claudio's true victim count is much higher than twent-four.
__label__en	Claudio only watched the murders.
__label__en	Claudio is still serving time in jail.
__label__en	Claudio is still serving time in prison, likely for the rest of his life.
__label__en	Claudio had strong instinct.
__label__en	Claudio was never targetted.
__label__en	Claudio was lucky as hell he was never invited to that party.
__label__en	Claudio was just a casual acquaintance.
__label__en	Claudio served in the Vietnam war from 1960 to 1964.
__label__en	Claudio didn't mention those details.
__label__en	Claudio didn't like to tell that story.
__label__en	Those events were particularly traumatizing.
__label__en	Claudio was crawling through a deep tunnel.
__label__en	The tunnel was empty and silent.
__label__en	Claudio heard a faint crying sound in the dark.
__label__en	There was a woman screaming for help.
__label__en	Claudio continued to crawl through the tunnel.
__label__en	There was a broken chair in the basement.
__label__en	Claudio continued deeper into the tunnel.
__label__en	The stench of death became overwhelming.
__label__en	The guys weren't killed by just bullets.
__label__en	Claudio had to turn around and flee.
__label__en	Claudio crawled back out of the tunnel.
__label__en	Claudio and Isabella looked at each other with wide eyes.
__label__en	Claudio picked up his pace even more.
__label__en	Claudio looked back every ten seconds.
__label__en	The tunnel has been searched and cleared.
__label__en	Claudio logged plane parts.
__label__en	Claudio played games on his phone.
__label__en	Claudio was working on that plane.
__label__en	Claudio shot Isabella a few texts.
__label__en	The call rang five times then went to voice mail.
__label__en	Claudio waited and waited, but Isabella never showed up.
__label__en	Claudio sounded like a grown man in his forties.
__label__en	Claudio asked the man if he had seen anyone who might have resembled his brother.
__label__en	Claudio walked to his car which was parked in the parking lot.
__label__en	Claudio and Isabella separated from each other.
__label__en	Claudio met John at a sketchy motel.
__label__en	This is the closest town to the base.
__label__en	What was Claudio doing there that late?
__label__en	Claudio pulled into the little parking lot and parked.
__label__en	The location of Claudio's phone was in the woods.
__label__en	Claudio looked around the whole parking lot and could find his car.
__label__en	Claudio called to Isabella: "Are you alone?"
__label__en	Claudio inched his way closer to his truck.
__label__en	Claudio called his supervisor and told him that Isabella was missing.
__label__en	Claudio was with Isabella at that moment.
__label__en	Claudio tracked Isabella's phone.
__label__en	Claudio asked for a ride back to the base.
__label__en	Claudio asked Isabella to pull over by the woods.
__label__en	Claudio armed Isabella's arm and squeezed it as she was trying to get out of the car.
__label__en	Claudio went back to the base to talk to his supervisor.
__label__en	It's possible Claudio destroyed the phone.
__label__en	Claudio got Isabella and her sister in the woods.
__label__en	Claudio married Isabella during his days as a Marine.
__label__en	It was a pretty slow shift with not much going on.
__label__en	Claudio wasn't allowed to be on his phone.
__label__en	Claudio tried his best to follow that rule.
__label__en	Claudio began to hear a woman humming.
__label__en	Claudio started following the sound of the humming.
__label__en	Claudio walked along the long wall of trees.
__label__en	Claudio struggled to make it to the other side.
__label__en	Claudio walked closer to the grave.
__label__en	Claudio heard a buzzing sound coming from the shed.
__label__en	The door didn't have any sort of lock on it.
__label__en	The buzzing sound was coming from inside of the shed.
__label__en	Claudio lied flat on the floor.
__label__en	Claudio saw nothing at all.
__label__en	Claudio let out a blood-curdling scream.
__label__en	Claudio has told Isabella to meet him now.
__label__en	Claudio looked through the hole, but saw nothing.
__label__en	Claudio knew the boss didn't believe him.
__label__en	Claudio witnessed something completely supernatural.
__label__en	Claudio doesn't know the woman that he saw could have been.
__label__en	Claudio was buried in the El Alia Cemetery in Algiers.
__label__en	Claudio bought weed on the deep web.
__label__en	Claudio doesn't condone doing anything like this.
__label__en	Claudio continued browsing Tatoeba.
__label__en	Claudio joined a drug chatroom.
__label__en	Claudio found Tatoeba interesting.
__label__en	The link brought Claudio on a blank page.
__label__en	Claudio's chatroom didn't have a title.
__label__en	Claudio and Isabella were talking in another language.
__label__en	Claudio typed "yo!" and Isabella typed "yo!" back.
__label__en	Claudio typed "yo!" directed at Isabella.
__label__en	It took a little while to load the page.
__label__en	The video was black and white.
__label__en	Claudio was watching a live video.
__label__en	Claudio suddenly jumped up and sprinted towards the camera.
__label__en	All Claudio could see was black.
__label__en	Claudio couldn't type anything.
__label__en	Claudio tried to disguise his voice.
__label__en	Claudio has all your files.
__label__en	Claudio was able to get the basic info off Isabella's computer.
__label__en	Claudio was visiting a safe website.
__label__en	You don't have to answer the question.
__label__en	Claudio is from a small town called Sidi Aich in Algeria.
__label__en	Claudio was out to get Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio is an active poster on that page.
__label__en	Claudio opened up his Gmail and went to the spam folder.
__label__en	Claudio wrote a paragraph full of his personal information.
__label__en	Claudio's heart was in his throat.
__label__en	Claudio covered his webcam with a piece of tape.
__label__en	Claudio went to report the account on Reddit.
__label__en	Claudio got an email five minutes later.
__label__en	Claudio will never hear from Isabella again.
__label__en	Claudio didn't have that amount of money.
__label__en	Claudio threatened to call the police.
__label__en	Claudio might have issues with Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio paid the money.
__label__en	Claudio left his laptop off the whole next day.
__label__en	Claudio didn't sign into Reddit.
__label__en	Claudio was so bored.
__label__en	Claudio got new emails.
__label__en	Everything still looked normal.
__label__en	The meeting was held behind closed doors.
__label__en	Claudio talked about computer hackers.
__label__en	The bottom of the screen turned darker.
__label__en	Claudio knew right away what that was.
__label__en	Claudio was in the picture.
__label__en	Claudio was laying in his bed, sleeping.
__label__en	Claudio called his parents.
__label__en	Some hacker has Claudio's pictures and is threatening to publish them on social media.
__label__en	Claudio was embarrassed by it.
__label__en	Claudio blocked that email address.
__label__en	Claudio finally got back to his apartment.
__label__en	Claudio hasn't reported that to the police.
__label__en	Isabella has had her share of experiences with stalkers.
__label__en	Claudio clicked the link and her computer started to get all glitchy and unresponsive.
__label__en	Claudio asked Isabella if she was the one who posted that on Instagram.
__label__en	Claudio's pictures were extremely embarrassing.
__label__en	Claudio asked Isabella to Snapchat-call him.
__label__en	Isabella is Claudio's digital girlfriend.
__label__en	Claudio set his Instagram profile to private.
__label__en	Claudio said that with a smile.
__label__en	Claudio refused to show the rest of the picture.
__label__en	Claudio told all his friends about it.
__label__en	Claudio activated the two-factor veritication feature on his Facebook.
__label__en	Blocking Claudio on Facebook was a stupid thing to do.
__label__en	Claudio got a snap from Isabella.
__label__en	Don't block me again.
__label__en	Claudio ran outside in a fit of rage.
__label__en	Claudio did absolutely nothing.
__label__en	Cops seemed clueless on the matter.
__label__en	If you fuck with me again, you'll be arrested.
__label__en	Claudio got a computer virus.
__label__en	Claudio clicked on the link and a new browser opened.
__label__en	Claudio closed the page.
__label__en	Claudio deleted the email.
__label__en	Claudio's computer was working much slower.
__label__en	Claudio froze for a few seconds.
__label__en	Claudio tried restarting his computer.
__label__en	Claudio used his dad's computer in the basement to do his homework.
__label__en	Claudio couldn't move the cursor outside of the little window.
__label__en	The computer finally responded.
__label__en	Claudio fixed the issue.
__label__en	Claudio was able to use his laptop again.
__label__en	The program detected a large number of viruses.
__label__en	Claudio ran a deep and through cleaning of his computer.
__label__en	Claudio's laptop got back to normal working speed after that.
__label__en	Claudio got a virus from a suspicious-looking email.
__label__en	Claudio deleted the email and went about his day.
__label__en	Windows kept popping up on the screen.
__label__en	Claudio opened his email again.
__label__en	Claudio felt threatened.
__label__en	Claudio opened the email and downloaded the contact.
__label__en	Claudio was using his laptop.
__label__en	Claudio was filmed doing some embarrassing things.
__label__en	Claudio placed a piece of tape over his webcam.
__label__en	Claudio did a factory reset of his computer.
__label__en	The police said they would use their forensics team to find the culprit.
__label__en	Claudio saved all his important files on a flashdrive.
__label__en	The program started installing.
__label__en	Claudio wanted to install the game on his laptop.
__label__en	Claudio deleted the file.
__label__en	Claudio restarted his computer.
__label__en	Claudio's computer started acting up.
__label__en	Claudio didn't do anything to fix the issue.
__label__en	Claudio turned the computer off for a couple hours.
__label__en	Claudio returned to his room to prepare for bed.
__label__en	Claudio's desktop wallpaper was changed.
__label__en	Claudio turned the computer off by holding the power button for a few seconds.
__label__en	It was still completely pitch black outside.
__label__en	Claudio heard a loud aggressive bang on his window.
__label__en	Claudio gathered the courage to get up and check.
__label__en	Claudio set the picture as his desktop wallpaper.
__label__en	Claudio went under his bed to grab his gun.
__label__en	The picture on the window was gone.
__label__en	Claudio got a virus from trying to download that game.
__label__en	Claudio became the target of some serious hacker.
__label__en	Claudio scared off Isabella's stalker.
__label__en	Claudio was able to sleep after that.
__label__en	Claudio is currently forty-four years old.
__label__en	Claudio was doing really poorly in one of his coding classes.
__label__en	Claudio wanted to learn C++.
__label__en	Claudio doesn't condone cheating.
__label__en	Claudio decompressed the folder and viewed the contents.
__label__en	Claudio tried to decompress the folder.
__label__en	The folder was password-protected.
__label__en	Claudio checked the folder.
__label__en	Claudio's computer made a weird noise.
__label__en	Claudio tried running the program at least five more times.
__label__en	Tom's contributions are getting uncomfortably confessional.
__label__en	Claudio nearly shat himself.
__label__en	Claudio was dazed and confused.
__label__en	The screaming sound seemed to be coming from Claudio's laptop.
__label__en	Claudio always kept his laptop closed at night.
__label__en	Claudio felt scared approaching his computer to turn it off.
__label__en	Claudio couldn't move the cursor.
__label__en	Claudio held the power button on his laptop until it turned off.
__label__en	Claudio booted his computer into safe mode.
__label__en	Claudio received a letter with no return address.
__label__en	Claudio threw the letter in the trash.
__label__en	Claudio never received anything else in the mail that week.
__label__en	Claudio lives in a very secluded mountainous place in Bejaia, Algeria.
__label__en	Claudio changed out of his work clothes into his running clothes.
__label__en	Claudio did five minutes of walking.
__label__en	Claudio's German Shepherd is always a joy to walk.
__label__en	Claudio's German Shepherd stopped in her tracks.
__label__en	Claudio's German Shepherd was looking behind us.
__label__en	Claudio tried to pull his German Shepherd forward to continue their walk.
__label__en	Claudio was looking at Isabella and her German Shepherd.
__label__en	Claudio's German Shepherd finally budged and started walking by his side again.
__label__en	Claudio looked down at his German Shepherd.
__label__en	Claudio's German Shepherd stopped him again.
__label__en	Claudio was walking slowly towards Isabella and her German Shepherd.
__label__en	The closer Claudio got, the slower he walked.
__label__en	Claudio maintained eye contact with Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio continued approaching Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio's German Shepherd started barking in the other direction.
__label__en	Claudio knew something bad was about to go down.
__label__en	Claudio started full-on charging Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio's German Shepherd bit Isabella on the leg.
__label__en	Claudio tackled that man to the ground.
__label__en	Claudio's German Shepherd ran back down the trail.
__label__en	Claudio got back to the house in five minutes.
__label__en	Claudio's German Shepherd was still alive and well.
__label__en	Claudio's German Shepherd was hurt.
__label__en	Claudio's German Shepherd chased that man.
__label__en	Claudio's German Shepherd started barking like a rabid dog.
__label__en	Claudio has a very large closet.
__label__en	Claudio woke up to growling.
__label__en	Claudio's German Shepherd was standing in the middle of the room.
__label__en	Claudio wondered what his German Shepherd was growling at.
__label__en	Claudio's imagination was running wild.
__label__en	Claudio woke up again.
__label__en	Claudio's German Shepherd was in the center of the room.
__label__en	Claudio's German Shepherd was looking up at the closet.
__label__en	Claudio heard a set of Legos spill out in the den.
__label__en	Claudio heard his bedroom door open.
__label__en	Claudio told his German Shepherd to check the closet.
__label__en	Claudio was dressed in jeans.
__label__en	Claudio pushed Isabella, causing her to fall./
__label__en	Claudio heard Isabella rushing down the stairs.
__label__en	Claudio saw his German Shepherd's teeth sunk into Isabella's arm.
__label__en	Claudio was moaning in pain.
__label__en	Claudio brought Isabella outside.
__label__en	Claudio was taken away in an ambulance.
__label__en	Claudio ended up winning the case.
__label__en	Claudio saved the day.
__label__en	Claudio walked his German Shepherd twice a day.
__label__en	Claudio insisted Isabella walk the German Shepherd.
__label__en	Walking Claudio's German Shepherd became a huge chore.
__label__en	There was too much snow.
__label__en	The roads have been plowed.
__label__en	Claudio lived on a very quiet road.
__label__en	Claudio heard the sound of footsteps crushing the snow behind him.

__label__en	Claudio passed the big oak tree in the yard and went straight to the front door.
__label__en	Claudio found a homeless guy in the crops.
__label__en	Claudio hoped that his German Shepherd would come back.
__label__en	There wasn't much the cops could do.
__label__en	Claudio let his German Shepherd sleep inside.
__label__en	She spoke several European languages fluently.
__label__en	Her hair caught fire.
__label__en	My words had the desired effect.
__label__en	He stormed into the room.
__label__en	Nothing like that would have happened on my watch.
__label__en	The fault is mine alone.
__label__en	He teaches his children how to hurt others.
__label__en	I want you to know that I'll support you, whatever decision you make.
__label__en	He acknowledges that he deserves the sentence.
__label__en	Kids ask a lot of questions.

__label__en	English is an unstandardized language. It has a set of de facto rules. Colloquial English strays far enough from literary English that it could be considered broken.

__label__en	Claudio walked through the clearing.
__label__en	Claudio found his way back.
__label__en	Claudio calmly called: "Hello?"
__label__en	Claudio felt safe to continue walking.
__label__en	Claudio heard the sounds of evening crickets.
__label__en	Claudio was moaning in discomfort.
__label__en	Claudio walked towards the noise.
__label__en	Claudio was calling out: "Hello?"
__label__en	Claudio was standing in the fog, in front of Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio was making moaning sounds.
__label__en	Claudio asked Isabella if she needed assistance.
__label__en	Claudio took two more steps towards Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio started walking back through the clearing.

__label__en	Claudio followed Isabella's voice in the dark.
__label__en	Claudio called out for Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio didn't know if Isabella was big or small.
__label__en	Claudio was no longer calling out for Isabella.
__label__en	Claudio knew in his gut that something wasn't right.
__label__en	Claudio heard Isabella's voice in front of him, but he couldn't see her.
__label__en	Claudio was standing mere feet away from Isabella.
__label__en	Something bad was going on there.
__label__en	Claudio ran for his truck.
__label__en	Claudio started his truck and did a three point turn.
__label__en	Claudio was still back there.
__label__en	Inside, there was literally nothing.
__label__en	The police opened an investigation.
__label__en	Nothing came out of the investigation.
__label__en	Claudio came on an insanely foggy day.

__label__en	Claudio had his tent set up.
__label__en	It was very dark in the woods.
__label__en	It was very warm out.
__label__en	We all jumped in the water.
__label__en	The water is perfect to jump in.
__label__en	We all brought towels.
__label__en	The water was calm.
__label__en	Starting a fire was particularly difficult for Claudio.
__label__en	Claudio couldn't get the wood to catch fire.
__label__en	Claudio started to scream he was drowning.
__label__en	Claudio ran as fast as he could into the water.
__label__en	Claudio was splashing about.
__label__en	Claudio pulled Isabella up above the water.
__label__en	Claudio got out of the water.
__label__en	Claudio began moving out of the lake.
__label__en	Claudio yelled in a panic.
__label__en	Claudio was able to break free.
__label__en	Claudio made it back to the campsite.
__label__en	Claudio sat down on the cooler.
__label__en	Claudio's ankle was pouring out blood.
__label__en	Claudio felt more relaxed and at ease.
__label__en	Eels don't live in this lake.
__label__en	Claudio was on land.
__label__en	The sun was completely gone.
__label__en	Claudio was talking about life.
__label__en	We all looked over our shoulders at the same time.
__label__en	We resumed conversation for a few minutes.
__label__en	Claudio went to check the tent.
__label__en	Claudio was still hearing noises.
__label__en	Claudio looked at where Isabella's light was pointed.
__label__en	This fish lives in the lake.
__label__en	Claudio was looking at us.
__label__en	Claudio made another splashing noise.
__label__en	Claudio took all his important stuff and went.
__label__en	Claudio took all his valuable and left the apartment.
__label__en	Claudio returned with his dad to collect the tents.

__label__en	There was a presence with us in the woods.
__label__en	Claudio needs to stop trespassing on Isabella's property.
__label__en	There was no sign of ackowledgment from Claudio.
__label__en	Claudio was standing maybe ten yards away.
__label__en	Claudio kept looking back every five seconds.
__label__en	Claudio heard footsteps close behind him.
__label__en	Claudio started to feel threatened.
__label__en	Claudio's only protection in the woods was his German Shepherd.
__label__en	Claudio held his German Shepherd back.
__label__en	Claudio saw a set of glowing eyes in the dark.
__label__en	Claudio started to run back towards his house.
__label__en	Claudio made it to his backyard.
__label__en	Claudio just stood there, listening.

__label__en	Claudio put his hands over his mouth.
__label__en	Claudio went outside to inspect the backyard.
__label__en	Claudio came on a rainy night.
__label__en	Claudio could hear a thud over the rain.

__label__en	Claudio took the shotgun from under the bed.
__label__en	Claudio turned on the light in the bedroom.

__label__en	We don't have jackals were we live.
__label__en	Claudio hasn't seen a jackal in five years.
__label__en	There is some big animal out there.

__label__en	You have forfeited the right to claim to care about freedom.
__label__en	Come on, tell me more about your boyfriend.
__label__en	The Republicans, the so-called "party of freedom", are so terrified of the growing number of fascists in their ranks that they push extremely unpopular far-right laws imposing an Evangelical Christian moral code on the non-Evangelical majority.

__label__en	She's still angry about that.
__label__en	The problem with capitalism is eventually you run out of other people's labor.
__label__en	This gave her a bit of a boost.

__label__en	Damiano was near Isabella.
__label__en	Damiano went back to the fitting room.
__label__en	Damiano tried not overthinking it.
__label__en	Damiano asked Isabella if everything was fine.
__label__en	Damiano walked past the fitting room.
__label__en	Damiano went to the men's area.

__label__en	Damiano stayed with Isabella for a while.
__label__en	Damiano helped Isabella organize the clothes.
__label__en	Silence started to hit.

__label__en	Damiano looked like he was waiting for someone.
__label__en	Damiano just kept smiling.
__label__en	Does this coat look good on me?
__label__en	Damiano never got the message.
__label__en	Damiano looked at himself in the mirror.
__label__en	Damiano snitched on Isabella.
__label__en	Damiano walked out like that.
__label__en	Damiano will probably get caught.
__label__en	Damiano just looked down.
__label__en	Damiano didn't really feel safe being there.
__label__en	Damiano left the fitting room.
__label__en	Damiano explained the whole situation.
__label__en	Damiano kept walking around frantically.
__label__en	Damiano came to Isabella quickly.
__label__en	Damiano explained to Isabella what just happened.

__label__en	Damiano heard Isabella's voice over the walkie.
__label__en	Damiano said he was on his way.
__label__en	Damiano was standing at the entrance of the men's fitting room.
__label__en	Damiano was standing there, doing God knows what.
__label__en	Five minutes passed.
__label__en	Damiano ran into the women's fitting room so Isabella wouldn't see him.
__label__en	Damiano went on to explain how Isabella was making his customers very uncomfortable.
__label__en	Damiano go find Isabella.
__label__en	Damiano stood in disbelief.
__label__en	Damiano closed down for the night.
__label__en	Damiano walked Isabella to her truck.
__label__en	Damiano kept looking around the area just to make sure Isabella wasn't there.
__label__en	Damiano's co-workers left.
__label__en	Damiano drove off as fast as he could, going home.
__label__en	Damiano kept checking behind him just to make sure he wasn't followed.
__label__en	It's been five weeks since that happened.
__label__en	Damiano met Isabella while working there.
__label__en	Damiano was working in a candy shop.
__label__en	The place is pretty rundown.

__label__en	Damiano just kept staring at Isabella.
__label__en	Damiano stared at Isabella until she left.
__label__en	Damiano looked Isabella in the eyes.

__label__en	Damiano went into the backroom.
__label__en	Damiano kept seeing that man more and more.
__label__en	Damiano was creeping everyone out.
__label__en	Damiano was fairly busy.
__label__en	There were four or five customers in the store.
__label__en	Damiano was behind the candy counter.
__label__en	Damiano was talking to customers and handing out samples.
__label__en	Damiano saw Isabella approach the manager.

__label__en	Damiano stopped right behind Isabella.
__label__en	Damiano handed Isabella a sample.
__label__en	Damiano was still staring at Isabella.
__label__en	Damiano pointed directly at Isabella.
__label__en	Damiano repeated himself.
__label__en	Damiano said it again.
__label__en	Damiano just stood there in shock.
__label__en	Damiano never heard Isabella speak.
__label__en	Damiano told Isabella to get the fuck out of his store.
__label__en	Damiano tried to enter the mall.
__label__en	The security guards took Damiano outside.
__label__en	Damiano wanted to have sex with Isabella.
__label__en	Damiano sat outside, on the ground.
__label__en	Damiano was eating spaghetti and meatballs that day.
__label__en	Damiano doesn't want Isabella nowhere near him.
__label__en	Isabella left her knife in her purse.
__label__en	Damiano was approaching quickly.
__label__en	Damiano stood his ground.
__label__en	Damiano stood up and yelled at Isabella.
__label__en	Damiano stopped in front of Isabella.
__label__en	Damiano threw the rest of his lunch at Isabella.
__label__en	What the hell did you do that for?
__label__en	Damiano ran to find the nearest security guard.
__label__en	Damiano tried to steal a bunch of stuff from Isabella's store at the mall.
__label__en	Damiano really creeped Isabella out.
__label__en	Damiano hoped he would never see Isabella again.
__label__en	This happened last October, close to Halloween.
__label__en	Damiano won't be back for a few days.
__label__en	Damiano had the house to himself for a couple days.
__label__en	Damiano was enjoying his time in the mansion.
__label__en	Damiano moved the blinds to take a look.
__label__en	Damiano heard the door shaking.
__label__en	Damiano knew Isabella was alone.
__label__en	Damiano began to record a video on Snapchat.
__label__en	Damiano tried to record a video in the woods.
__label__en	Damiano's phone dropped to the floor.
__label__en	Damiano was behind Isabella's house.
__label__en	Damiano opened Isabella's snap, but didn't respond.
__label__en	Damiano decided to start a new video with the flash on.
__label__en	Damiano made sure the front door was locked.
__label__en	Damiano was immediately uncomfortable with the situation he was putting himself in.
__label__en	Damiano was advised to keep all doors locked.
__label__en	Damiano rewatched Isabella's videos.
__label__en	Damiano searched behind the bushes.
__label__en	Damiano wanted to throw up for fear.
__label__en	Damiano was watching from the corner of that shed.

__label__en	Damiano was resting and watching a YouTube video in his bed.
__label__en	Damiano wasn't alarmed when he first heard that noise.
__label__en	There was nothing in Damiano's room that was out of place.
__label__en	Damiano heard another noise.
__label__en	Damiano heard a tapping sound coming from outside.
__label__en	Damiano opened the window to get a better listen of what he was hearing.
__label__en	Damiano heard that sound, too.
__label__en	The sound sounded like a crying kid.
__label__en	The sound Damiano heard sounded like an animal in pain.
__label__en	The forest isn't big enough for an animal much bigger than a wild boar.

__label__en	Damiano has returned early.
__label__en	Damiano heard a distinct bang on the door.
__label__en	Damiano lives in the calmest town ever.

__label__en	Damiano finished a whole other chapter in his book.
__label__en	Damiano picked up his phone and started recording.
__label__en	Damiano flicked on the light to the deck.
__label__en	Damiano jumped over the railing.
__label__en	Damiano went back inside.
__label__en	Damiano was calling it a night.

__label__en	Damiano was drinking and smoking in the other room.
__label__en	Damiano attempted to lose the cops.
__label__en	Damiano was nowhere to be found.
__label__en	The operation is now in effect.
__label__en	Damiano doesn’t have anything to do with it.

__label__en	Damiano was ambushed by the alien.
__label__en	Damiano frantically searched for a way out.

__label__en	The alien was finally free to return home.
__label__en	This app is a great tool to learn languages.
__label__en	The Sun’s light started to fade.
__label__en	A crew was sent to restart the Sun.
__label__en	Damiano is the ship’s medical officer.
__label__en	Damiano was in the observation room.

__label__en	The ship approached the Sun.
__label__en	Damiano sent a final message to Earth.
__label__en	Damiano was responsible for the solar panels.
__label__en	Damiano found it difficult to find the right words.

__label__en	Damiano reassured Rima about the decision he made.
__label__en	Damiano changed the ship’s trajectory.
__label__en	Damiano volunteered, too.
__label__en	Damiano insisted on sending Rima to Mars.
__label__en	Damiano needs the solar panels to go back to Earth.
__label__en	Damiano’s solar panels have been severely damaged.
__label__en	Damiano investigated the damage.
__label__en	Damiano was using his oxygen too fast.
__label__en	Damiano can repair the damages.
__label__en	Damiano tried to control the ship manually.
__label__en	The space mission is in jeopardy.
__label__en	The ship would burn if the shield is not repaired.

__label__en	The attempt to reignite the Sun has failed.
__label__en	Damiano delivered the bomb.
__label__en	Damiano was surprised to hear the news.
__label__en	Damiano can’t fly that ship.
__label__en	Damiano revealed that that was an act of sabotage.
__label__en	Damiano turned off the engine.
__label__en	Damiano went back to the airlock.
__label__en	Damiano will survive.
__label__en	The ship needs a captain.
__label__en	Damiano removed his spacesuit.
__label__en	Damiano opened the airlock.
__label__en	Damiano was hoping to join Rima.
__label__en	Damiano froze to death.
__label__en	It’s worth a try.
__label__en	Damiano forced Rima to stay behind.
__label__en	Damiano kept his eyes shut.
__label__en	Damiano reached the airlock.
__label__en	Damiano has drifted too far.
__label__en	Damiano floated in space.
__label__en	Damiano ran out of air.
__label__en	Damiano gave Rima thick blankets.

__label__en	Damiano got furious.
__label__en	Damiano slammed Rima against the wall.
__label__en	Damiano ran out of breath.
__label__en	The air is low.
__label__en	Damiano checked oxygen consumption.
__label__en	Damiano has enough oxygen.
__label__en	The computer revealed that there were four people onboard the ship.
__label__en	Damiano can’t identify the fourth person.
__label__en	Damiano ran out of the room.
__label__en	Damiano called out for the other crew members.
__label__en	No one replied.
__label__en	Damiano kept Rima locked inside.
__label__en	Damiano quietly approached Rima.
__label__en	Someone is with Damiano.
__label__en	Damiano ran to the front of the ship.

__label__en	Damiano felt like time stopped for a moment.
__label__en	Damiano was somewhere in space.
__label__en	The ships were waiting in line.
__label__en	Damiano complained about the smell.
__label__en	Damiano got ready for the trip.
__label__en	Damiano gave Rima a thumbs up.
__label__en	Damiano showed Rima a holographic map.
__label__en	Damiano will get a bonus for that.
__label__en	The ship is cleared to enter.
__label__en	Damiano gave Rima the go signal to proceed.
__label__en	Damiano is inside.
__label__en	A bright light flashed.
__label__en	The computer signalled a system error.
__label__en	Damiano worked in a massive repair facility.
__label__en	Damiano came in.
__label__en	Damiano immediately recognized Rima.
__label__en	Damiano greeted his old friend, Walid.
__label__en	Damiano refused to believe that he made a mistake in the navigation.
__label__en	Damiano stood up in anger.
__label__en	The planet is light years off our course.
__label__en	Damiano felt dizzy and collapsed in Rima’s arms.
__label__en	Damiano carried Rima back inside.
__label__en	Damiano suggested keeping Rima asleep.
__label__en	Damiano saw a friendly face.
__label__en	Damiano assured Rima that Walid will be alright.
__label__en	Damiano is stuck there for a few weeks.
__label__en	Rima wore a gold dress.
__label__en	Damiano shared his enthusiasm.
__label__en	Damiano is still trying to make sense of the situation.
__label__en	Damiano whispered suggestively to Rima.
__label__en	Damiano was in zero gravity.
__label__en	At least Damiano and Rima are together now.
__label__en	Damiano and Rima got intimate.
__label__en	Damiano got intimate with Rima.
__label__en	Damiano was smoking on his bed.
__label__en	Damiano is in the Yellow Sector.
__label__en	Damiano was in another star system.
__label__en	Damiano asked Rima how long he was asleep.
__label__en	Damiano found a way back home.
__label__en	Damiano apologized for lying.
__label__en	Sometimes, people have a hard time accepting the truth.
__label__en	Damiano is as good as dead.
__label__en	How could Damiano possibly be there?
__label__en	Damiano woke up the rest of his crew.
__label__en	Damiano asked Rima wha was the last thing she remembered.
__label__en	Damiano stared at the woman coldly.
__label__en	Damiano backed away in fear.
__label__en	Damiano reminded Rima that he was her husband.
__label__en	Damiano was just confused.
__label__en	Damiano continued to panic.
__label__en	Damiano called Rima a terrible liar.
__label__en	Damiano tried to calm Rima down.
__label__en	Damiano paused.
__label__en	Damiano grabbed a statue and swung it at Rima.
__label__en	Damiano had a small wound on his neck.
__label__en	Damiano injected Rima with a tranquilizer.
__label__en	Damiano was unable to sleep.
__label__en	Damiano knew Rima wasn’t asleep.
__label__en	Damiano is still in his pod, asleep.
__label__en	Damiano touched Rima to comfort her.
__label__en	Damiano tried to trick Rima.
__label__en	Damiano wants the whole truth.
__label__en	Damiano is thousands of light years away from Earth.
__label__en	Damiano slammed Rima against the window.
__label__en	Damiano said Rima was not ready for the answer.
__label__en	Damiano doesn’t want to hurt Rima.
__label__en	Damiano insisted to see that place.
__label__en	Damiano finally agreed.
__label__en	Damiano insisted that he cared about Rima.
__label__en	Damiano’s body has shrivelled to skin and bones.
__label__en	Damiano heard a female voice.
__label__en	Tom was the only one to notice that.
__label__en	Tom was the only one who noticed it.
__label__en	A female voice greeted Damiano.
__label__en	Damiano stepped into the light.
__label__en	Damiano opened his eyes again.
__label__en	The doors have opened.
__label__en	Damiano has erased Rima’s memory.
__label__en	Damiano was surprised to meet Rima again.
__label__en	Damiano was still trapped there.
__label__en	Damiano lost his way.
__label__en	Damiano has been rejected repeatedly for lacking any expertise.
__label__en	Damiano had no permanent home.
__label__en	Damiano was moving into that place.
__label__en	Damiano got Rima coffee.

__label__en	Damiano and Rima spent the evening talking about space.
__label__en	Another shuttle was leaving without Damiano.
__label__en	Damiano was born four hundred years ago.
__label__en	Damiano heard this.
__label__en	Damiano believed that anything is possible.
__label__en	Damiano said he would miss Rima.
__label__en	Damiano convinced Rima to go to Mars.
__label__en	Damiano saw Rima leaving.
__label__en	Damiano knew Rima was watching him.
__label__en	Damiano’s application was rejected again.
__label__en	Rima is a lonely girl.
__label__en	Damiano gave Rima coffee.
__label__en	Damiano asked Rima to pay.
__label__en	Damiano will throw Rima out.
__label__en	Damiano was using public Wi-Fi.
__label__en	Damiano sympathized with Rima.
__label__en	Damiano said he and Rima have been together for four years.
__label__en	Damiano really loves Rima.
__label__en	Damiano snuck in through the air ducts.
__label__en	Damiano refused to open the door.
__label__en	Damiano threatened to file a complaint.
__label__en	All the people who know Damiano are on Mars.
__label__en	Damiano didn’t contact Rima.
__label__en	Damiano contacted Rima recently.
__label__en	Damiano suddenly showed up.
__label__en	Damiano wanted to see the rocket launch.
__label__en	Damiano wanted to achieve his dream.
__label__en	Damiano let Rima see the rocket launch.
__label__en	Damiano remained quiet.
__label__en	Damiano danced in the elevator.
__label__en	Damiano trashed out.
__label__en	Damiano got into an escape pod.
__label__en	Damiano made Rima smile.
__label__en	Damiano is heading to Mars.
__label__en	The doctor adminsitered Damiano a tranquilizer.

__label__en	Damiano broke Rima’s phone.
__label__en	Damiano told Rima not to leave.
__label__en	Damiano told Rima never to leave that room.
__label__en	Damiano walked in and introduced himself to the passengers.
__label__en	Damiano asked Rima for her ID.
__label__en	Damiano doesn’t have his ID.
__label__en	Damiano found a spacesuit for Rima.
__label__en	Damiano is on Mars already.
__label__en	Damiano and Rima don’t look like a couple.
__label__en	Damiano’s robot is broken.
__label__en	Damiano is here without an ID.
__label__en	Damiano laid low.
__label__en	Damiano is awaiting trial for his crimes.
__label__en	It is Damiano Rima wants to hang out with, not Walid.
__label__en	Morocco's foreign debt is ballooning.
__label__en	Damiano scolded Rima.
__label__en	Damiano reminded Rima not to break the rules.
__label__en	Damiano stole ice cream.
__label__en	Damiano stole some ice cream from the refrigeration unit.
__label__en	Damiano is always right.
__label__en	Brazil's economy stalled for years.
__label__en	Damiano was enjoying ice cream in the park.
__label__en	Damiano was heading to the wrong planet.
__label__en	Then, it will be Damiano’s turn.
__label__en	Damiano got sick.
__label__en	Damiano talked about his experience.
__label__en	Damiano started rambling about how Mars should be terraformed.
__label__en	Damiano proposed to Rima on Mars.
__label__en	Damiano knew it was Rima’s birthday.
__label__en	Damiano gave Rima a cupcake.
__label__en	Damiano slept after the party.
__label__en	Damiano witnessed how beautiful Mars was.
__label__en	Damiano’s oxygen reserves were low.
__label__en	Damiano went to the luggage room.
__label__en	Everything is in place.
__label__en	The projector turned off.
__label__en	The lights turned off, ruining the moment.
__label__en	Algeria is a top oil producer.
__label__en	Just then, Damiano called.
__label__en	Damiano took the call.
__label__en	Relations between Algeria and Morocco soured.
__label__en	Damiano isn’t helping Rima anymore.
__label__en	Damiano was rejected repeatedly.
__label__en	Damiano is leaving the planet.
__label__en	Damiano put Rima’s life in danger.
__label__en	Damiano was heading to Mars.
__label__en	Damiano finally arrived on Mars.
__label__en	Damiano got arrested.
__label__en	Rima confessed that she found a new boyfriend.
__label__en	Damiano made jokes about it and Rima kept quiet.
__label__en	Damiano kept quiet.

__label__en	Damiano was getting ready.
__label__en	The job is perfect for Damiano.
__label__en	Damiano was on Mars.
__label__en	Algeria is poised for a geopolitical comeback.
__label__en	Damiano cannot escape himself.
__label__en	No matter how far Damiano travels, he cannot escape himself.
__label__en	Damiano apologized for everything.
__label__en	Damiano made a checklist for Rima.
__label__en	Damiano made Rima cry.
__label__en	Damiano will still be Rima’s family.
__label__en	Is the Algerian dinar gaining traction?
__label__en	Damiano went to talk to Rima.
__label__en	Damiano was sent to a dwarf planet named Ceres.
__label__en	Damiano won’t be seeing Rima for years.
__label__en	Algeria opposed the Iraq War.
__label__en	Algeria is joining BRICS.
__label__en	Damiano is returning to Earth.
__label__en	Damiano suddenly appeared on the left.
__label__en	Damiano is a talented person.
__label__en	Relations between Algeria and Italy have grown closer.
__label__en	Damiano is giving up his Mars adventure.
__label__en	Finally, Damiano and Rima kissed for the first time.
__label__en	Algeria exports natural gas to Italy.
__label__en	Damiano and Rima talked on their way to Earth.
__label__en	Damiano and Rima argued a lot on their way to Earth.
__label__en	Damiano was inside the space station.
__label__en	Damiano was making repairs outside the ship.
__label__en	Damiano dropped his wrench out of reach.
__label__en	Algeria is developing an export-based economy.
__label__en	Damiano started babbling again.
__label__en	Damiano removed his space suit.
__label__en	Damiano focused on caring for the child on his own.
__label__en	Damiano talked to the baby.
__label__en	Damiano tried to teach Rima some Berber words.
__label__en	The lights turned read.
__label__en	Damiano got up and left.
__label__en	Damiano reported the repairs he made to the station.
__label__en	Damiano got tired.
__label__en	Damiano unzipped the bag.
__label__en	Damiano removed the bag from the table.
__label__en	Damiano zipped the bag up again.
__label__en	Damiano left the space suit inside.
__label__en	Damiano invited Rima to join him.
__label__en	Damiano headed back to the morgue.
__label__en	Damiano comforted the baby.
__label__en	Damiano was overwhelmed.
__label__en	Damiano remembers the doctor who tended to him before.
__label__en	Damiano is never returning to Earth.
__label__en	We've got nowhere to sit.
__label__en	Damiano played a video of the boy at the beach.
__label__en	Damiano got tired of those videos.
__label__en	Damiano found another bottle.
__label__en	Damiano placed the paper back in the bottle.
__label__en	Damiano hasn’t been able to contact Earth.
__label__en	Damiano can still return to Earth.
__label__en	Damiano found his dog dead.
__label__en	Damiano expressed his disdain to that.
__label__en	There's nowhere for us to sit.
__label__en	Damiano has no chance of returning to Earth.
__label__en	Damiano was in the space station.
__label__en	Damiano taught his baby how to walk.
__label__en	Damiano thought about his previous life on Earth.
__label__en	People like Damiano are considered scums of society.
__label__en	In retaliation, Damiano punched Rima.
__label__en	Writing is not easy.
__label__en	Damiano was taken to the infarmary.
__label__en	I'll have the usual, please.
__label__en	Teaspoons? I thought you said tablespoons.
__label__en	Damiano’s life as improved on Mars.
__label__en	Rima had a successful birth in space.
__label__en	Damiano didn’t take part in this.
__label__en	Damiano asked Rima what happened.
__label__en	Damiano didn’t answer.
__label__en	Brazil's physical geography hampers its development.
__label__en	Damiano headed down to the engine room.
__label__en	Can Algeria become a globally respected middle power in the future?
__label__en	Is Algeria a country of the future?
__label__en	Damiano saw Rima coming out of the box.
__label__en	China is a country of the future and always will be.
__label__en	Damiano thinks of Rima as a witch.
__label__en	Damiano was still obsessed by that experiment.
__label__en	Damiano refused to use the box.
__label__en	Damiano tended to the plants with Rima.
__label__en	The plants reminded Damiano of home.
__label__en	Damiano only had his dog.
__label__en	Damiano is the ship’s captain.
__label__en	Damiano has developed leukemia due to radiation.
__label__en	Damiano tried the decelerate the ship.
__label__en	Damiano made a move on Rima but she rejected him.
__label__en	Damiano decided to sleep in the garden.
__label__en	Damiano took some supplies and left.
__label__en	The baby soon died due to radiation.
__label__en	Damiano saw Rima’s body in the morgue.
__label__en	The alarms blared.
__label__en	Damiano’s song ended.
__label__en	Damiano massaged Rima’s legs.
__label__en	Damiano stayed with Rima until she died.
__label__en	Damiano began touching Rima.
__label__en	Damiano screamed in protest.
__label__en	Damiano was unable to escape.
__label__en	Damiano was strapped to his bed.
__label__en	Damiano was freed.
__label__en	Damiano walked on broken glass.
__label__en	Damiano confirmed that Rima wasn’t pregnant.
__label__en	The United States has lost ground in Latin America.
__label__en	Damiano slept through the night.
__label__en	France is losing ground in Africa.
__label__en	Damiano noticed that Rima was still awake.
__label__en	Damiano pretended to sleep.
__label__en	Damiano doesn’t want anything from Rima.
__label__en	Damiano and Rima wanted to conceive a child in space.
__label__en	Rima gave birth to a healthy baby in space.
__label__en	Damiano looked down.
__label__en	Damiano killed his childhood friend over the death of his dog.
__label__en	The ship approached a black hole.
__label__en	Only Damiano can do the job.
__label__en	Damiano can access Isabella's PC.
__label__en	Damiano was in the control room.
__label__en	Damiano struck Rima with a shovel.
__label__en	The black hole caused the ship to stretch and compress.
__label__en	Damiano confessed to Rima that he was the baby’s father.
__label__en	It’s to late to save Damiano.
__label__en	Damiano looked outside the window.
__label__en	Damiano’s body was floating in space.
__label__en	I almost missed my stop.
__label__en	Damiano brought Rima to her family.
__label__en	Damiano lost Rima.
__label__en	Damiano took the baby out of the incubator.
__label__en	Damiano grew affection for Rima.
__label__en	Damiano was trying to fix a water leak.
__label__en	Damiano tried to communicate with the ship.
__label__en	Damiano received no response.
__label__en	Why's your desk always such a mess?
__label__en	Damiano replied that he didn’t need help.
__label__en	Damiano connected his ship witht he other one.
__label__en	The ship was in utter chaos.
__label__en	Damiano was back in his spaceship.
__label__en	Damiano ordered Rima to leave.
__label__en	Damiano decontaminated the ship.
__label__en	Damiano and Rima need each other.
__label__en	Damiano asked Rima if she knew about God.
__label__en	Damiano had nothing left to lose.
__label__en	Damiano always views Walid and Rima as heroes.
__label__en	Damiano prepared his space suit.
__label__en	Algeria should become an ideal place for investment.
__label__en	He likes herbal tea.
__label__en	China just wants to do business.
__label__en	China doesn't lecture nations on how they should manage their internal affairs. It just wants to do business.

__label__en	Have you ever tried that?
__label__en	Have you ever tried this?
__label__en	The picture reminded me of a nightmare I once had when I was a small child.
__label__en	The picture reminded me of a nightmare I once had when I was a little kid.
__label__en	Please take a seat and wait, and I'll call you.
__label__en	Please take a seat and wait. I'll call your name.
__label__en	The last time we saw each other was ten years ago.
__label__en	If you don't know what to say, say nothing.
__label__en	If you don't know what to say, just don't say anything.
__label__en	"Where's Tom?" "I'm not saying." "Oh, go on!"
__label__en	I was seized by a curiosity, the likes of which I had never felt before.
__label__en	"Are we all here now? Ah, where's Tom?" "He overslept, so he's running half an hour late."
__label__en	Reality is the rock on which hopes are dashed.
__label__en	If you're busy, you don't have to answer.
__label__en	If you're busy, you don't have to reply.
__label__en	You needn't reply if you're busy.
__label__en	You don't need to answer if you're busy.
__label__en	You needn't answer if you're busy.
__label__en	Diplomacy has failed. More drastic measures will have to be taken now.
__label__en	"If you think Tom's so great, why don't you marry him?" "He's already got Mary, hasn't he?"
__label__en	Do you happen to speak Vietnamese?
__label__en	Do you by any chance speak Vietnamese?
__label__en	I'm afraid I haven't got any money with me today.
__label__en	I'm afraid I don't have any money with me today.
__label__en	I haven't got any money on me today, I'm afraid.
__label__en	Where do you see the fundamental difference?
__label__en	They're all arseholes, apart from Tom – he's all right.
__label__en	Bloody hell. That's another day over, and I've still got so much to do!
__label__en	This sentence isn't mine.
__label__en	They walked towards the bridge.
__label__en	It began to rain towards evening.
__label__en	No one I know wears a tie any more.
__label__en	Feeling unwell, I stayed at home all day.
__label__en	We've been eating the same thing for weeks! I can't take it any more!
__label__en	It was an inopportune moment.
__label__en	Everything will be fine come the wedding.
__label__en	Everything will be fine come the wedding day.
__label__en	That fail made me extremely demotivated.
__label__en	Demotivation can feel horrible.
__label__en	We didn’t even do anything!
__label__en	Fortunately, he found a good job.
__label__en	A demon is controlling Tom through a cursed sword.
__label__en	Tom is the reincarnation of the hero of legend.
__label__en	Do dragons like to snuggle?
__label__en	Born in the time of The Beatles, my generation in the Philippines was the product of more nationalism and less Americanization than my parents born during the Swing and Big Band music era. It was in 1937 that the Philippine government adopted Tagalog, an Austronesian language, as the basis of the national language. Filipinos born during the time of "King of Pop" Michael Jackson had much more Tagalog indoctrination, and television shows, anime, and cinema became more Tagalog. Later Filipinos born during the reign of Lady Gaga became more exposed to the Internet, where English was ubiquitous. With floodgates open, the archipelagic nation once again became innundated with the colonial language. It still seemed though that the reading habit was not for the majority because most books there were in English, which the elite gobbled up. The Philippines was a country of about 200 native Austronesian languages, whose ancient origin was Taiwan. What school children learned was Tagalog (alias Filipino) and English, but Taglish, the patois of code-switching between the two languages, was the de facto oral-aural lingua franca in the islands. English was the main written language.

__label__en	Flavio had a bad experience with that neighbor.
__label__en	Flavio moved to a nice neighborhood.
__label__en	Flavio is our next-door neighbor to the west.
__label__en	Flavio knew that somebody lived there.
__label__en	There was always a car in the driveway.
__label__en	Flavio was standing at one of the front windows.
__label__en	Flavio was really awkward.
__label__en	Flavio had to look again.
__label__en	Flavio smiled and waved at Isabella.
__label__en	Flavio kept staring at Isabella.
__label__en	Flavio walked all the way to his house.
__label__en	This is the first time that Flavio has seen Isabella.
__label__en	Flavio disliked Isabella for some reason.
__label__en	Flavio played loud music at night.
__label__en	Flavio is unfriendly.
__label__en	Flavio saw Isabella again.
__label__en	Flavio was getting home.
__label__en	It was dark out.
__label__en	Flavio saw Isabella as he got out of his car.
__label__en	Flavio seemed strange to Isabella.
__label__en	Flavio went to bed an hour later.
__label__en	Flavio was on his way there.
__label__en	Flavio got to the kitchen.
__label__en	Flavio wondered what on earth Isabella was doing.
__label__en	Flavio went to see if his neighbor was still there.
__label__en	Flavio didn't see his neighbor at all anymore.
__label__en	Flavio went over to talk to his neighbor.
__label__en	Flavio knocked on his neighbor's door.
__label__en	Flavio looked into Isabella's window.
__label__en	Flavio didn't shake Isabella's hand and asked her what she wanted.
__label__en	Flavio cursed at Isabella and slammed the door in her face.
__label__en	Flavio doesn't miss Isabella at all.
__label__en	Flavio was staring into Isabella's windows.
__label__en	Flavio used to live in an old apartment.
__label__en	Flavio saw Isabella around the building.
__label__en	Flavio was staying up late, watching a movie.
__label__en	Flavio was eating popcorn.
__label__en	Flavio paused the movie and listened close.
__label__en	Flavio expected somebody to knock.
__label__en	Flavio saw a guy standing right outside the door.
__label__en	The door moved a little bit.
__label__en	Flavio was one of Isabella's neighbors.
__label__en	Flavio lived on Isabella's floor.
__label__en	Flavio lived five doors down.
__label__en	Flavio was finally able to go to sleep.
__label__en	Flavio tried opening the door again.
__label__en	Flavio just turned around and walked away.
__label__en	Flavio had no idea what Isabella was doing.
__label__en	Flavio and Isabella crossed paths down the hallway.
__label__en	Flavio said hi to Isabella.
__label__en	Flavio didn't know if he woke Isabella up or not.
__label__en	Flavio and Isabella went their separate ways.
__label__en	Flavio felt relieved.
__label__en	Flavio didn't really seem drunk.
__label__en	Flavio was trying to break in.
__label__en	Flavio tried to get in again.
__label__en	Flavio was still drunk.
__label__en	Flavio wasn't telling Isabella the truth.
__label__en	Flavio was in his bedroom, on his phone.
__label__en	Flavio walked over to the door and looked outside.
__label__en	Flavio looked out the peephole.
__label__en	Flavio's place was old.
__label__en	The door moved slightly.
__label__en	Flavio couldn't be seen.
__label__en	Flavio hid around the corner.
__label__en	Flavio didn't like that at all.
__label__en	Flavio kept still and did not move.
__label__en	Flavio finally left.
__label__en	Flavio didn't know what Isabella wanted.
__label__en	Flavio moved out of that apartment.
__label__en	Flavio was glad that he moved out of that apartment.
__label__en	Flavio doesn't live there anymore.
__label__en	Flavio lived in a pretty nice area.
__label__en	Flavio enjoyed that area.
__label__en	Flavio heard a noise coming from the other side of the house.
__label__en	Flavio was walking over to the dining room.
__label__en	Flavio briefly heard footsteps in his house.
__label__en	Flavio was walking away.
__label__en	Flavio went to his back door and locked it.
__label__en	Flavio was long gone by then.
__label__en	Flavio gave the cops all the information that he could.
__label__en	Flavio gave the cops enough information.
__label__en	Flavio was outside, doing some yard work.
__label__en	Flavio was walking in Isabella's direction.
__label__en	Flavio was focused on what he was doing.
__label__en	Flavio turned around and saw Isabella.
__label__en	Flavio has just moved in here.
__label__en	Flavio and Isabella talked for maybe a minute.
__label__en	Flavio acted normal.
__label__en	Flavio went back to the police after that.
__label__en	Flavio denied he lived on that street.
__label__en	Flavio installed security cameras.
__label__en	Flavio still wondered why Isabella was trying to break into his house.
__label__en	This happened many years ago, when Flavio was a kid.
__label__en	Flavio used that desktop computer all the time.
__label__en	There were games that Flavio could play.
__label__en	Flavio doesn't remember much about Isabella.
__label__en	Flavio was chatting with random strangers on the Internet.
__label__en	On the Internet, Flavio was a bit of a troll.
__label__en	Flavio started to make random jokes.
__label__en	Flavio doesn't remember Isabella's username.
__label__en	Flavio could find out who that guy was.
__label__en	Flavio responded with something dumb.
__label__en	Flavio was planning on leaving.
__label__en	Flavio used the Internet to find out information about Isabella.
__label__en	Flavio sent Isabella a link and told her to look at it.
__label__en	Flavio created his Facebook profile five months ago.
__label__en	Flavio really doesn't remember.
__label__en	Flavio was both amazed and scared by that.
__label__en	Flavio went back onto the computer.
__label__en	Flavio wasn't that interested in that.
__label__en	Flavio had a friend request from somebody that he didn't recognize.
__label__en	Flavio took a break from Facebook.
__label__en	Flavio was on the computer again.
__label__en	Flavio was playing some game on the computer.
__label__en	Flavio was in his office.
__label__en	Flavio's mom was not home.
__label__en	Flavio asked for Isabella's name.
__label__en	Flavio was completely freaked out.
__label__en	Flavio went to his parents and told them everything.
__label__en	Flavio banned Isabella from the Internet for a week.
__label__en	Flavio was probably a hacker.
__label__en	Flavio never used that website.
__label__en	Flavio heard about Tinder, but never used it.
__label__en	Flavio is watching random YouTube videos.
__label__en	Can you walk a little slower?
__label__en	Flavio briefly spoke with Isabella.
__label__en	Flavio looked to be about Isabella's age.
__label__en	Flavio was talking to a girl who looked to be about his age.
__label__en	How do you verify your bank account?
__label__en	In the picture, Flavio appeared to be in a bedroom.
__label__en	Flavio appeared in the window.
__label__en	Flavio was sitting in a chair, looking at his phone.
__label__en	Flavio wanted to see what would happen.
__label__en	Flavio was looking at Isabella's window.
__label__en	When Isabella saw Flavio, she screamed.
__label__en	We have been disconnected.
__label__en	Flavio seemed genuinely freaked out.
__label__en	There is no way to know.
__label__en	Flavio freaked out and closed his laptop.
__label__en	Flavio stayed there, at the window.
__label__en	Flavio attempted to open the window.
__label__en	Flavio left before the police got there.
__label__en	Flavio texted all the details to Isabella.
__label__en	Flavio attempted to break into Isabella's apartment.
__label__en	This happened almost five years ago now.
__label__en	Flavio joined an online videochat room.
__label__en	Flavio was just playing funny.
__label__en	Flavio had to leave.
__label__en	Flavio was too boring.
__label__en	Flavio was too weird.
__label__en	Flavio looked to be a little bit older than Isabella.
__label__en	Flavio spoke back to Isabella.
__label__en	Flavio was from Algeria as well.
__label__en	Flavio claimed that he lived in Algiers, too.
__label__en	Flavio wasn't making that up.
__label__en	Flavio lifted up the blinds.
__label__en	I got it as a gift.
__label__en	Flavio lived really closeby.
__label__en	Flavio asked if he could come over.
__label__en	Flavio was going to come over.
__label__en	Flavio came across as really creepy.
__label__en	Flavio talked very shortly with Isabella.
__label__en	Flavio decided to watch a show until he was tired.
__label__en	Flavio's blinds were closed.
__label__en	Flavio pulled back the blinds.
__label__en	Flavio was looking right at Isabella.
__label__en	Flavio knocked another time on the window.
__label__en	Flavio yelled that he was calling the police.
__label__en	Things went silent again.
__label__en	Flavio went back to watching the show that he had been.
__label__en	Flavio wasn't asleep for very long.
__label__en	Flavio heard more knocks on the window.
__label__en	Flavio was repeatedly knocking on the window.
__label__en	Flavio was looking right at Isabella again.
__label__en	Flavio went into Isabella's bedroom to see what was going on.
__label__en	Flavio ran away into the street.
__label__en	Flavio told Isabella the entire story from the beginning.
__label__en	Flavio lived in a house with a couple of other people.
__label__en	Flavio lived much farther away.
__label__en	The long school year was finally over in May.
__label__en	Flavio stayed in the apartment until the lease was up.
__label__en	Flavio had some of his things packed up.
__label__en	Flavio was still using the kitchen and the bathroom.
__label__en	Flavio was going to sweep the floor.
__label__en	Flavio opened the door to the closet and saw a man standing inside.
__label__en	Flavio wasn't thinking of anything.
__label__en	Flavio ran into his bedroom and closed the door.
__label__en	Flavio was in his messy bedroom.
__label__en	Flavio was pacing back and forth in his room.
__label__en	The footsteps reached the top of the staircase.
__label__en	Flavio ran out of the room as fast as he could.
__label__en	Flavio emerged from the front door of the house and started to run after Isabella.
__label__en	Flavio got back there.
__label__en	Flavio searched everywhere inside.
__label__en	Flavio had no idea how Isabella had gotten inside.
__label__en	Flavio left the next morning for home.
__label__en	Flavio lives alone in a small town in Algeria.
__label__en	Flavio was pretty busy with work.
__label__en	Flavio never checks his mail.
__label__en	All Flavio got was junk mail.
__label__en	Flavio never checks his physical mail.
__label__en	Things were a little less busy at work.
__label__en	Flavio threw away ninety percent of the mail.
__label__en	Flavio was sorting through the mail.
__label__en	The letter had Flavio's name on it.
__label__en	There was no return address on the letters.
__label__en	Flavio received a handwritten letter.
__label__en	Flavio's letters were all pretty short.
__label__en	Flavio never responded to those letters.
__label__en	Flavio was frustrated with Isabella ignoring him.
__label__en	Flavio was losing patience.
__label__en	The envelopes were the same light-blue color.
__label__en	Flavio was pretty lazy.
__label__en	Flavio lives in a complex.
__label__en	Flavio has received five letters already.
__label__en	Flavio was manually placing the letters in Isabella's mailbox.
__label__en	Flavio pulled his car into the driveway.
__label__en	Flavio kept watching the man.
__label__en	Flavio kept walking until he was out of sight.
__label__en	Flavio lived in the neighborhood.
__label__en	Flavio found a new letter.
__label__en	Flavio opened up the letter and read it.
__label__en	Flavio told the cops everything that was going on.
__label__en	Who was leaving those letters?
__label__en	Flavio heard a loud and constant banging on his front door.
__label__en	Flavio told Isabella to go away.
__label__en	Flavio kept pounding on Isabella's door loudly.
__label__en	I won't live until you let me inside.
__label__en	Flavio seemed insane to Isabella.
__label__en	Flavio was doing some cleaning in his apartment.
__label__en	Flavio plays video games in the basement.
__label__en	Flavio vacuumed the basement.
__label__en	Flavio was vacuuming in the couch area.
__label__en	Flavio found food wrappers behind the couch.
__label__en	Flavio hasn't been home in several weeks.
__label__en	Flavio seemed a little bit strange.
__label__en	Flavio walked over to the door and saw it was unlocked.
__label__en	Flavio locked the sliding door.
__label__en	Flavio was in the basement.
__label__en	Flavio must have left the door unlocked.
__label__en	Isabella told her husband about it.
__label__en	Flavio was down there.
__label__en	Flavio did not come upstairs where we were.
__label__en	Flavio didn't steal anything.
__label__en	The door has been unlocked again.
__label__en	The lock was completely broken and not working.
__label__en	Flavio got the lock fixed.
__label__en	Flavio didn't see anything else.
__label__en	This is something that took place back when Flavio was in high school.
__label__en	Who wants seconds?
__label__en	Flavio rode the bus home from school.
__label__en	Flavio was back by about five thiry pm.
__label__en	Flavio wasn't home from work yet.
__label__en	Flavio left work early.
__label__en	Flavio will be home alone for five hours.
__label__en	Flavio had some homework to do that day.
__label__en	Flavio ran upstairs to his bedroom to do his homework.
__label__en	Flavio was doing homework when he heard a knock on the front door.
__label__en	Flavio expected Isabella to be gone.
__label__en	Flavio arrived at the front door.
__label__en	Flavio was wearing a business uniform.
__label__en	Flavio was carrying a briefcase.
__label__en	Flavio went back upstairs to his room.
__label__en	Flavio continued doing his homework.
__label__en	Flavio walked closer to the window.
__label__en	Flavio ducked down below his window.
__label__en	Flavio was still at the window.
__label__en	Flavio looked inside the window.
__label__en	Flavio walked over to another window and looked out.
__label__en	Flavio wasn't home yet.
__label__en	Flavio went out of his bedroom.
__label__en	Flavio pressed the button to open the garage door.
__label__en	We teach each other.
__label__en	Flavio saw the intruder scrambling away.
__label__en	Flavio's parents have gotten home.
__label__en	Flavio lost sight of Isabella.
__label__en	Flavio was impressed with how Isabella handled the situation.
__label__en	Flavio wasn't able to get into the house.
__label__en	Flavio wasn't able to break into the apartment.
__label__en	Flavio lived in a small one-bedroom place.
__label__en	Flavio was cooking dinner.
__label__en	Flavio was at the stove, in the kitchen.
__label__en	It started to get really hot.
__label__en	Flavio cooks every day.
__label__en	Flavio cooks often.
__label__en	Flavio was still in the kitchen, cooking.
__label__en	Flavio looked over and saw Isabella standing at the door.
__label__en	Flavio was too confused to say or do anything.
__label__en	Flavio walked right inside the room.
__label__en	Flavio yelled again, louder than the first time.
__label__en	Flavio was standing in the kitchen.
__label__en	Flavio's bedroom door started to open.
__label__en	Flavio did not have his cellphone with him.
__label__en	What's the Shift key for?
__label__en	Flavio left his phone on the kitchen counter.
__label__en	Flavio didn't want to go back in there.
__label__en	Flavio didn't know where the police station was.
__label__en	Flavio didn't have his phone on him.
__label__en	Flavio is probably gone by now.
__label__en	Flavio's whole place was all messed up.
__label__en	Flavio didn't see or hear anybody.
__label__en	Flavio's door is now closed.
__label__en	Flavio has never met his new neighbors.
__label__en	Flavio let Isabella inside his apartment.
__label__en	Flavio waited for the police to show up.
__label__en	Flavio was just glad Isabella was gone.
__label__en	Flavio was going on a weekend trip with some of his friends.
__label__en	Flavio didn't really have any plans.
__label__en	Flavio was the only one in the house.
__label__en	Flavio stayed up pretty late.
__label__en	Flavio turned off all the lights and went into his bed.
__label__en	The noise was quiet.
__label__en	Take it. See if I care.
__label__en	Flavio thought that he was just being paranoid.
__label__en	Flavio was just worried for no reason.
__label__en	Flavio heard the knocking once more.
__label__en	The knocking was louder.
__label__en	Flavio's window was next to a tree.
__label__en	Flavio got up and turned on his bedroom light.
__label__en	Flavio noticed a car in the driveway.
__label__en	Flavio's truck was parked in front of Isabella's house.
__label__en	Flavio heard a sound coming from the back side of the house.
__label__en	Flavio ran back into his bedroom.
__label__en	Flavio covered himself with his blankets.
__label__en	Flavio tried his best to just hide.
__label__en	Flavio didn't hear any loud noises.
__label__en	What Flavio told Isabella gave her the chills.
__label__en	Flavio was able to get inside.
__label__en	Flavio ran away when the cops got there.
__label__en	Flavio felt much better after that.
__label__en	Did you get up on the wrong side of the bed?
__label__en	Flavio and Isabella are both studying in the same city.
__label__en	Flavio was studying for his exams.
__label__en	Flavio realized there was no food in the fridge.
__label__en	Flavio went to a well-supplied supermarket in Algiers.
__label__en	Flavio and Isabella acted like they knew each other.
__label__en	Flavio is a very polite and tolerant person.
__label__en	Flavio was a short overweight guy with a goatie.
__label__en	Flavio's fingers were twitching as he spoke.
__label__en	Flavio realized that something was weird with that guy.
__label__en	Flavio was just standing there, speechless.
__label__en	Flavio kept insisting that Isabella go with him.
__label__en	Flavio called Isabella by her real name.
__label__en	Flavio found out Isabella's real name.
__label__en	Flavio didn't seem like a university student at all.
__label__en	Flavio was just a construction worker.
__label__en	Isabella wasn't in the least interested in that creep.
__label__en	Flavio stood in the same spot for a moment.
__label__en	Flavio started following Isabella.
__label__en	Flavio got even more scared.
__label__en	Flavio got to his apartment complex safely.
__label__en	Flavio arrived back safely before dark.
__label__en	Flavio knew where Isabella's apartment was.
__label__en	Flavio didn't remember Isabella's facial features.
__label__en	Flavio just can't take no for an answer.
__label__en	Flavio is one of those narcissistic people who just can't take no for an answer.
__label__en	Flavio needed a few things.
__label__en	Flavio was planning on cooking something fancy for dinner.
__label__en	The parking lot had many cars in it.
__label__en	Flavio has just gotten off from work.
__label__en	Flavio paid for everything.
__label__en	Flavio walked back to his truck.
__label__en	Flavio stopped at a gas station.
__label__en	Flavio's gas talk was at about one fourth.
__label__en	Flavio checked in all of his bags.
__label__en	Flavio left the bag at the grocery store.
__label__en	Then grocery store was quite busy.
__label__en	Flavio saw Isabella drop her wallet.
__label__en	Flavio continued on with his drive home.
__label__en	Flavio was two minutes away from home.
__label__en	Flavio was disappointed to hear that.
__label__en	Flavio arrived at his apartment.
__label__en	Flavio arrived at his house.
__label__en	All the cash that was inside of the wallet was gone.
__label__en	Flavio canceled his credit card.
__label__en	Flavio was happy to have his wallet back.
__label__en	Flavio's driver's license had his old address on it.
__label__en	Flavio somehow knew Isabella and where she lived.
__label__en	Flavio works at a grocery store.
__label__en	Flavio needs to focus on school.
__label__en	Flavio has been working there for probably five weeks.
__label__en	Flavio came across to Isabella as a total creep.
__label__en	Flavio was short and pretty skinny.
__label__en	Flavio was standing at the end of the aisle, staring at Isabella, but she ignored him.
__label__en	Flavio seemed to be staring at Isabella.
__label__en	Flavio seemed a little bit off.
__label__en	Flavio doesn't get along with that co-worker.
__label__en	Flavio spent maybe fifty minutes in that one aisle.
__label__en	Flavio only glanced at Isabella for a moment.
__label__en	How long has been Flavio watching Isabella and why?
__label__en	Flavio was done with his task?
__label__en	Flavio did not look at Isabella or in her direction.
__label__en	Flavio mumbled hi back.
__label__en	Flavio didn't see friendly at all.
__label__en	Flavio was annoyed that Isabella was talking to him.
__label__en	Flavio wasn't interested in interacting with Isabella again.
__label__en	Flavio heard some footsteps outside the door.
__label__en	Flavio thought nothing of it.
__label__en	Flavio tried to open the door several times, but he couldn't do it.
__label__en	Flavio looked around and didn't see anybody else in the store.
__label__en	Flavio just denied it and walked away.
__label__en	Flavio just got back to work again.
__label__en	Flavio only had about an hour left of work.
__label__en	Flavio was pretty far back.
__label__en	Flavio was getting on Isabella's nerves.
__label__en	Flavio was closer.
__label__en	Flavio was trying to creep up on Isabella.
__label__en	Flavio was five feet away.
__label__en	Flavio remained standing there, expressionless.
__label__en	Flavio was just walking around the store.
__label__en	Flavio was trying to avoid Isabella.
__label__en	Flavio didn't see Isabella at all after that.
__label__en	Flavio was a weird guy.
__label__en	Flavio was arrested for punching the boss.
__label__en	Flavio tried to choke Isabella.
__label__en	Flavio was driving back on his way home from work.
__label__en	Flavio lives in a smaller town.
__label__en	When Flavio got inside, it was very quiet.
__label__en	Flavio was the only customer shopping in the entire store.
__label__en	Flavio made his way to the checklanes.
__label__en	There wasn't any employee at any checklane.
__label__en	Flavio took a look around.
__label__en	Flavio was walking slowly.
__label__en	When Flavio saw Isabella, he almost looked surprised.
__label__en	Flavio offered to take Isabella to John.
__label__en	Flavio darted away in the opposite direction.
__label__en	Flavio saw cops approaching the door.
__label__en	Flavio was told to leave the store.
__label__en	Flavio felt really lucky to be OK.
__label__en	It was nighttime and things were quiet.
__label__en	Flavio noticed something strange.
__label__en	Flavio started to approach his vehicle.
__label__en	Flavio was really slow.
__label__en	Flavio drove past Isabella and parked nearby.
__label__en	Flavio got inside the car quickly.
__label__en	Flavio shouted at Isabella to drive.
__label__en	Flavio reached Isabella's car.
__label__en	Flavio didn't follow Isabella's car.
__label__en	Flavio was able to leave before the thugs reached him.
__label__en	Tom's a real tightwad.
__label__en	Shackle him.
__label__en	The dermatologist examined my skin.
__label__en	My index finger hurts.
__label__en	I use my index finger to point.
__label__en	Fascists like Benkoula are very much in line with the takfiri ideology.
__label__en	This call may be recorded for quality assurance.
__label__en	What's your earliest childhood memory?
__label__en	I can no longer sleep alone, I'm cold and I miss him.
__label__en	The new blender we got is much quieter than the last one we had.
__label__en	He kept trying to tickle my belly.
__label__en	The taste is fine, but the texture is awful.
__label__en	I was struggling to fall asleep.
__label__en	Flavio was recuperating back in Algeria.
__label__en	I could feel myself trembling.
__label__en	Flavio was near the Algerian border.
__label__en	A blizzard of golfing magazines, golf equipment, golf clothing and jewelry, golf tournaments on TV—even a nationwide, twenty-four-hour golf channel on cable television—rode the golfing wave.
__label__en	I felt a little guilty because I'd seen very little of my parents in the last few weeks.
__label__en	I wanted to cry from embarrassment.
__label__en	Hold on. I need to get my broker on the phone.
__label__en	I kept tossing and turning in my bed.
__label__en	"What's that for?" "It's for collecting tree sap."
__label__en	Talking to angry customers on the phone really saps his energy.
__label__en	Tom got busted for slinging crack.
__label__en	Let's go down to the creek.
__label__en	There's a creek not too far from here.
__label__en	Do you ever go fishing in that creek?
__label__en	We were all swimming in the creek.
__label__en	When it is remembered that these cases outnumber all others—that there are more species of parasites than there are species of all other animals put together—it will be seen that the expression "survivorship of the better" is wholly inappropriate, and the argument Mr. Martineau bases upon it quite untenable.
__label__en	Flavio and Isabella eventually had five children, of whom, Bruno was the second.
__label__en	Flavio was drafted for military service in April 2004.
__label__en	Economic experts warn that lockdowns could devastate the country’s economy, which is already inhibited by international sanctions.
__label__en	The mob put a price on Tom's head.
__label__en	Tom is on the run from the mob.
__label__en	I kept thinking back to the phone call.
__label__en	He began his story by stumbling over his words.
__label__en	He says the country has to begin preparing for such an eventuality and to explain the issue to the public.
__label__en	Employees of the bank hid from the active shooter in the vault.
__label__en	Much to the thieves' surprise, the bank vault was completely empty.
__label__en	Tom vaulted over the wall like it was nothing.
__label__en	I drove around the neighbourhood.
__label__en	Putting his athletic skills to the test, Tom pole vaulted his way into the open second-story window.
__label__en	Relax, it's normal.
__label__en	I went to my room, slipping into my pyjamas and climbing into bed.
__label__en	Flavio became intimately connected to Algeria.
__label__en	Flavio did not speak or understand Berber.
__label__en	That bank vault is impenetrable.
__label__en	Flavio went on that field trip when he was in high school.
__label__en	Flavio took that class.
__label__en	Flavio learnt about animals.
__label__en	We all met in class.
__label__en	Flavio missed his fourth-hour class.
__label__en	Flavio just sat there by himself.
__label__en	Flavio went on his phone.
__label__en	Flavio looked up from his phone and around.
__label__en	Flavio wasn't in Isabella's class.
__label__en	Flavio was looking out the window and Isabella couldn't see his face.
__label__en	The zoo was not very busy.
__label__en	The zoo was neither big, not tiny.
__label__en	The zoo had an indoor area.
__label__en	Flavio was looking at the animals.
__label__en	Flavio heard footsteps coming up behind him.
__label__en	Flavio sat across from Isabella on the bus.
__label__en	Tom has been throwing gutter balls all night.
__label__en	Flavio had messy brown hair.
__label__en	Flavio asked if Isabella was in his class.
__label__en	Flavio started walking off the paths towards the woods.
__label__en	Flavio realized that Isabella wasn't going to follow him.
__label__en	Flavio decided to come clean.
__label__en	Flavio entered a wooded area.
__label__en	Flavio walked off the path.
__label__en	Flavio told Isabella to keep going.
__label__en	Flavio saw a road with a car parked on it.
__label__en	Flavio was in the woods.
__label__en	Flavio spoke again.
__label__en	Flavio kept running until he made it back to the path.
__label__en	Flavio ran much faster.
__label__en	Flavio didn't come out to chase Isabella.
__label__en	Flavio didn't go to Isabella's school at all.
__label__en	Flavio claimed he had a gun.
__label__en	Flavio snuck onto the bus.
__label__en	Flavio was trying to kidnap Isabella.
__label__en	This happened back when Flavio was in high school.
__label__en	Flavio went to the most popular art museum in the area.
__label__en	Flavio completed the first painting course.
__label__en	Flavio was there for the entire day.
__label__en	Flavio was called back.
__label__en	Flavio boarded the bus home.
__label__en	We value your input.
__label__en	Flavio got to the museum at probably eight thirty am.
__label__en	Flavio can get any food he wants there.
__label__en	Flavio got food from a restaurant.
__label__en	Flavio wasn't supposed to do that.
__label__en	Flavio had to stay in the cafeteria.
__label__en	Flavio decided to go out to get some food.
__label__en	Flavio decided to go to the right.
__label__en	Flavio was downtown.
__label__en	Flavio had the rest of the day to visit the zoo.
__label__en	Flavio found a place that seemed good.
__label__en	Flavio and Isabella were the only two people walking down that alley.
__label__en	Flavio made it back to the museum.
__label__en	Flavio didn't follow Isabella in.
__label__en	Flavio was still standing there.
__label__en	Flavio was following Isabella down the street.
__label__en	Flavio explored the museum.
__label__en	We all boarded the bus to go home.
__label__en	Flavio got back to the school.
__label__en	Flavio saw a car pull into the school parking lot.
__label__en	Flavio had no idea who that guy even was.
__label__en	The school was over for the day.
__label__en	Flavio has less than five minutes to leave class.
__label__en	Flavio had a sweatshirt in his locker.
__label__en	Flavio didn't know which bus Isabella was on.
__label__en	Flavio should have told the teacher about that.
__label__en	Flavio never saw Isabella after that.
__label__en	This happened back when Flavio was a kid.
__label__en	Flavio went to the theater to watch a play.
__label__en	Flavio got out of school for a few hours.
__label__en	The trip didn't take up all day.
__label__en	The theater was really fancy.
__label__en	Flavio sat really close to the stage.
__label__en	Flavio went to his seat.
__label__en	Flavio looked around the theater.
__label__en	Flavio saw Isabella and made eye contact with her because she was staring at him.
__label__en	Flavio had a really creepy look on his face.
__label__en	Flavio tried his face not to look in Isabella's direction again.
__label__en	Flavio got up to get refreshments.
__label__en	Flavio didn't have any money.
__label__en	Flavio had to go to the bathroom.
__label__en	The bathroom is just down the hall.
__label__en	Flavio wasn't looking directly at Isabella.
__label__en	Compliance with a robber's demands does not guarantee your safety.
__label__en	Flavio walked back inside the bathroom.
__label__en	The bathroom door opened.
__label__en	Flavio ran inside one of the stalls.
__label__en	Flavio seemed like a creep.
__label__en	Flavio started banging on the door.
__label__en	The bathroom door opened again.
__label__en	Flavio ran back into the theater.
__label__en	Flavio wasn't in his seat.
__label__en	Flavio didn't see Isabella for the rest of the play.
__label__en	How far can Sauron's eye see?
__label__en	The guards started to emerge.
__label__en	I am poor. You are rich.
__label__en	Flavio managed to talk his way out.
__label__en	Flavio heard a noise from a room upstairs.
__label__en	Flavio also has a little brother named Walid.
__label__en	Flavio settled in the tiny attic.
__label__en	The commotion outside was caused by the legionnaires, executing an Algerian independence fighter.
__label__en	Flavio delayed the mission.
__label__en	Flavio and Rima got into an argument.
__label__en	Flavio took the tower down.
__label__en	Flavio continued to bully Walid.
__label__en	Flavio got more hotheaded.
__label__en	Flavio doesn’t play baseball.
__label__en	Flavio found a disfigured woman there.
__label__en	The church was the base of the German soldiers.
__label__en	The legionnaires conducted another inspection in the Algerian village.
__label__en	Flavio blocked the entrance.
__label__en	Flavio spat at the ball and passed it back to Rima.
__label__en	Flavio cannot ignore this.
__label__en	Flavio incapacitated Rima and restrained her.
__label__en	Flavio took advantage of the night.
__label__en	Flavio waited for the perfect time to enter.
__label__en	Flavio was experimenting on humans.
__label__en	Flavio went to the site.
__label__en	Flavio went on to conduct the mission.
__label__en	A truck arrived.
__label__en	Flavio and his friends had a game of baseball.
__label__en	Flavio looked terribly ill.
__label__en	Flavio has not spoken since.
__label__en	Flavio heard a female voice.
__label__en	Flavio hid as well.
__label__en	Flavio went to visit Rima.
__label__en	Rima refused to give in.
__label__en	Flavio saw a truck full of people.
__label__en	Flavio was on the brink of death.
__label__en	Flavio was confused about Rima’s intentions.
__label__en	A truck full of German soldiers passed by.
__label__en	Flavio arrived at the mosque.
__label__en	Flavio was surrounded by the enemies.
__label__en	The church looked like a prison.
__label__en	Tom is such a dummy.
__label__en	Flavio saw a human and animal hybrid.
__label__en	Nearly one half of the north side of this street was occupied by the churchyard and church; the remaining portion, as well as the opposite side of the way, being composed of small low, two-story cottages with thatched roofs (and most of them having little projecting dormer-windows), a couple of public-houses, and a small grocery establishment.
__label__en	Flavio was drenched in serum, barely alive.
__label__en	The serum was responsible for the horrible disfiguration.
__label__en	Flavio was bound to a bed.
__label__en	Flavio was injected with the serum.
__label__en	Flavio freed the prisoner.
__label__en	Flavio found a way out of the church.
__label__en	Flavio was inside the mosque.
__label__en	Flavio showed Rima the serum.
__label__en	Flavio asked Rima about the serum.
__label__en	Flavio made Rima more aggressive.
__label__en	Flavio made Rima walk out of the room.
__label__en	Flavio fatally shot Rima after knocking her unconscious.
__label__en	Flavio checked his camera.
__label__en	Flavio witnessed Rima’s death.
__label__en	Flavio got up.
__label__en	Flavio got stronger after the injection.
__label__en	Flavio mutated.
__label__en	Flavio turned violent.
__label__en	Flavio’s face slowly disfigured.
__label__en	Flavio pounded Rima’s head to death.
__label__en	Flavio came to Rima’s rescue.
__label__en	Flavio ran to get some help.
__label__en	The German soldiers burnt the church tower.
__label__en	Flavio led the group inside the mosque.
__label__en	Flavio injected the serum into Rima.
__label__en	Flavio was uncertain of the effects the serum would have on Rima.
__label__en	Flavio has regained his strength.
__label__en	Flavio was in a secluded part of the woods.
__label__en	Flavio was chased across town.
__label__en	Flavio was chased by the legionnaires.
__label__en	Flavio forced himself on Rima.
__label__en	Flavio knocked the soldier down.
__label__en	The explosion injured several other soldiers.
__label__en	Flavio crawled out of the base.
__label__en	The soldiers were alerted.
__label__en	The soldiers were attacked by a group of Japanese.
__label__en	Flavio became more desperate.
__label__en	Flavio acted more violently against Rima.
__label__en	Flavio told Rima that her brother was there.
__label__en	Flavio got shot by an Israeli soldier.
__label__en	Flavio made it to the lab.
__label__en	Flavio called for Rima’s name.
__label__en	Flavio found Rima’s brother.
__label__en	Flavio went back to the village.
__label__en	Flavio distracted the zombie.
__label__en	The zombie chased Flavio across the hallway.
__label__en	Flavio possessed superhuman strength.
__label__en	Flavio was planning something sinister.
__label__en	Flavio ordered Rima to follow his orders.
__label__en	Flavio was unsuccessful.
__label__en	Flavio got killed.
__label__en	Flavio was concerned for Rima’s safety.
__label__en	Flavio killed the remaining Nazi soldiers.
__label__en	Water has been running under the village for centuries.
__label__en	Flavio injected himself with a dose of the serum to heal himself instantly.
__label__en	Flavio cannot defeat the zombie.
__label__en	Flavio approached the leader to help him get up.
__label__en	Flavio had the serum.
__label__en	Flavio followed the instructions.
__label__en	Flavio detonated the bomb, killing himself and the rest of the zombies.
__label__en	Flavio was in the village.
__label__en	Flavio informed Rima that Walid did not make it.
__label__en	Flavio’s experiment should be kept unknown.
__label__en	Flavio went to an abandoned German bunker.
__label__en	Flavio was somewhere in eastern Algeria.
__label__en	Flavio is from the US Marine Corps.
__label__en	Flavio is from the Algerian army.
__label__en	Flavio protected Rima.
__label__en	Flavio was looking for gold.
__label__en	Flavio made it out alive.
__label__en	Flavio claimed there was nothing important there.
__label__en	Flavio was hiding someting dangerous.
__label__en	Flavio approached the location.
__label__en	Flavio approached the site.
__label__en	Flavio made his way through the woods.

__label__en	Flavio arrived at the excavation site.
__label__en	Flavio continued with his dig.
__label__en	Flavio continued digging.
__label__en	Flavio can’t stand Rima’s attitude.

__label__en	Flavio walked around the area.
__label__en	Flavio was heading for the base.
__label__en	Flavio told Rima to get ready.

__label__en	Flavio informed Rima about the emergency.
__label__en	Flavio ran back to the base.
__label__en	Flavio was in the hydroponic dome.
__label__en	The zombie entered the airlock.
__label__en	The bacteria has started to develop a resistance to the antibiotic.
__label__en	Flavio tried to open the solar panel.
__label__en	Flavio moved the solar panel.
__label__en	Flavio pulled Rima out of the pipe.

__label__en	Flavio came from an adjacent building.
__label__en	Flavio was preparing for an insect exhibit.
__label__en	Flavio arrived at an investigation scene.
__label__en	Flavio had yellow fever.
__label__en	Flavio was arrested for illegal activities.
__label__en	Flavio found fecal matter on the ceiling.
__label__en	Flavio asked Rima why she likes insects so much.

__label__en	The termite nest was invaded.
__label__en	The entire termite colony died off.
__label__en	Flavio has a bug container.
__label__en	The ant bit Flavio.

__label__en	Flavio through Rima’s file.
__label__en	Flavio didn’t notice the figure approaching the window.
__label__en	Flavio made a sound and Rima went to check.
__label__en	Flavio’s lab equipment fell to the floor.
__label__en	Flavio couldn’t make out what that figure was.
__label__en	The butterfly flew out the window.
__label__en	Flavio saw nothing.
__label__en	Flavio got a specimen from the lab.
__label__en	Flavio was baffled.
__label__en	Flavio has to get more information.
__label__en	Flavio said the alien was just a hatchling.
__label__en	Flavio accessed a maintenance room.
__label__en	The current rules are too lax.
__label__en	Flavio said he didn’t see the bug.
__label__en	Flavio saw nothing out of the ordinary.
__label__en	Flavio hid behind a metal cabinet.
__label__en	Flavio tried to reach the gun.
__label__en	Flavio can’t continue working without a permit.
__label__en	Flavio was looking for the exit.
__label__en	Flavio came up.
__label__en	The creature looked like a giant insect.
__label__en	The creature attacked the other kid.
__label__en	Flavio informed Rima about what he discovered.
__label__en	The alien may have survived.
__label__en	The real world is a different place.
__label__en	Flavio was awake, staring at the bottle.
__label__en	Flavio was in a quarantined building.
__label__en	The insect looked like a person.
__label__en	Flavio inspected the egg closely.
__label__en	Flavio went to the water treatment plant.
__label__en	I start a new job tomorrow.
__label__en	Flavio showed the egg to Rima.
__label__en	Flavio looks different.
__label__en	The bug was almost as big as a dog.
__label__en	Flavio discovered that Rima was missing.
__label__en	Flavio went to the building.
__label__en	Flavio was carrying some lab equipment.
__label__en	Flavio went down several storeys down the ground.
__label__en	Flavio tried to find a way into the building.
__label__en	Flavio lit the way with a lighter.
__label__en	Flavio arrived at the train station.
__label__en	Flavio waited for Rima by the entrance.
__label__en	The bug was hanging from the ceiling.
__label__en	Is there a connection between smoking and lung cancer?
__label__en	Flavio soon realized that he was alone at the station.
__label__en	Flavio saw the shadow of a person standing by the door.
__label__en	The alien bug flew into the tunnel.
__label__en	Flavio squished the bug.
__label__en	Flavio was standing on the platform.
__label__en	Flavio ran to get help.
__label__en	Flavio ran back.
__label__en	Flavio got back up.
__label__en	Flavio found himself deep inside the sewers.
__label__en	Flavio grabbed a metal piple to defend himself.
__label__en	Flavio saw people walking down the hallway.
__label__en	A giant bug came chasing after Flavio.
__label__en	Flavio saw a giant bug inside the room.
__label__en	The platform fell, making a loud thud.
__label__en	Flavio started bleeding from the mouth.
__label__en	Flavio was surprised to see Rima appear.
__label__en	Flavio will be returning soon with help.
__label__en	Flavio was uninterested.
__label__en	Flavio appeared from around the corner.
__label__en	Flavio helped Rima get up.
__label__en	Flavio dropped a light into the shaft.
__label__en	Flavio closed the lid.
__label__en	The giant bug got stuck at the door.
__label__en	The alien bug dragged Flavio away.
__label__en	Flavio tended to Rima’s wounds.
__label__en	The alien bugs accelerated their breeding cycle.
__label__en	Flavio doesn’t believe that apes turned into humans.
__label__en	The xenomorphs evolved to mimic humans.
__label__en	Flavio repelled the bugs.
__label__en	Flavio left Rima alone.
__label__en	Flavio found an old map in the attic.
__label__en	Flavio ran to the nearest exit.
__label__en	Flavio went to the fuse box.
__label__en	Flavio tried to stay still.
__label__en	Flavio rubbed more of that oil on himself.
__label__en	Male spiders are smaller than females.
__label__en	Flavio wiped out the termite colony.
__label__en	Flavio watched Rima die.
__label__en	Flavio got the fuse box running.
__label__en	The alien bug started moving.
__label__en	Flavio got the train moving forward.
__label__en	She hadn’t forgotten the fun she had playing on the beach in Florida, and while this beach was different—it didn’t have any of the pretty shells or funny little crawdads she had found on the Florida beach—still it had lovely white sand and dainty little waves and was quite the nicest place for play that Mary Jane had seen.
__label__en	The train started smoking.
__label__en	Flavio decided to step out of the train.
__label__en	The alien bugs charged Flavio.
__label__en	Flavio got in.
__label__en	More alien bugs appeared.
__label__en	Flavio crawled through a small tunnel.
__label__en	Flavio found the nest of the xenomorphs.
__label__en	Flavio made it out just in time.
__label__en	Flavio trapped the alien bug in the room.
__label__en	An alien bug was chasing after Flavio.
__label__en	Flavio fell into the water below.
__label__en	Flavio produced the spak that ignited the gas.
__label__en	Flavio gained consciousness and saw Rima.
__label__en	The alien bug approached Flavio.
__label__en	Flavio froze in fear as the alien bug approached him.
__label__en	The alien bug got squished.
__label__en	Flavio got everything under control.
__label__en	Flavio rushed to Rima.
__label__en	Flavio climbed an abandoned building.
__label__en	Flavio and Rima shared an embrace.
__label__en	Flavio betrayed the city.
__label__en	Flavio asked Rima to get some supplies for him.
__label__en	Flavio delivered the items requested by Rima.
__label__en	Flavio’s place is with the leaders of the city.
__label__en	Flavio makes the rules here.
__label__en	“The U.N. has assessed that by 2030 the global demand for water will outstrip supply by 40 percent,” he said.
__label__en	Flavio addressed the crowd, apologizing for his past failures.
__label__en	Flavio is nothing more than a sheep and he should be eliminated if he resists his shepherd.
__label__en	Flavio’s spirit is still alive.
__label__en	Flavio followed the will of the people.
__label__en	Flavio expressed his disgust.
__label__en	Flavio can control the crowd.
__label__en	Flavio confronted Rima.
__label__en	Flavio wanted to leave the city.
__label__en	Flavio will understand one day.
__label__en	Flavio and Rima discussed leaving the city.
__label__en	Flavio can’t leave.
__label__en	Flavio took Rima away.
__label__en	Flavio was stopped by some guards.
__label__en	The guards walked away.
__label__en	Flavio did that for his family.
__label__en	Flavio was questioned by a guard about Walid.
__label__en	The gate was open, too.
__label__en	Flavio has been branded a traitor.
__label__en	Flavio helped Rima pass the gate.
__label__en	Flavio went over the wall.
__label__en	Flavio was shocked by an electric fence.
__label__en	Flavio moved past the fence.
__label__en	Flavio was on the other side of the wall.
__label__en	The soil was radioactive.
__label__en	Flavio continued on.
__label__en	Flavio took shelter in an abandoned building.
__label__en	Flavio heard something behind him.
__label__en	Flavio defended the group.
__label__en	A guard appeared out of thin air.
__label__en	The guard attacked Flavio.
__label__en	Flavio was astounded by the technology.
__label__en	Flavio was decontaminated.
__label__en	Flavio burnt his old clothes.
__label__en	Flavio received an identification mark.
__label__en	Finally, the lights turned off.
__label__en	They tried to alter the human genome.
__label__en	Flavio is a celebrity.
__label__en	Flavio gave Rima a chance.
__label__en	Flavio is the director of the bureau.
__label__en	Flavio wnted to see the director.
__label__en	Flavio watched Rima leave.
__label__en	Flavio expressed his amazement.
__label__en	Most cities are like Algiers.
__label__en	Flavio watched Rima grow from birth.
__label__en	Flavio is a miracle.
__label__en	Flavio intends to restore order in the city.
__label__en	Flavio has a pure human genome.
__label__en	Flavio showed Rima the results of the experiment.
__label__en	Flavio’s mother wasn’t born in Algiers.
__label__en	Flavio asked Rima if she trusted him.
__label__en	Flavio and Rima embraced.
__label__en	Flavio was greeted by Rima.
__label__en	Flavio can’t go upstairs.
__label__en	It’s one of the rules.
__label__en	Being different isn’t a bad thing.
__label__en	Flavio is part of the surveillance team.
__label__en	Flavio caved in and did his job.
__label__en	Flavio is part of the militia.
__label__en	Flavio began training with his drones.
__label__en	Flavio and Rima were having a conversation.
__label__en	Flavio countered with an ambush.
__label__en	Flavio made a report.
__label__en	Flavio overheard Rima telling everything to Walid.
__label__en	Flavio knows he is wanted.
__label__en	Flavio said it didn’t matter.
__label__en	Flavio doesn’t really know what’s going on outside the city.
__label__en	Flavio went out with the guards.
__label__en	Flavio left the bureau.
__label__en	Flavio was taken away.
__label__en	Flavio was searching for people to save.
__label__en	Flavio was found outside the city.
__label__en	Parents who follow lax ideas are doing their child a disservice.
__label__en	There are issues that we need to discuss.
__label__en	Flavio brought the child.
__label__en	Flavio’s memory was erased.
__label__en	Flavio vowed to fight on.
__label__en	Flavio tried to stop Rima.
__label__en	Flavio took Rima hostage.
__label__en	Flavio wants to go back to Algiers.
__label__en	Flavio left to go with Rima.
__label__en	Flavio is making the right choice.
__label__en	He postponed his departure by two days.
__label__en	Flavio isn’t taking Rima to Rima.
__label__en	A fight broke out.
__label__en	My dear Mrs. Juno, Gregory is one of those terribly uxorious men who ought to have ten wives.
__label__en	If you do it, I'll do it too.
__label__en	Flavio gave a report to the council.
__label__en	The council distrusted Flavio.

__label__en	Flavio knows how to save the city.
__label__en	Flavio is one of Rima’s enemies.
__label__en	Flavio changed his mind.
__label__en	The gas was spreading through the city.
__label__en	The gas entered Flavio’s room.
__label__en	Flavio closed the gate.
__label__en	I don't feel like doing my math homework today.
__label__en	Flavio tried to get Rima to stop.
__label__en	Flavio used the drones to locate Walid’s men.

__label__en	The answer to Flavio’s question is a no.

__label__en	How do you see it?
__label__en	Flavio deserved the scare.
__label__en	Flavio wanted to take Rima’s money.
__label__en	Flavio isn’t here to judge Rima.
__label__en	Flavio has a hidden compartment inside his room.
__label__en	Flavio shook the cabinet.
__label__en	Flavio checked the table.
__label__en	Flavio checked Rima’s shoes.
__label__en	Flavio prayed to his deceased father instead of praying to God.
__label__en	Flavio reminded Rima to pray to God.
__label__en	Flavio can’t hear Rima.
__label__en	Just because Flavio isn’t hear doesn’t mean that he can’t hear us.
__label__en	Flavio went to the house of a friend.
__label__en	Flavio arrived at his friend’s place.
__label__en	Flavio took a look at Rima.
__label__en	Flavio decided to play with a Ouija board.

__label__en	The table suddenly moved towards the door.
__label__en	Flavio started talking to a spirit.
__label__en	Flavio woke up from his sleep.
__label__en	Flavio yanked Rima’s blanket away.
__label__en	Flavio stood in the doorway.
__label__en	Flavio confronted Rima about her homework.
__label__en	Flavio hasn’t been helping Rima.
__label__en	Flavio hasn’t learnt to write in cursive.
__label__en	Flavio’s letter is in cursive.
__label__en	Flavio used his hands.
__label__en	This worries Flavio.
__label__en	Flavio told his father about the bad news.
__label__en	Decommissioning is expected to take 40 years and $15 billion, plus the unknown cost of disposing of the plant's radioactive waste.
__label__en	Flavio still doesn’t fully understand the situation due to his young age.
__label__en	Flavio handed Rima a bag full of cash.
__label__en	Flavio asked how Rima knew about that.
__label__en	He put his sweater on backwards.
__label__en	Flavio was skeptical.
__label__en	Flavio joined Rima in using the Ouija board.
__label__en	Flavio answered correctly.
__label__en	Flavio removed his hand from the Ouija board.

__label__en	Flavio is a fraud.
__label__en	Flavio went to bed.
__label__en	Flavio speaks with Rima.
__label__en	Flavio has been absent for four days without a single notice.

__label__en	Flavio went back to watch television.

__label__en	Flavio believes that Rima is talking to spirits.
__label__en	Flavio invited Rima down to the basement.
__label__en	Flavio was initially hesitant.
__label__en	Flavio followed the girl.
__label__en	Flavio found the money.
__label__en	Flavio bought some trinkets.
__label__en	Flavio sat there in horror.

__label__en	J.K. Rowling is just as hateful of trans men as she is of trans women, but this hate manifests as a fake concern.
__label__en	They are not paying me.
__label__en	J.K. Rowling devoted more of her transphobic manifesto to hating trans men than to hating trans women.
__label__en	A lot of Rowling's biggest anti-trans controversies have involved her taking offense to language meant to include trans men and nonbinary people, language which has no effect on her whatsoever.

__label__en	Tom and I chose different things.
__label__en	I was surprised when Tom showed up on time.
__label__en	I didn't think I needed to wait for Tom.
__label__en	I don't need to know who told you that.
__label__en	I hope Tom doesn't have his mind set on doing that.
__label__en	I know the reason Tom doesn't have to do that.
__label__en	Your children are too noisy.
__label__en	Tom isn't from Boston and neither am I.
__label__en	Tom agreed to pay half the rent.
__label__en	Tom has agreed to pay half the rent.
__label__en	Tom and I aren't used to waiting.
__label__en	Tom doesn't drink as much as Mary.
__label__en	Tom doesn't laugh as much as Mary.

__label__en	You finished the paperwork already?
__label__en	They think he just needs a sensible girlfriend to take care of his baser needs.
__label__en	I have this ambivalent attitude towards my boss.
__label__en	You have been lied to about the war in Iraq.
__label__en	Yelha usmel n Tatoeba?
__label__en	How would you like a free pizza?
__label__en	Lorenzo shook his head in disbelief.
__label__en	Lorenzo is incompetent and lazy.
__label__en	Lorenzo was watching the news in his pajamas.
__label__en	The Nazis planned to take over the world, but didn't succeed.
__label__en	Lorenzo was dedicated to the study of language.
__label__en	This dictionary is shit.
__label__en	The dictionary was a fourteen-volume monster.
__label__en	Lorenzo is trying to save money on plane tickets.
__label__en	The project began at a snail's pace.
__label__en	Lorenzo was a language geek.
__label__en	The editors of the encyclopedia had to process forty tons of source material.

__label__en	What's your favorite thing about Algeria?
__label__en	Lorenzo performs internationally.
__label__en	If this is a dream, then I don't want to wake up.
__label__en	Language learning brings a lot of joy in our life.
__label__en	Mind your table manners.
__label__en	East Jerusalem is Palestine, not Israel.
__label__en	East Jerusalem is part of Palestine, not Israel.

__label__en	Lorenzo completed his move with his family.
__label__en	Lorenzo started hiking around in the nearby forest.
__label__en	The forest felt quite peaceful.
__label__en	Lorenzo kept following the river.
__label__en	Lorenzo quickly became concerned.
__label__en	Lorenzo parked in the dirt parking lot.
__label__en	Lorenzo asked to use the telephone.
__label__en	Lorenzo had a very dirty car.
__label__en	Lorenzo's car was rusty.
__label__en	Lorenzo heard some singing inside the church.
__label__en	The church was very old and dilapidated.
__label__en	Lorenzo looked at us with no expression on his face.
__label__en	Everyone stopped singing.
__label__en	Lorenzo looked at us with the most unwelcoming glare.
__label__en	Lorenzo slowly backed out of the door and closed the door.
__label__en	Lorenzo quietly left.
__label__en	Lorenzo was standing there, watching Melissa intently.
__label__en	The shelves were mostly dirty and dusty.
__label__en	Lorenzo was behind the counter, reading some old book.
__label__en	Lorenzo saw a telephone pole.
__label__en	Lorenzo thanked Melissa and left quickly.
__label__en	Lorenzo was staring at Melissa with his arms folded.
__label__en	Lorenzo followed the path to the nearest highway.
__label__en	Lorenzo tried to wave down a few people passing, but no one stopped.
__label__en	Lorenzo needed to be careful in those woods.
__label__en	Lorenzo did something really stupid.
__label__en	Doing stupid things was what Lorenzo did to pass the time.
__label__en	Lorenzo lives in an area with a lot of vacant houses.
__label__en	Lorenzo's house has been abandoned for many years.
__label__en	Lorenzo had the Ouija board in his closet.
__label__en	Lorenzo drove straight towards the mosque.
__label__en	Lorenzo parked his car on the side of the road and walked from there.
__label__en	The church was surrounded with woods in all directions.
__label__en	Lorenzo set up the Ouija board.
__label__en	Lorenzo placed the three candles in a triangle formation.
__label__en	Lorenzo began playing with the Ouija board.
__label__en	The planchette started to move.
__label__en	Lorenzo and his friends played with the Ouija board.
__label__en	The Ouija board started spelling out weird words.
__label__en	Lorenzo jumped in reaction.
__label__en	There was no one there as far as we could see.
__label__en	Lorenzo heard some weird noises here and there.
__label__en	Lorenzo kept asking the Ouija board questions.
__label__en	Another sound broke the silence again.
__label__en	A cockroach landed on the Ouija board and we all started laughing.
__label__en	Lorenzo left the Ouija board and the candles behind.
__label__en	Lorenzo sat in the car for a good half hour, talking on the phone.
__label__en	Lorenzo doesn't really believe in any of that stuff.
__label__en	Lorenzo went back to the abandoned house to get his Ouija board back.
__label__en	Lorenzo decided to just leave right away.
__label__en	The curators tried to protect museum buildings from looting by bricking up entrances, but that didn’t help much.
__label__en	Lorenzo was checking out the area.
__label__en	Lorenzo and Melissa are both Roman Catholic.
__label__en	There wasn't much traffic at all.
__label__en	Lorenzo has a barn for his horses.
__label__en	The house is listed for sale.
__label__en	There was a bunch of cars in the parking lot.
__label__en	Lorenzo parked next to an old minivan.
__label__en	Lorenzo lives in a lower income area.
__label__en	There were five rows of pews.
__label__en	There had to be at least fifty people in there.
__label__en	Everyone appeared to be in their forties and fifties.
__label__en	They started looking at Lorenzo one at a time.
__label__en	Lorenzo nervously looked back at Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo smiled at those people, but no one smiled back.
__label__en	There was no woman in there.
__label__en	They seemed to be staring more at Melissa than Lorenzo.
__label__en	Lorenzo wanted to join the mass.
__label__en	Lorenzo was clearly not a priest.
__label__en	Lorenzo got up and hurried out.
__label__en	Lorenzo noticed Melissa's car in the rear view mirror.
__label__en	Lorenzo saw a van catching up with him in the mirror.
__label__en	Lorenzo drove straight home.
__label__en	Lorenzo was a cub scout.
__label__en	Lorenzo was in one of the adjacent rooms.
__label__en	Lorenzo needs to start from the beginning.
__label__en	Lorenzo was at mass with his mother.
__label__en	Lorenzo sat in the back corner.

__label__en	On its way to Americanization since the Spanish-American War of 1898, in the 1930s, the Philippines was still somewhat a Hispanic country. Manila was the 9th largest Spanish-speaking city in this world in 1930 with 324 552 inhabitants. The switch to English for at least written communication was set in motion. Adding to the linguistic confusion, in 1937, the Philippine government chose Tagalog, out of about 200 native Austronesian languages, as the basis of the national language, because it was already dominant in many parts of the archipelago. By the late 20th century, Taglish, the patois of code-switching between Tagalog and English, became the de facto oral-aural lingua franca in the islands, despite that Tagalog (alias Filipino) and English were separate studied subjects in school. English was the window to the external world, whilst Taglish became the familiar chit-chat on the streets and in the domestic media. Spanish embedded itself as many natural-sounding loanwords within Tagalog, Taglish, and other native languages. Tagalog had not been fully "intellectualized" as a language, as many great international works had not been translated into it. Tagalog used in non-humanities fields of science remained only experimental. Artificial Intelligence and machine translation might give Tagalog a "kangaroo-hopping" boost.

__label__en	Lorenzo got inside the bathroom.
__label__en	The stall was locked.
__label__en	Lorenzo headed to the stall directly next to mine.
__label__en	Lorenzo let out a nervous laugh.
__label__en	Lorenzo said nothing back.
__label__en	Lorenzo's truck was the only vehicle in the lot.
__label__en	Lorenzo went to the back of his cabin where he had a sleeping bag.
__label__en	Lorenzo was getting ready for bed.
__label__en	Lorenzo stormed out of the bathroom.
__label__en	Lorenzo double checked to make sure that the doors were locked.
__label__en	What caused Lorenzo to wake up?
__label__en	Lorenzo had to use the bathroom again.
__label__en	Lorenzo was still half-asleep.
__label__en	The room was completely dark.
__label__en	The motion-sensor lights turned on.
__label__en	As soon as Lorenzo stepped in, the motion-sensor lights turned on.

__label__en	Lorenzo's book was sitting on his lap.
__label__en	The police cars pulled into the lot.

__label__en	Lorenzo watched the truck drive away;
__label__en	Lorenzo was reported missing hours before.
__label__en	Lorenzo is always very conscious and alert.
__label__en	Lorenzo headed to a rest stop.
__label__en	Lorenzo pulled cargo from one end of Algeria to the other.
__label__en	Driving a semi is a lonely job.
__label__en	Lorenzo works long hours on the road.
__label__en	Driving a semi is physically and mentally demanding.
__label__en	Semis keep the economy moving.
__label__en	Lorenzo was driving on a long stretch of highway in southern Ghardaia.
__label__en	Lorenzo pulled over and got some rest.
__label__en	Lorenzo nearly crashed his truck.
__label__en	Lorenzo didn't see Melissa until the last second.
__label__en	Lorenzo stepped out of the truck to ask Melissa what she was doing on the side of the road.
__label__en	Melissa looked very dishevelled.
__label__en	Lorenzo flagged down a truck.
__label__en	Lorenzo saw a truck and flagged it down.
__label__en	Lorenzo left Melissa by herself in the rain.
__label__en	Lorenzo completely ignored everything Melissa said.
__label__en	Lorenzo was typing on his phone.
__label__en	Lorenzo drove Melissa to the next rest stop.
__label__en	Lorenzo was trying to pay Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo had a gun pointed at his head.
__label__en	Lorenzo sternly said: "Drive."
__label__en	Lorenzo started to drive.
__label__en	Melissa put her phone in her purse.
__label__en	Every passing second felt like an hour.
__label__en	Lorenzo drove until Melissa told him to stop.
__label__en	The area seemed to be very desolate.
__label__en	Lorenzo didn't ask any questions and continued to comply.
__label__en	Lorenzo started to feel nauseous.
__label__en	Lorenzo told Melissa to stay put.
__label__en	Lorenzo stayed put as Melissa got out of the truck.
__label__en	Lorenzo was carrying a rifle.
__label__en	Lorenzo was waiting inside.
__label__en	Lorenzo scrambled through his options.
__label__en	Lorenzo grabbed his radio and contacted a fellow trucker.
__label__en	Lorenzo began walking over to Melissa's truck.
__label__en	Lorenzo ordered Melissa out of her car at gun point.
__label__en	Lorenzo made his way to the back of the trailer.
__label__en	Lorenzo unloaded his trailer.
__label__en	The men robbed Lorenzo's entire trailer.
__label__en	Lorenzo emptied his trailer.
__label__en	Nobody knew where Lorenzo was.

__label__en	Lorenzo was calling the cops.
__label__en	Lorenzo was greeted by a swarm of police.
__label__en	Lorenzo reported the truck tot he police.
__label__en	The men who saved Lorenzo went by Walid.
__label__en	Lorenzo gave the cops Melissa's information.

__label__en	Lorenzo was never caught and Melissa thinks he will never be.
__label__en	Lorenzo was driving back home.
__label__en	Lorenzo had a place in Algiers.
__label__en	Lorenzo used the restroom.
__label__en	Lorenzo pulled into the rest stop at five in the morning.
__label__en	The parking lot was emtpy.
__label__en	Lorenzo stopped at a rest stop.
__label__en	Whenever Lorenzo stopps at a rest stop, he goes to the restroom.
__label__en	Lorenzo stood up to stretch his legs.
__label__en	The lights inside the cabin were off.
__label__en	Lorenzo approached the rest stop.
__label__en	Lorenzo got inside the cabin.
__label__en	Lorenzo seemed to be looking at Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo pretended that he didn't notice.
__label__en	Lorenzo wasn't expecting to hear that question.
__label__en	Lorenzo bought Melissa two different perfumes.
__label__en	Lorenzo apologized that he couldn't help Melissa out.
__label__en	Lorenzo disappeared behind the garage.
__label__en	Lorenzo grabbed a leash to walk his German Shepherd in the woods.
__label__en	Lorenzo opened the restroom door.
__label__en	Everything was coated in a layer of filth.
__label__en	Lorenzo is the next to drive.
__label__en	Lorenzo heard the restroom door open.
__label__en	Lorenzo is the guy who spoke to Melissa earlier.
__label__en	Lorenzo revealed a knife.
__label__en	Lorenzo quieted down.
__label__en	Lorenzo had no choice but to follow Melissa's orders.
__label__en	Lorenzo screamed Melissa's name at the top of his lungs.
__label__en	Lorenzo appeared out of the tree line with his German Shepherd.
__label__en	Lorenzo drove off immediately.
__label__en	Lorenzo was able to get the license plate of the semi.
__label__en	Lorenzo continued his drive home.
__label__en	Lorenzo gave the police the license plate of the semi.
__label__en	Lorenzo was involved in human traficking.
__label__en	Lorenzo was only seconds away from being kidnapped.
__label__en	Lorenzo tricked innocent people into trusting him.
__label__en	Lorenzo avoids rest stops whenever he travels.
__label__en	You need to give us some back story.
__label__en	Mellisa, who's now Lorenzo's wife, lived in Bejaia, Algeria.
__label__en	Lorenzo decided to take his girlfriend to see the mountainous nature of Kabylie.
__label__en	Lorenzo took Melissa to the various areas of the Blida Atlas.
__label__en	Lorenzo was in the driver's seat.
__label__en	Lorenzo found beer bottles scattered all around the area.
__label__en	The area overlooks the ocean.
__label__en	Lorenzo was standing in front of the cabin.
__label__en	Lorenzo never helps strangers on the road.
__label__en	Lorenzo wasn't a stranger by any means.
__label__en	Lorenzo got out to speak to Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo was almost in tears.
__label__en	Lorenzo was touring around with his daughter.
__label__en	Lorenzo was waiting for help.
__label__en	Lorenzo pulled in behind Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo drove past Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo offered to take Melissa home.
__label__en	Lorenzo continued to drive past Melissa every ten to fifteen minutes.
__label__en	Lorenzo terrified Melissa and her daughter.
__label__en	Lorenzo stayed with the woman for a little while.
__label__en	Lorenzo passed Melissa on the road.
__label__en	Lorenzo had a fairly dark complexion.
__label__en	Lorenzo was in a good situation.
__label__en	Lorenzo came back again.
__label__en	Lorenzo definitely looked creepy as hell.
__label__en	Lorenzo was definitely not friendly.
__label__en	Lorenzo asked if he could help.
__label__en	Lorenzo waited with the woman and the daughter.
__label__en	Lorenzo was waiting for the assistance vehicle.
__label__en	Lorenzo was giving off mega creepy vibes.
__label__en	Lorenzo mumbled: "Good luck!"
__label__en	Lorenzo got in his car and drove off.
__label__en	The assistance vehicle arrived.
__label__en	Lorenzo asked the assistance vehicle driver if he could see his ID.
__label__en	Lorenzo stayed with Melissa for a long time.
__label__en	Lorenzo didn't mean harm and was just trying to help.
__label__en	Lorenzo was definitely up to no good.
__label__en	Lorenzo was there at the right time.
__label__en	Lorenzo's truck broke down in Bejaia, Algeria.
__label__en	Lorenzo decided to take a detour.
__label__en	Lorenzo sit in that spot.
__label__en	Lorenzo was completely surrounded by huge mountains.
__label__en	Lorenzo headed out to the hot spring.
__label__en	Lorenzo was pretty much alone.
__label__en	Lorenzo took off his shoes and hopped into the water.
__label__en	There were five men inside.
__label__en	Lorenzo looked like a hunter.
__label__en	Lorenzo was just a short distance away.
__label__en	Lorenzo was taking big and long strides.
__label__en	Lorenzo headed down the steep bank.
__label__en	Lorenzo's German Shepherd growled at Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo was covered in hunting gear.
__label__en	Lorenzo had to grab his German Shepherd before he lashed out at Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo was coming directly towards Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo continued approaching Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo was completely trapped.
__label__en	Lorenzo threw his key into the ignition and turned his truck on.
__label__en	Lorenzo couldn't even see Melissa's face.
__label__en	Lorenzo reversed his truck and got out of there.
__label__en	Lorenzo's truck was well hidden from the main road.
__label__en	Lorenzo sat there and waited.
__label__en	Only semis drove by.
__label__en	Lorenzo drove up to the mountains.
__label__en	Lorenzo made it into safety.
__label__en	While in the US, Lorenzo ran into a few sketchy areas.
__label__en	Lorenzo took a few pictures of the scenery.
__label__en	The cabin Lorenzo rented was completely secluded.
__label__en	In that part of Algeria, Lorenzo could see miles ahead.
__label__en	Lorenzo made his way into the woods.
__label__en	Lorenzo climbed up and down several small hills.
__label__en	Lorenzo spotted something unusual.
__label__en	The house definitely looked like it was abandoned.
__label__en	The house sat in the middle of nowhere.
__label__en	Lorenzo sat on a rock to eat and drink some water.
__label__en	Lorenzo was inside the barn.
__label__en	The barn was mostly dark.
__label__en	There was an animal inside the barn.
__label__en	Lorenzo got no response.
__label__en	Lorenzo took a few steps closer.
__label__en	Lorenzo was about to take a picture.
__label__en	The noise was coming from above us.
__label__en	There wasn't even a staircase.
__label__en	Lorenzo was about to scream.
__label__en	Who's up there?
__label__en	Lorenzo had a long grey unkempt beard.
__label__en	Lorenzo assumed the man was homeless.
__label__en	Lorenzo needs to show some decency.
__label__en	Lorenzo asked Melissa if she needed help.
__label__en	Lorenzo started walking out.
__label__en	Lorenzo was obviously dumbfounded.
__label__en	Out of instinct, Lorenzo screamed.
__label__en	Lorenzo ran in the direction of the cabin.
__label__en	Lorenzo was at least a mile away from that barn.
__label__en	Lorenzo was literally inches away from death.
__label__en	Why was Lorenzo there in the first place?
__label__en	Lorenzo was sharpening the pitchfork with something.
__label__en	Why did Lorenzo get up?
__label__en	Why was Lorenzo trying to kill Melissa?
__label__en	Lorenzo tried to hit Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo still believed in Santa Claus.
__label__en	Lorenzo was probably asleep.
__label__en	Lorenzo woke up randomly.
__label__en	Lorenzo walked all the way downstairs.
__label__en	Lorenzo didn't have to turn on any lights to see where he was going.
__label__en	As a kid, Lorenzo did a lot of stupid things.
__label__en	Lorenzo peered his head around the wall.
__label__en	Lorenzo started walking down the stairs, too.
__label__en	Lorenzo was delivering presents.
__label__en	Lorenzo tried to take a peek in the bag.
__label__en	There were some presents under the tree.
__label__en	Lorenzo needed to go back to sleep.
__label__en	Lorenzo asked Melissa which way her room was.
__label__en	Lorenzo was looking up at Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo turned off his night light.
__label__en	Lorenzo was excited he just saw a Santa.
__label__en	Lorenzo walked back to his room.
__label__en	Lorenzo was leaving the house.
__label__en	Lorenzo woke up early to his mom's screams downstairs.
__label__en	There were no presents under the tree.
__label__en	Lorenzo's windows were shattered.
__label__en	Lorenzo saw Santa last night.
__label__en	Lorenzo tried getting as much info out of Melissa as possible.
__label__en	Lorenzo was dressed as Santa Claus.
__label__en	Lorenzo stole the Christmas gifts.
__label__en	Santa isn't real.
__label__en	Lorenzo worked as a night security guard.
__label__en	The story was traced back to Lorenzo.
__label__en	Lorenzo worked graveyard hours.
__label__en	Lorenzo hated graveyard hours.
__label__en	Lorenzo sat by the Christmas tree.
__label__en	Lorenzo stepped back into the hall.
__label__en	No one was supposed to be in the hall besides Lorenzo.
__label__en	Lorenzo tried opening the door, but it was locked.
__label__en	How could anyone be in there?
__label__en	This is a false alarm.
__label__en	Lorenzo was behind the front corner of the store.
__label__en	One moment, there was light. The next, darkness.
__label__en	Lorenzo took his master keyring off his belt and tried to open the door.
__label__en	Lorenzo shut the door and locked it.
__label__en	Lorenzo relocked the door.
__label__en	Lorenzo heard a click and then a bang.
__label__en	Lorenzo ran down the hall.
__label__en	Lorenzo was standing in the small hallway.
__label__en	The exit doors were both locked.
__label__en	Lorenzo was afraid of confronting that intruder.
__label__en	Lorenzo cracked the door open just slightly.
__label__en	You need to leave before I call the cops.
__label__en	Lorenzo opened the door fully.
__label__en	Lorenzo greeted Melissa at the door.
__label__en	Lorenzo was facing the door.
__label__en	Lorenzo was making crying noises.
__label__en	The crying stopped.
__label__en	Lorenzo quickly got on his knees.
__label__en	Lorenzo got back on his feet.
__label__en	Lorenzo left the room to call the cops.
__label__en	Lorenzo didn't know how to deal with the intruder.
__label__en	Lorenzo let the cops in.
__label__en	Lorenzo went to the bathroom again.
__label__en	Lorenzo was still inside the bathroom.
__label__en	The police demanded Lorenzo come out with his hands up.
__label__en	Lorenzo was inside the stall.
__label__en	Lorenzo turned to look at Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo's dead eyes stared into Melissa's soul.
__label__en	Lorenzo found out who the intruder was.
__label__en	Lorenzo was working at that mall.
__label__en	Lorenzo is Melissa's youngest sibling.
__label__en	Lorenzo's elder brother is twenty-four.
__label__en	Lorenzo will be returning home soon.
__label__en	Lorenzo took care of Melissa until their parents came back.
__label__en	Lorenzo was just watching TV and movies.
__label__en	Lorenzo watched TV with no lights on.
__label__en	Lorenzo started to get tired.
__label__en	Lorenzo brought Melissa to her room, changed her and took her out.
__label__en	Lorenzo went back downstairs to watch TV.
__label__en	Lorenzo was watching Avatar.
__label__en	I think Lorenzo was watching Avatar.
__label__en	Lorenzo immediately awoke and started crying.
__label__en	Lorenzo picked Melissa up and started rocking her.
__label__en	Lorenzo was tickling Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo turned off the light and left the room.
__label__en	Lorenzo was standing in his crib.
__label__en	Lorenzo went to check the bathroom and it was clear.
__label__en	Lorenzo was imagining things.
__label__en	Lorenzo went down to the living room to continue watching TV.
__label__en	Lorenzo felt like he was in a horror movie scenario?.
__label__en	Lorenzo ran back up to that room.
__label__en	Lorenzo got Melissa out of there.
__label__en	Lorenzo looked into the dark bathroom.
__label__en	Lorenzo was walking through the room towards Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo let Melissa use his phone to call the cops.
__label__en	The house seemed clear.
__label__en	Lorenzo found out how Melissa got in.
__label__en	Lorenzo found out how the intruder broke in.
__label__en	Lorenzo found a bunch of ripped up boxes around the Christmas tree.
__label__en	Lorenzo has no idea how the intruder broke in.
__label__en	I've had several conversations with him this week.
__label__en	He's old enough to drive.
__label__en	He doesn't have any chest hair.
__label__en	Israel doesn't have a constitution.
__label__en	Why doesn't Israel have a constitution?
__label__en	Does Israel guarantee equal rights to all its citizens regardless of their origin?
__label__en	Israel takes away land from the Palestinians and gives it to Jews coming from such places as California, Florida, and Australia.
__label__en	"Israel doesn't want to have a constitution to avoid dealing with such complicated matters as guaranteeing equal rights between the different ethnic and religious groups that live within its borders and the territories it illegally occupies."

__label__en	Both Decadence and Æstheticism, as intellectual movements, have fallen into the nadir of oblivion, and the dust lies heavy upon them, but they left a little leaven to lighten the heavy inertness of correct and academic literature; and now Symbolism, a greater movement than either, is in the ascendant, giving another turn to the wheel, and to all who think deeply about such matters it seems as though Symbolist literature is to be the literature of the future.

__label__en	There is such a thing as "Filipino English." Most Filipinos cannot pronounce English the way Americans do. So, when they speak English, they speak with a Filipino accent. There are also special local words that creep into it. Such includes food words like "hopia" and "pancit." But most of the time, the archipelagic lingua franca is really Taglish, the patois of code-switching between Tagalog and English. Filipinos reserve speaking pure English when Anglophone foreigners are present.

__label__en	Their conversation was interrupted by some very loud music.
__label__en	He was prepared to help her do the washing-up.
__label__en	He was willing to help her wash up.
__label__en	Don't forget to fasten your seat belt.
__label__en	Don't forget to fasten your seat belts.
__label__en	This bloody computer's not working.
__label__en	I ate chocolate.
__label__en	The sun shines out of his arse.
__label__en	You're bloody right.
__label__en	It's quite a tricky business.
__label__en	Such behaviour appears highly reprehensible.
__label__en	He makes no friends with his loutish behaviour.
__label__en	His boorish behaviour wins him no friends.
__label__en	Time will tell which of the two are right.
__label__en	To get a table at the Crete restaurant, you have to book weeks in advance.
__label__en	The name 'Asia' passed from ancient Greek into Latin, and from there into English.
__label__en	Let's walk a bit slower.
__label__en	Let's walk a bit more slowly.
__label__en	Let's slow down a bit.
__label__en	What he said doesn't count.
__label__en	People tend to forget their own mistakes.
__label__en	People tend to forget their own shortcomings.
__label__en	We tend to forget our own shortcomings.
__label__en	Many people play the lottery dreaming of becoming rich overnight.
__label__en	He's just a spectator.
__label__en	Tom's not bad-looking, and he does have charm, but he hasn't got a shred of ambition.
__label__en	All your base are belong to us.
__label__en	Tom was killed by a donkey.
__label__en	My favorite designer is Tom Jackson.
__label__en	Sometimes, in a bilingual or multilingual family, children speak to parents in Language A, and parents speak to their children in Language B, and they inter-comprehend. Such is the case in my immigrant family from the Philippines, who, in North America, have us children speak English to parents, and parents speak to us children in Tagalog. I am able to speak to other Filipinos in Tagalog. It has just become customary in my family to have the complex linguistic situation.
__label__en	Wasn't he once your friend?
__label__en	You know your post was true if Facebook deleted it.
__label__en	Lorenzo just quit.
__label__en	Lorenzo glanced up high into the sky.
__label__en	Lorenzo was five feet away from Melissa.
__label__en	Only the glass door was separating Lorenzo and Melissa apart.
__label__en	Lorenzo was spending a weekend with his uncle on his ranch.
__label__en	Lorenzo was in the heart of the storm.
__label__en	Lorenzo always enjoyed listening to storms.
__label__en	The movie finally ended.
__label__en	Lorenzo turned off the TV and tried to fall asleep.
__label__en	Lorenzo heard some sort of metallic thud coming from the outside.
__label__en	Zuckerberg knows who ate what when.
__label__en	I could have sworn I heard that sound again.
__label__en	Lorenzo was never close with his uncle even remotely.
__label__en	Lorenzo was getting concerned.
__label__en	Lorenzo finally got out of bed.
__label__en	Lorenzo walked over to the window.
__label__en	A flash of lightning lit up the property.
__label__en	Lorenzo wouldn't be happy about that.
__label__en	Lorenzo opened the window and peered outside.
__label__en	Lorenzo stuck his head out of the window and looked.
__label__en	Lorenzo saw Melissa with her hands raised in the air.
__label__en	Lorenzo was bashing at the basement door lock.
__label__en	Lorenzo might have seen Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo ran to his bed and pretended to be asleep.
__label__en	Lorenzo hoped that Melissa would go away.
__label__en	Lorenzo went to tell his uncle.
__label__en	Lorenzo turned to face the window.
__label__en	Lorenzo was standing at the window, looking in at Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo was yelling like a madman.
__label__en	The basement door was almost bashed open.
__label__en	Lorenzo was out of there.
__label__en	Lorenzo has been OK.
__label__en	Lorenzo doesn't talk to Melissa that much at all.
__label__en	Lorenzo made matters much worse.
__label__en	Who do you think won?
__label__en	Russia is in the way of the world power aspirations of Kissinger, Klaus Schwab, George Soros and the other members of the private club.
__label__en	He is a moocher and never pays for anything.
__label__en	Lorenzo farted in the bath.
__label__en	Lorenzo siphoned gas out of the truck.
__label__en	The tale was corrupted.
__label__en	The Berbers emerged from the haze of history more than 3500 years ago.
__label__en	Lorenzo never bathed.
__label__en	This meal fills me up.
__label__en	Lorenzo had a major appetite for women.
__label__en	Rasputin had a soul-piercing stare.
__label__en	Lorenzo used his magic powers on Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo smelt like the asshole of a warthog.
__label__en	Lorenzo was a lover of epic proportions.
__label__en	The Nazis used live humans as their test subjects.
__label__en	Netanyahu is a despicable human being.
__label__en	As a president, Bush Junior was an asshole and millions of Americans bought into his assholy lies.
__label__en	Lorenzo swapped Algiers for a remote farm in Setif.
__label__en	Netanyahu is a monster draped in the skin of a man.
__label__en	Netanyahu needs to be made to pay for his crimes.
__label__en	By the age of twenty-four, Lorenzo had outgrown his shyness.
__label__en	Lorenzo was detained at Auschwitz.
__label__en	They don't understand shit.
__label__en	Israel evacuated Gaza because it became ungovernable.
__label__en	Lorenzo worked as a laborer on a farm in Algeria.
__label__en	Walking barefoot on soft sand or on grass is a pleasure for me.

__label__en	The restaurant has reopened after a complete makeover.
__label__en	Anyone can come in.
__label__en	I encourage you to experience the thrill of adventure.
__label__en	He shattered my certainties.
__label__en	He settled down for the night.
__label__en	I went about to do my own business.
__label__en	I fall asleep by ten o'clock.
__label__en	My lunch exploded in the microwave.
__label__en	Tom's plan to win Mary back backfired big time. Now she hates him more than ever.
__label__en	I didn't even recognize you at first.
__label__en	Have you come from far away?
__label__en	Indeed, if we are strictly logical on the point of the euphony of language, the Italian dialect, which we deem so soft and liquid, sounds quite harsh, I’m told, in comparison with the labial syllables that the Polynesian islanders use in the South Seas.
__label__en	I don't have any way of checking this fact.
__label__en	Tom is going to pop out to the shops to get some milk.
__label__en	I don't know why I am the way I am.
__label__en	The study based on UCLA research found that obese children—those with a Body Mass Index (BMI) in the 95th percentile or above—are nearly two times more likely to have three or more physical or mental conditions than kids with a healthy weight.
__label__en	Tom's a bit nutty.
__label__en	Why don't you pop over to my place for a cup of tea tomorrow?
__label__en	I started playing in the streets.
__label__en	I set out, trying not to lose sight of the landmarks that he'd pointed out to me.
__label__en	He'd been gone only five days.
__label__en	The first object that caught his attention was a large grimoire, or book of spells, which lay open on the philosopher's desk.
__label__en	It's only been five days.
__label__en	I don't know, things change so much in years.
__label__en	I don't know if things will ever change.
__label__en	I felt I could tell him everything.
__label__en	I found out it's not pomelos that I'm allergic to.
__label__en	He described the party as corrupt and inept and pledged to lower the price of fuel once his opposition coalition takes over control of government.
__label__en	People have spread bad rumours about me.
__label__en	He still drinks beer at eighty years old.
__label__en	I'm not saying this to make myself likeable. I mean it.
__label__en	Logic, in the Middle Ages, and down to the present day in teaching, meant no more than a scholastic collection of technical terms and rules of syllogistic inference.
__label__en	I talk to you, listen to me.
__label__en	In my opinion, smoking is a ridiculous and detestable act, in addition to being very harmful to health.
__label__en	I speak to you, listen to me.
__label__en	I assure you this house with no other occupant but that sniveling woman is a miserable place.
__label__en	I do not consider myself able to translate, reasonably well, any sentence into Toki Pona.
__label__en	To provide food for two out of what had been scrimping for one was a problem; but Miss Bennett ate very little, and she did not resume her tea so they managed to get along and not really suffer.
__label__en	But Gregory exorted them to persevere in their purpose, advised them to choose some interpreters from among the Franks, who still spoke the same language with the Saxons, and recommended them to the good offices of Queen Brunhilda, who had at this time usurped the sovereign power in France.
__label__en	In the second Vase-room of the British Museum the painting on one of these vases represents two persons sitting on a couch, upon which is a cushion of rich material, while for the comfort of the sitters there is a footstool, probably of ivory.
__label__en	Smoking is an unconscious action. It is impossible for someone, conscious of what he is doing, to light and smoke a cigarette, a cigar or a pipe.
__label__en	Nevertheless, timber, with lath and plaster, and thatch for the roofs, constituted the chief materials in the dwellings of the English from an early period till near the close of the fourteenth century and beginning of the fifteenth, when bricks began to be used in the better sort of houses.
__label__en	Does Tom deserve it at all?
__label__en	For a non-smoker, the mouth of a smoker tastes like ash and smoke.
__label__en	Were you a hyperactive kid?
__label__en	God is punishing me, isn't he?
__label__en	Clinginess is an undesirable quality in a romantic partner.
__label__en	That's none of your fucking business!
__label__en	I thought it was all so stupid.
__label__en	Timeouts are out.
__label__en	Time outs are out.
__label__en	Can you believe that they're giving these out for free?
__label__en	He was well on in years.
__label__en	Try to avoid that.
__label__en	My heart was beating rapidly.
__label__en	Her cousin is my wife.
__label__en	She's always mad.
__label__en	She's always angry.
__label__en	There's no bad weather, only bad clothing.
__label__en	He held the door for me.
__label__en	He's forty-two years old.
__label__en	They're too small.
__label__en	Happiness exists not in things, but in the hearts of the people who see and use those things.
__label__en	He opened up a world to me.
__label__en	"Which of the women is your aunt?" "The one on the right."
__label__en	With high-precision performances from both players, the eleventh match of the FIDE World Chess Championship 2023 ended in a draw. Now (April 24): Nepo 6, Ding Liren 5. Three more draws will be enough for the Russian to reach the tally (7.5) which will give him the title of World Champion
__label__en	He's suffering from yesterday's hangover.
__label__en	My son is growing by leaps and bounds.
__label__en	He was rubbing his temples.
__label__en	English is difficult.
__label__en	He put everyone in a bad mood.
__label__en	Slovene isn't difficult.
__label__en	The book is a real page-turner.
__label__en	Arabic isn't difficult.
__label__en	Japanese is difficult.
__label__en	Chinese is difficult.
__label__en	German is difficult.
__label__en	Tom had to redo his homework.
__label__en	I want to be like Tom when I grow up.
__label__en	Nothing worth having in life ever comes easy.
__label__en	My mind is elsewhere.
__label__en	I wonder how it will end.
__label__en	He made a joke to lighten the mood.
__label__en	He'd never behave cruelly.
__label__en	I closed my eyes and pretended to sleep.
__label__en	I don't know what exactly I want from him.
__label__en	I can't get his beautiful face out of my mind.
__label__en	I had a non-smoking colleague and neighbor whose wife smoked. I thought to myself: what sacrifices cannot love make a man submit to!
__label__en	He who pisses against the wind is rinsing his teeth.
__label__en	During the pandemic, there were even more flag-wavers in our society.
__label__en	What was the difference between him and me?
__label__en	You're just a few months pregnant.
__label__en	There's only a few months age difference between him and me.
__label__en	Lorenzo brought Melissa down to her uncle's house to stay for the weekend.
__label__en	Lorenzo wouldn't get away with it.
__label__en	Lorenzo's house has been abandoned for decades.
__label__en	The abandoned house was begging to be explored.
__label__en	Lorenzo told Melissa stories about the deaths that happened in that house.
__label__en	Lorenzo was probably making it up.
__label__en	Kids were embellishing all the rumors.
__label__en	It was Lorenzo's turn to hide.
__label__en	Lorenzo climbed the stairs, looking for a good hiding spot.
__label__en	Lorenzo came to a small room with a closet.
__label__en	Lorenzo stepped inside the closet.
__label__en	Lorenzo crouched down and waited.
__label__en	There was still no sign of the seekers.
__label__en	Lorenzo hid there for fifteen minutes and there was still no sigh of his seekers.
__label__en	What has Lorenzo been doing in the shed?
__label__en	Lorenzo is abandoned here in Algiers.
__label__en	Lorenzo heard a door slamming shut downstairs.
__label__en	Lorenzo is one of Lorenzo's cousins.
__label__en	Lorenzo heard footsteps and a thud.
__label__en	Lorenzo's footsteps were slow and heavy.
__label__en	The footsteps continued to ascend.
__label__en	The walking resumed.
__label__en	After another moment of silence, the footsteps resumed.
__label__en	Lorenzo wandered aimlessly in the garden.
__label__en	The footsteps reached Lorenzo's door.
__label__en	The footsteps continued on to the bathroom.
__label__en	There were no more sounds.
__label__en	Lorenzo heard raspy breathing behind him.
__label__en	Lorenzo navigated through the dark house.
__label__en	Lorenzo never looked back.
__label__en	Lorenzo saw absolutely nothing.
__label__en	Nobody was chasing Lorenzo.
__label__en	Lorenzo ran all the way back to his aunt's house.
__label__en	Lorenzo demanded to know where Melissa had been.
__label__en	Eventually, the police called in.
__label__en	The police scoured every building in town.
__label__en	Lorenzo spent hours searching for Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo was hinding in an abandoned house.
__label__en	Lorenzo was smiling and waving down at Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo slept in the closet.
__label__en	Lorenzo over at his friend's house.
__label__en	Lorenzo was in the same grade as Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo is also fourteen.
__label__en	Lorenzo is only fourteen years old.
__label__en	Lorenzo anbd Melissa were the only kids on the entire block.
__label__en	Lorenzo and Walid were close friends.
__label__en	Lorenzo and his friends played a great game of manhunt.
__label__en	There wasn't a lot going on in our area.
__label__en	Lorenzo hid first.
__label__en	Lorenzo had Melissa on his team.
__label__en	Lorenzo was an old man who passed away a few years ago.
__label__en	Lorenzo went to the back section of the property.
__label__en	Lorenzo wanted to try someting crazy.
__label__en	Lorenzo waited alone in the bushes.
__label__en	Lorenzo was in those bushes for like fifteen minutes.
__label__en	Lorenzo was making a lot of noise, making his presence known.
__label__en	Lorenzo was standing near one of the windows.
__label__en	Lorenzo was relieved to see Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo let Melissa know that it was time to go.
__label__en	Lorenzo felt like his heart stopped when he saw Melissa in the hallway.
__label__en	Lorenzo heard a noise coming from upstairs.
__label__en	Lorenzo has moved into the home.
__label__en	Nobody has lived there for five years.
__label__en	Lorenzo flicked on the light and saw Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo went through the entire house and found nothing.
__label__en	Lorenzo hasn't seen anything strange since.
__label__en	Lorenzo had nothing to do for the night.
__label__en	Lorenzo was going to some huge party upstate.
__label__en	Lorenzo drank and went crazy.
__label__en	Lorenzo had no plans.
__label__en	Lorenzo was a shy kid.
__label__en	Lorenzo helped Melissa to break out of her shell.
__label__en	Lorenzo had to stay in a motel.
__label__en	Lorenzo was honking his horn outside.
__label__en	The sky turned bright orange as the sun was setting.
__label__en	Lorenzo rolled down the window and called Melissa's name.
__label__en	here were beer bottles scattered everywhere.
__label__en	Lorenzo was holding a beer bottle.
__label__en	Lorenzo parked the car in the grass.
__label__en	Parking is free for all.
__label__en	Lorenzo found some other friends on the beach.
__label__en	Lorenzo handed Melissa a beer which he nervously accepted.
__label__en	Lorenzo asked Melissa how old she was.
__label__en	Lorenzo felt alone and awkward.
__label__en	At the party, Lorenzo felt alone and awkward.
__label__en	Lorenzo had a beer in his hand.
__label__en	Lorenzo was like in his forties or fifties.
__label__en	Lorenzo took the beer out of Melissa's hand.
__label__en	Lorenzo choked up for words.
__label__en	Lorenzo put the beer on a nearby table.
__label__en	Lorenzo asked Melissa who she was there with.
__label__en	Lorenzo talked his way away from that guy.
__label__en	Lorenzo felt so alone and awkward.
__label__en	Lorenzo sat on a log, reflecting on himself.
__label__en	Lorenzo heard a huge boom and a roar of cheering.
__label__en	Fireworks were blowing up in the sky.
__label__en	Lorenzo tried to scream and break free.
__label__en	Lorenzo felt like he was becoming light-headed.
__label__en	Lorenzo grabbed a big stone from in front of him and struck that guy in the face.
__label__en	Lorenzo let loose his grip.
__label__en	Lorenzo got up and ran.
__label__en	Lorenzo and Walid were wearing the same thing.
__label__en	Lorenzo was the host of the party.
__label__en	Lorenzo asked Melissa if she knew the man.
__label__en	Lorenzo was too drunk to drive.
__label__en	Lorenzo ended up driving to the motel.
__label__en	Lorenzo didn't tell anyone about the incident out of embarrassment.
__label__en	Lorenzo regrets that now.
__label__en	Lorenzo lives in a calm suburban neighborhood.
__label__en	Lorenzo was covering someone's shift.
__label__en	Lorenzo was having his kind of fun in the basement.
__label__en	Lorenzo was playing his favorite game.
__label__en	Lorenzo was talking with some friends.
__label__en	Lorenzo's broken dishwasher sounded very loud.
__label__en	Lorenzo increased the volume on his headset.
__label__en	Lorenzo has a broken dishwasher.
__label__en	Lorenzo got back to his game.
__label__en	The volume was on 94%.
__label__en	Lorenzo reduced the volume.
__label__en	The sound wasn't from the dryer.
__label__en	Lorenzo came to look what was making that noise.
__label__en	Lorenzo has never gone in there.
__label__en	Lorenzo didn't want to go down there.
__label__en	Lorenzo went to the basement door and listened.
__label__en	The sound went on for a good five minutes before silence.
__label__en	The sound started again.
__label__en	Lorenzo had no weapons to defend himself.
__label__en	The sound was very loud.
__label__en	Lorenzo took his phone and dialed his wife's number.
__label__en	Lorenzo will be over as soon as he can.
__label__en	Somebody was in Lorenzo's apartment.
__label__en	Fireworks were booming in the distance.
__label__en	There is an intruder in Lorenzo's house.
__label__en	Lorenzo heard footsteps coming upstairs.
__label__en	Lorenzo was crawling as far away as he could from the window.
__label__en	Lorenzo couldn't even see Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo looked away from the window and saw Melissa crying.
__label__en	Lorenzo was in cuffs.
__label__en	Lorenzo gave Melissa an evil hateful stare before being taken away to the police car.
__label__en	Lorenzo lives in a very quiet town in Algeria.
__label__en	Lorenzo decided to come over to Melissa's house.
__label__en	Lorenzo doesn't have closeby neighbors.
__label__en	Lorenzo brought some firecrackers.
__label__en	Lorenzo finished his fourth beer.
__label__en	Lorenzo lit up the firecrackers.
__label__en	Lorenzo noticed his garage was open.
__label__en	Lorenzo walked over to the garage.
__label__en	Lorenzo went inside the garage and turned on the light.
__label__en	Lorenzo broke into Melissa's garage and possibly robbed her.
__label__en	Lorenzo doesn't know what the robber took.
__label__en	Lorenzo momentarily left the party to check his apartment.
__label__en	Lorenzo just sat there, outside, on the porch.
__label__en	Lorenzo couldn't wait anymore.
__label__en	The fireworks lit up the whole neighborhood and Lorenzo loved it.
__label__en	The fuse was burning.
__label__en	Lorenzo and Melissa both looked in that direction.
__label__en	Lorenzo saw a figure in the woods facing him.
__label__en	Lorenzo chased Melissa into the woods.
__label__en	Lorenzo turned on the security camera in the garage that he hadn't used for a long time.
__label__en	The garage light was on.
__label__en	Lorenzo's entire garage was completely trashed.
__label__en	Lorenzo checked the surveillance footage.
__label__en	The camera was blocked by something.
__label__en	Lorenzo rushed back to the garage.
__label__en	Lorenzo never found the robber.
__label__en	The first time Lorenzo used a Ouija board he was about five or six.
__label__en	Lorenzo was eating pizza on the living room floor.
__label__en	Lorenzo decided to put on a fire in the old dusty fireplace.
__label__en	Lorenzo decided to play with the old Ouija board he found in the basement.
__label__en	Lorenzo shivered.
__label__en	The planchette began to move slowly and then quickly.
__label__en	The rock narrowly missed Lorenzo's head.
__label__en	Lorenzo tried to rationalize the situation.
__label__en	The fire went out, plunging the room into darkness.
__label__en	Lorenzo trembled with fear.
__label__en	Lorenzo grabbed his car keys.
__label__en	The growling grew louder and more menacing.
__label__en	We piled into the car.
__label__en	Lorenzo felt like something sinister was watching him from the shadows.
__label__en	Lorenzo shared stories of his paranormal experiences.
__label__en	Lorenzo watched a Halloween movie.
__label__en	Lorenzo has always been intrigued by the idea of Ouija boards.
__label__en	Lorenzo pulled the Ouija board out and checked it.
__label__en	We gathered around the table and set up the Ouija board.
__label__en	The atmosphere in the room became heavier and more oppressive.
__label__en	Lorenzo quickly put the Ouija board away.
__label__en	Lorenzo woke up in the middle of a stormy night.
__label__en	Lorenzo glanced around his dark room.
__label__en	Lorenzo heard a voice coming from downstairs.
__label__en	The voice sent chills down Lorenzo's spine.
__label__en	Lorenzo tried to convince himself it was just his imagination.
__label__en	The door downstairs slammed shut.
__label__en	Nobody slept downstairs.
__label__en	Something sinister was at play.
__label__en	That night, Lorenzo didn't sleep another wink.
__label__en	Lorenzo experienced strange occurrences.
__label__en	Lorenzo's face paled.
__label__en	Lorenzo disposed of the Ouija board.
__label__en	Through his Ouija board, Lorenzo engaged with forces he couldn't understand or control.
__label__en	Lorenzo couldn't shake the feeling that he wasn't alone.
__label__en	Lorenzo decided to purchase a Ouija board.
__label__en	The Ouija board was plain and unassuming.
__label__en	Something was haunting Lorenzo's house.
__label__en	Lorenzo's hand was trembling slightly as he set the Ouija board up.
__label__en	The answers Lorenzo received from the Ouija board were erratic and made no sense.
__label__en	Lorenzo angered whatever presence was in his mansion.
__label__en	The faucets spontaneously turned on.
__label__en	The noise caused Lorenzo to cower in fear.
__label__en	Lorenzo became possessed.
__label__en	Lorenzo's eyes rolled back in his head.
__label__en	Lorenzo spoke in a deep guttural voice that was not his own.
__label__en	Lorenzo collapsed to the floor.
__label__en	Lorenzo broke his lease and moved out of the apartment.
__label__en	Lorenzo never touched the Ouija board again.
__label__en	Through the Ouija board, Lorenzo invited unknown forces into his life.
__label__en	Lorenzo told us a lot of Oujia board horror stories.
__label__en	Lorenzo told us spine-chilling stories about haunted houses.
__label__en	Those spirits will pull Lorenzo into the abyss.
__label__en	Lorenzo was sitting in his closet.
__label__en	Lorenzo's encyclopedias are sitting in his closet, collecting dust.
__label__en	Lorenzo dug the Ouija board out of his closet.
__label__en	Lorenzo was jokingly moving the planchette on the Ouija board.
__label__en	Lorenzo was in a dark room, only lit by candles.
__label__en	Lorenzo sat the candles on the table.
__label__en	The planchette began to move.
__label__en	Lorenzo moved his hand away.
__label__en	The planchette kept moving.
__label__en	The planchette landed on the word "yes."
__label__en	Lorenzo was shitting himself.
__label__en	Lorenzo and Melissa both looked at each other.
__label__en	Lorenzo heard Melissa's muffled voice coming from the dining room.
__label__en	Lorenzo set the fireplace immediately.
__label__en	Lorenzo told Melissa to never speak about what happened to anybody.
__label__en	Lorenzo threw the Ouija board in the fireplace.
__label__en	Lorenzo took a short break.
__label__en	Lorenzo had to go to the bathroom.
__label__en	Lorenzo started asking the Ouija board without Melissa.
__label__en	Who is in the other room?
__label__en	Lorenzo memorized Melissa's social security number.
__label__en	Lorenzo was communicating with an entity through the Ouija board.
__label__en	Lorenzo was in the other room.
__label__en	Lorenzo ran out of the house.
__label__en	Lorenzo burnt the Ouija board.
__label__en	Lorenzo went nuts for a few months.
__label__en	Lorenzo joined the Air Force.
__label__en	Lorenzo tried out the Ouija board he found in Melissa's garbage.
__label__en	Lorenzo asked the Ouija board stupid questions.
__label__en	Lorenzo asked the Ouija board when he would die.
__label__en	The planchette moved to the letter L.
__label__en	The planchette spelled out the word "death."
__label__en	Lorenzo's German Shephered was free from the leash.
__label__en	Lorenzo dove as fast as he could out of the way.
__label__en	Lorenzo got up to get something out of the fridge.
__label__en	The fan fell off the ceiling.
__label__en	Lorenzo was inches away from getting decapitated.
__label__en	Lorenzo is never touching a Ouija board again.
__label__en	Lorenzo never told people about that.
__label__en	Lorenzo always wanted to try the Ouija board out.
__label__en	Lorenzo will have the whole apartment for himself.
__label__en	Lorenzo tried out the Ouija board on a rainy night.
__label__en	Lorenzo put the Ouija board away and went to bed.
__label__en	At first, Lorenzo thought nothing of it.
__label__en	Lorenzo was sure someone was in his house.
__label__en	Lorenzo heard creaking sounds.
__label__en	The creaking sounds were getting closer.
__label__en	Lorenzo was waiting for something to happen.
__label__en	Lorenzo tried to hold his breath.
__label__en	Lorenzo's door suddenly slammed shut.
__label__en	Lorenzo was completely under his covers, shaking.
__label__en	Lorenzo knew something was going to happen.
__label__en	Lorenzo sat under his covers for hours.
__label__en	The sun started to rise.
__label__en	Lorenzo spotted a Ouija board on the coffee table.
__label__en	Lorenzo didn't tell anybody about it.
__label__en	Nobody would believe what Lorenzo says.
__label__en	Those strange events were linked to the Ouija board.
__label__en	Trying a Ouija board is a huge mistake.
__label__en	Lorenzo had a vintage Ouija board.
__label__en	Lorenzo never played that video game.
__label__en	Lorenzo told Melissa about a video game that she never played.
__label__en	The plants were sitting on the coffee table.

__label__en	The closet light was on again.
__label__en	Lorenzo once again turned off the light.
__label__en	What happened instead was much worse.

__label__en	Lorenzo had no reason to suspect anything paranormal.
__label__en	Lorenzo was home alone while Melissa was at work.
__label__en	Lorenzo associated that noise with the thunder.
__label__en	There was no way the wind could have knocked that planter down from where it was.
__label__en	Lorenzo went to the sitting room and called out for Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo had to check the yard just for peace of mind.
__label__en	Lorenzo's room is square-shaped with five closets.

__label__en	Lorenzo brushed his teeth before jumping into the hotel bed.
__label__en	It was almost five o'clock.
__label__en	Lorenzo looked down at the crack under the hall.
__label__en	Lorenzo stayed at a vacant hotel.
__label__en	Lorenzo was pranking Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo checked the peephole again.
__label__en	Lorenzo can see through the peephole.
__label__en	Lorenzo kept knocking on the door.
__label__en	We don't have cameras in the hallways.
__label__en	The cop seemed very calm and disconcerned with what Lorenzo told him.

__label__en	Lorenzo flipped from his side to his back.
__label__en	Lorenzo saw a giant humanoid figure in the woods.
__label__en	Lorenzo jumped across his bed to flick on the lamp.
__label__en	Lorenzo gave himself a couple minutes to calm down.

__label__en	The sound was coming from outside Lorenzo's room.
__label__en	The sound was coming from inside the vent.
__label__en	Lorenzo took a peek inside the vent.
__label__en	Lorenzo screamed for his mom.

__label__en	Lorenzo spent the next five years in that same apartment.
__label__en	Lorenzo was having a sleepover with five of his friends.
__label__en	Lorenzo was in Melissa's room, making a lot of noise.

__label__en	Lorenzo was playing with Legos very loudly.
__label__en	Lorenzo muted the TV.
__label__en	Lorenzo let the kids have their fun so long they weren't breaking anything.
__label__en	Lorenzo might have broken something.
__label__en	Lorenzo crept over to the kids' room and listened.
__label__en	Lorenzo opened the door out of curiosity.
__label__en	Lorenzo noticed that the window was completely open.
__label__en	Lorenzo went back to the living room.
__label__en	Lorenzo noticed through the corner of his eye a black shadow in the corner.
__label__en	In a panic, Lorenzo yelled for Melissa to tell him where she was.
__label__en	Lorenzo felt a mixture of feelings in his stomach.
__label__en	Lorenzo ran out of the front door.
__label__en	Lorenzo walked towards the truck.
__label__en	Lorenzo yelled at Melissa to stop.
__label__en	Lorenzo floored his car down the street.
__label__en	They all came to pick up their kids.
__label__en	Lorenzo ultimately thanked Melissa.
__label__en	A random man came to Lorenzo's porch and pounded on his door.
__label__en	This is what disturbs Lorenzo the most.
__label__en	Lorenzo needed to find something to do.
__label__en	Lorenzo needed to find somewhere to smoke.
__label__en	Lorenzo smoked in the woods.
__label__en	Lorenzo smoked behind Melissa's house.
__label__en	Lorenzo had fun in the woods.
__label__en	Lorenzo entered the woods.
__label__en	Lorenzo lives in a very nice neighborhood.
__label__en	Lorenzo was exiting the woods.
__label__en	Lorenzo took off running.
__label__en	Lorenzo hid behind the hill.
__label__en	The truck passed.
__label__en	Lorenzo started walking out of the woods.
__label__en	Lorenzo approached the exit.
__label__en	Lorenzo and Melsisa looked at each other, wondering what to do.
__label__en	That was all what Lorenzo could see from there.
__label__en	Lorenzo ran into the woods.
__label__en	Lorenzo stopped to gather his thoughts and his breath.
__label__en	Lorenzo stayed away from those woods for months.
__label__en	Lorenzo went into the woods.
__label__en	Lorenzo went back into the woods.

__label__en	Lorenzo was worried sick.
__label__en	Lorenzo was waiting for Melissa on the porch, worried sick.
__label__en	Melissa is the type of mom you can't bring yourself to go against.
__label__en	Lorenzo decided to head home.
__label__en	Lorenzo got back to his house.
__label__en	Lorenzo was still in his drunken haze.
__label__en	Lorenzo realized the door was unlocked.
__label__en	Lorenzo shut the front door.
__label__en	Lorenzo didn't see his mom anywhere.
__label__en	Lorenzo commonly did that.
__label__en	Lorenzo heard footsteps upstairs.
__label__en	Lorenzo still treated Melissa like a child.
__label__en	After five rings, Lorenzo picked up in a groggy voice.
__label__en	Lorenzo was wandering upstairs.
__label__en	Lorenzo was sleeping right next to Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo's mouth fell out open.
__label__en	I received money in return.
__label__en	Lorenzo is gonna call the cops.
__label__en	Lorenzo was already waiting at the door, worried sick.
__label__en	Five police cars pulled up in front of Lorenzo's house.
__label__en	Lorenzo decided to investigate.
__label__en	Lorenzo checked the crawlspace.
__label__en	Lorenzo didn't feel safe sleeping there that night.
__label__en	Lorenzo simply forgot to lock the door when he left.
__label__en	Lorenzo stopped Melissa from coming over alone at night.
__label__en	Lorenzo is still hiding in there.
__label__en	I felt a terrible pain in my heart.
__label__en	Lorenzo is going to be a freshman in college this September.
__label__en	Lorenzo often has the apartment to himself.
__label__en	Lorenzo was one of the first to show up.

__label__en	Lorenzo was drunk and not coherent at all.
__label__en	Lorenzo went to his parents' bed.

__label__en	Lorenzo burst out of the bed and opened the door.
__label__en	Lorenzo and Melissa were hugging each other.
__label__en	Lorenzo saw Melissa looking at him in the hallway.
__label__en	Lorenzo was touching Melissa's feet.

__label__en	Lorenzo was seemingly following Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo was trying to not be seen.
__label__en	Lorenzo pretended not to notice Melissa.
__label__en	Lorenzo continued to kayak down the creek.
__label__en	Lorenzo took out his phone to try to call the cops for help.
__label__en	Lorenzo threatened to call the police if that man didn't stop following him.
__label__en	Lorenzo decided to fake-call the cops.
__label__en	Lorenzo started kayaking back the way he came.
__label__en	Lorenzo stepped out of the water.
__label__en	Lorenzo made a disturbing discovery.
__label__en	Lorenzo can't explain that away.

__label__en	Lorenzo heard what sounded like an old woman's voice.
__label__en	Lorenzo asked Melissa if she had heard that.
__label__en	The voice got so close and so clear.
__label__en	Lorenzo jumped to help that woman.
__label__en	Lorenzo was in the middle of the woods at night.

__label__en	Pietro had already lounged at Melissa.
__label__en	Pietro pulled out a knife and started screaming at Melissa.
__label__en	Pietro was in a neighboring room.

__label__en	Pietro's truck was sticking out of the crops on the side of the road.
__label__en	Pietro pulled up and stopped the car.
__label__en	Pietro looked through all the windows of the car for anybody, but the vehicle was empty.
__label__en	What Pietro saw was horrifying.
__label__en	Pietro pushed Melissa all the way back to the truck.
__label__en	Pietro made it back into the truck.
__label__en	Pietro wasn't being followed.
__label__en	Pietro and Melissa seemed to get on easy.
__label__en	Pietro has been a bit different ever since this happened to him.

__label__en	Pietro checked the bedroom and it was empty, too.
__label__en	Pietro came back to the room for some reason.
__label__en	Pietro just went to sleep.
__label__en	Pietro woke up to darkness.
__label__en	Pietro pushed Melissa's hand away.
__label__en	Pietro was in his bed.
__label__en	Pietro let out the most blood-curdling scream you have ever heard.
__label__en	Pietro began throwing punches.
__label__en	Pietro held down the man.

__label__en	Pietro tried pulling Melissa into the crops.
__label__en	Pietro yanked himself out from John's grip.
__label__en	Pietro didn't know what Melissa's Halloween costume was supposed to be.
__label__en	Pietro yelled back: "I'm reporting you!"
__label__en	Pietro went to find an employee.
__label__en	Pietro wasn't sure who was wearing that Halloween costume.
__label__en	Pietro tried finding Melissa, then he gave up.
__label__en	Pietro walked over to the booth.
__label__en	Pietro stepped into the woods.
__label__en	Pietro spotted Melissa again.
__label__en	Pietro was blocking the path.
__label__en	Pietro charged full speed at Melissa.
__label__en	Pietro wanted to get Melissa to just leave him alone.
__label__en	Pietro wasn't chasing Melissa anymore.
__label__en	Pietro sat on a rock to chase his breath.
__label__en	Pietro heard footsteps approaching.
__label__en	Pietro's phone started ringing and he silenced it.
__label__en	Pietro started to run back towards the path.
__label__en	Pietro didn't stop running at Melissa.
__label__en	Pietro pushed Melissa to the floor.
__label__en	Pietro got on top of Melissa.
__label__en	Pietro ran towards the entrance of the park.
__label__en	Pietro asked for a manager.
__label__en	Pietro told Melissa about the guy who was chasing him and attacking him in the park.
__label__en	We all went home after that.
__label__en	We all decided to call it a night after that.
__label__en	Pietro invited Melissa to stay at his house on Halloween night.
__label__en	Pietro's neighborhood is the perfect place to go trick-or-treating.
__label__en	There are no more sweets left.
__label__en	Pietro kindly denied Melissa's chocolate.
__label__en	Pietro pulled away from Melissa.
__label__en	Pietro quickly shut the door.
__label__en	Pietro took Melissa's child.
__label__en	Pietro threw himself at Melissa's car and started hitting it with his fists.
__label__en	Pietro jumped in front of Melissa's truck.
__label__en	Pietro pulled Melissa away.
__label__en	Pietro stayed up late like any teenager does on a Friday evening.
__label__en	No one came in.
__label__en	The lights suddenly turned on.
__label__en	Pietro saw a woman standing there.
__label__en	When Pietro stared at Melissa, she ran away.
__label__en	Pietro was quite shaken up by that.
__label__en	The whole school is here seen in epitome: the “stoker” typifies the student toiling at the forge, and in the polished engine, exhibiting both grace and power in its automatic action, we see the student’s graduating project, a machine, the joint creation of brain, eye, and hand.
__label__en	Pietro sat around for an hour, nervous and on high alert.
__label__en	Pietro saw Melissa standing over his bed in the middle of the night.
__label__en	Pietro was inside the house that night.
__label__en	Pietro was home alone on Halloween night.
__label__en	Pietro was away at college.
__label__en	Pietro was left to provide for the trick-and-treaters.
__label__en	Pietro takes Halloween seriously.
__label__en	Pietro dropped his bag on the couch.
__label__en	Pietro was getting homework done.
__label__en	The doorbell rang once more.
__label__en	Pietro went to open the door.
__label__en	Pietro opened the door, expecting some kids. Instead, there was that homeless guy standing on his porch.
__label__en	Pietro slammed the door shut in Melissa's face and locked it.
__label__en	If Pietro does it again, I'll teach him a lesson.
__label__en	Pietro went upstairs to finish his homework.
__label__en	Pietro yelled out what was going on.
__label__en	Pietro asked Melissa to help him find his son.
__label__en	Pietro texted his family again.
__label__en	The basement had no windows.
__label__en	Pietro tampered with the electric box.
__label__en	Pietro heard the floor boards creaking above his head.
__label__en	Pietro texted Melissa to call the cops.
__label__en	All Pietro had to do was wait.
__label__en	Light poured into the basement.
__label__en	Pietro just stood there for like five minutes.
__label__en	Pietro's light was facing Melissa.
__label__en	Pietro didn't move, nor Melissa.
__label__en	Pietro walked up the stairs and shut the door.
__label__en	Pietro ran upstairs to the front door.
__label__en	Pietro left the back door unlocked.
__label__en	Pietro messed with the electric box outside.
__label__en	Pietro didn't belong out on the streets.
__label__en	I don't know what year it was.
__label__en	Pietro decided to do something scary that night.
__label__en	Pietro was on the top of a hill.
__label__en	Pietro was on an enclosed property that had been abandoned for years.
__label__en	Pietro parked his car outside of the property.
__label__en	Pietro was standing in the dark.
__label__en	Pietro even brought a crowbar.
__label__en	The door was already cracked open.
__label__en	Inside the room, it was as dark as it gets.
__label__en	Pietro heard a thump from upstairs.
__label__en	Pietro led the way up the stairs.
__label__en	Pietro passed the first room.
__label__en	There was a second door on the left.
__label__en	Pietro stepped fully inside the room.
__label__en	The door to the room slammed shut.
__label__en	Pietro opened the door to flee the room.
__label__en	Pietro drove Melissa back to campus.
__label__en	Pietro sent Melissa a picture through text.
__label__en	Pietro left the paper under his windshield wiper.
__label__en	Pietro never went near that mansion again.
__label__en	His tight blue frock-coat and his grey trousers were models for the most fastidious dandies; his kindness and gentleness to everyone except professional politicians was extreme; he quoted Horace freely and had a complete knowledge of political history with a prodigious memory.
__label__en	Pietro came in the month of April.
__label__en	Halloween season is pretty hectic.
__label__en	Pietro's shift starts usually at five.
__label__en	There was hardly anyone left in the store.
__label__en	Pietro started work at five.
__label__en	Pietro can try on the costume.
__label__en	Pietro was still working.
__label__en	Pietro was cleaning aisles and stocking shelves.
__label__en	Pietro took a five minute breather.
__label__en	The light to the basement has been turned off.
__label__en	They say a good half of the men who have been in orbit have chucked up or gotten dizzy or something.
__label__en	The United States and Uzbekistan have completed a series of senior-level meetings in Washington with a pledge to build a "qualitatively new" long-term relationship.
__label__en	Cookie wouldn't let Tom have the ball.
__label__en	Two countries with the world’s oldest populations, Japan and Germany, are training geriatric nurses in Vietnam to help fill critical health care gaps at home.
__label__en	Soeder told Ethiopian media the agreement would bring Bavarian expertise in football to the sports-hungry nation of Ethiopia.
__label__en	The team reported that the genetically engineered basmati rice was able to survive in salty soil, at low temperatures and during dry periods.
__label__en	She covered her eyes with her hands.
__label__en	I am currently holding down a professorship at a small, privately endowed Tech college, have some mentionable background in both nuclear physics and biochemistry, possess a choice collection of rather good jazz records, have a particular fondness for barbecued spareribs—and, of late, have become an inventor.
__label__en	He opened his duffel bag, took out a stereo and placed it on the lawn.
__label__en	I'll work less, I promise.
__label__en	My life began to radically change.
__label__en	It's five past twelve.
__label__en	Pietro's basement was really big.
__label__en	Pietro put down the box he was holding.
__label__en	Pietro didn't speak though.
__label__en	Pietro was still messing with Melissa.
__label__en	That man was way too tall to be Pietro.
__label__en	Pietro was wearing dirty boots.
__label__en	Pietro knew for a fact that Melissa wasn't wearing boots.
__label__en	Pietro shut the basement door.
__label__en	Pietro was talking to Melissa about the register.
__label__en	There isn't anyone else working tonight.
__label__en	Pietro wanted to prove that to Melissa.
__label__en	Whoever was down there was gone.
__label__en	Pietro unloaded truck shipments.
__label__en	Pietro didn't see anyone in that costume.
__label__en	Pietro went straight to the costume room.
__label__en	Pietro knew it was a prank.
__label__en	Pietro was in a Halloween costume.
__label__en	Pietro got stuck in the costume room.
__label__en	Pietro heard a plastic bag being slightly crumpled.
__label__en	Pietro dropped the box in the costume room.
__label__en	Pietro looked down the staircase.
__label__en	Pietro didn't wear a mask.
__label__en	Pietro saw Melissa's smiling face looking up at him.
__label__en	Pietro came as fast as he could to the costume room.
__label__en	Pietro was gone for real.
__label__en	Pietro didn't manage to steal anything.
__label__en	Because of the unique technology we've developed, we are able to sell our new product for a lower price than that of our competitors.
__label__en	Pietro was looking to hurt someone.
__label__en	Pietro treated the situation as though his life were in danger.
__label__en	Pietro and Melissa had a wrestling match.
__label__en	The leaves fell off the trees.
__label__en	Pietro was raking up the leaves on his property.
__label__en	Pietro raked up the leaves into a giant pile.
__label__en	Pietro lives on a short dead-end street.
__label__en	Pietro didn't care about anything.
__label__en	Pietro lived in a small dishevelled house.
__label__en	Pietro never seemed to come outside.
__label__en	Pietro went inside after getting tired.
__label__en	Pietro went back outside.
__label__en	Technological development enabled scientific development.
__label__en	Memories that had been tucked away in the deepest recesses of my mind suddenly recured to me.
__label__en	It was time to call a halt on this bandying of words about Mary Everton and her motives.
__label__en	His mother's smiling face flashed across his mind.
__label__en	The elephants crossed the river together.
__label__en	I goofed off a bit much and work started piling up. I'm worried I might not make the deadline.
__label__en	Pietro got back out there.
__label__en	Pietro started to build a pile of leaves.
__label__en	Pietro started raking the leaves over into a giant pile.
__label__en	Pietro hid under the leaves.
__label__en	Pietro was hiding underneath the pile of leaves.
__label__en	Pietro didn't know whether to laugh or not.
__label__en	Pietro didn't expose his face.
__label__en	Pietro walked over to Melissa to expose her face.
__label__en	Pietro was hiding in the bushes.
__label__en	Pietro got us so good.
__label__en	Pietro had crooked teeth.
__label__en	Pietro was breathing very heavily.
__label__en	Pietro and Melissa were playing with the leaves.
__label__en	Pietro left Melissa there.
__label__en	Pietro went outside to check.
__label__en	Pietro eventually left.
__label__en	Pietro went upstairs to play video games.
__label__en	Pietro jumped and looked at the window.
__label__en	Elephants are extremely intelligent.
__label__en	Pietro didn't mean to creep Melissa out.
__label__en	I don't know if this is an update or a bug.
__label__en	Pietro heard Melissa's voice outside the window.
__label__en	Pietro came into view.
__label__en	Pietro pushed the window up further.
__label__en	Pietro tried to climb into the window.
__label__en	Pietro ran upstairs to Melissa's room.
__label__en	Pietro lived in the dead-end.
__label__en	Pietro called the cops and they came.
__label__en	Pietro looked into the house from the doorway.
__label__en	Pietro was a methhead.
__label__en	Pietro was a creepy methhead.
__label__en	Pietro was living in a dishevelled house.
__label__en	Asian and African elephants are as far removed from each other as humans and chimpanzees.
__label__en	Pietro met Melissa at a party.
__label__en	Pietro went apple-picking.
__label__en	Pietro lives in a more rural part of the area.
__label__en	Pietro was about forty minutes away.
__label__en	Pietro passed an apple orchard.
__label__en	Pietro paid to enter.
__label__en	The orchard wasn't open to the public.
__label__en	Pietro walked around the property.
__label__en	I want to be friends with an elephant.
__label__en	Pietro continued the route to the originally planned destination.
__label__en	Pietro's orchard looked almost abandoned.
__label__en	Pietro drove us back to the orchard.
__label__en	Pietro walked down the dirt path.
__label__en	Pietro hopped the little fence.
__label__en	Pietro's orchard had thick apple trees.
__label__en	Pietro brought a plastic bag from his car.
__label__en	Pietro wasn't supposed to pick apples on Melissa's property.
__label__en	Pietro tossed an apple at Melissa.
__label__en	Pietro went down that road.
__label__en	Pietro got to the other side.
__label__en	Pietro had long brown hair to his shoulder.
__label__en	Pietro had a slight smirk on his face.
__label__en	Pietro squeezed on through to the next row.
__label__en	Pietro looked like he wanted to hurt Melissa.
__label__en	Pietro was already waiting by the truck.
__label__en	Pietro was half-hidden by an apple tree.
__label__en	Pietro saw half Melissa's face.
__label__en	Pietro passed a decrepit barn-like house.
__label__en	Pietro lost his apple bag.
__label__en	Pietro picked up some apples and berries.
__label__en	Pietro should never go anywhere near that orchard.
__label__en	Should we buy some spare shoes as well?
__label__en	Pietro hardly ever returned there.
__label__en	Pietro asked Melissa to describe that man.
__label__en	Pietro went apple-picking on Melissa's property.
__label__en	Pietro scolded Melissa for not calling the cops.
__label__en	Pietro was going to warn the cops.
__label__en	Pietro ran face-to-face with a murderer.
__label__en	Pietro was in Melissa's apple orchard.
__label__en	Elephants use tools.
__label__en	Pietro shot the monster with an experimental weapon that evaporated its skin.
__label__en	Pietro attacked Walid furiously.
__label__en	Pietro ran towards the monster.
__label__en	Pietro burnt the monster’s body and turned it into dust.
__label__en	Pietro told the audiences that the game was over.
__label__en	Pietro explained that all that was part of his plan.
__label__en	Go and watch those videos.
__label__en	Pietro became tired of the same outcome.
__label__en	Pietro controls the game.
__label__en	Pietro was able to go home to his family.
__label__en	Pietro left four billion dinars for his wife.
__label__en	Why is Erdogan losing?
__label__en	Pietro stopped the show.
__label__en	Pietro communicated with the doctor.
__label__en	Pietro asked Rima why she didn’t communicate with anyone else.
__label__en	Pietro stopped himself.
__label__en	Pietro and Rima left together.
__label__en	Pietro underwent more procedures.
__label__en	Pietro wants Rima to understand everything.
__label__en	Pietro doesn’t care.
__label__en	After the 13th game, Nepo and Ding are up to 6½ points and the contest is still incredibly exciting. There is still one game left: whoever wins will be the world chess champion; but if it ends in a tie, a tiebreaker will be played.
__label__en	Pietro is a renowned scientist.
__label__en	An earthquake hit Turkey and Syria.
__label__en	The earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria was devastating.
__label__en	Pietro was sent to a research station on the Moon.
__label__en	Pietro suffocated.
__label__en	Pietro’s first experiment was a success.
__label__en	The world was hit with a critical worldwide water shortage.
__label__en	Vertical farms could reduce water usage.
__label__en	The agency is led by Pietro.
__label__en	The agency holds many government secrets.
__label__en	The crew consists of fourteen members, all led by Pietro.
__label__en	Pietro’s death was caused by a radiation leak.
__label__en	Pietro turned down the mission.
__label__en	Pietro lost his life in an accident.
__label__en	Pietro has access to safe and clean water.
__label__en	Pietro was at a station on the Moon.
__label__en	Are Turks tired of Erdogan?
__label__en	The samples must be kept at a regulated temperature.
__label__en	Pietro wasn’t happy with the last minute change.
__label__en	The spacecraft safely entered the Earth.
__label__en	Pietro’s spacecraft fell off the cliff.
__label__en	Pietro has sustained serious injuries.
__label__en	Pietro seemed to know something that the others didn’t.
__label__en	Pietro ended up passing away.
__label__en	Pietro almost ran out of oxygen.
__label__en	Pietro filled up the oxygen tank.
__label__en	Pietro wanted to find out the truth about his sister’s death.
__label__en	Pietro cracked the code.
__label__en	Pietro was confused.
__label__en	Pietro drowned and died.
__label__en	Pietro identified the dead body.
__label__en	Pietro was a mercenary.
__label__en	Pietro is keeping us in the dark.
__label__en	Pietro ordered everyone to stick to the plan.
__label__en	Pietro brought the massive space station back to life.
__label__en	Pietro took off his life support.
__label__en	Pietro ordered a full inspection of the station.
__label__en	Tebboune took the presidential oath, becoming Algeria's new president.
__label__en	Pietro tried to retrieve the samples.
__label__en	Pietro searched the space station for samples.
__label__en	Pietro was sent to the warehouse.
__label__en	Pietro located the samples.
__label__en	Pietro checked the thermoregulator.
__label__en	Pietro has a special purpose.
__label__en	Pietro came across a number of corpses.
__label__en	The area was shut down right after the accident.
__label__en	Pietro accessed Rima’s medical records.
__label__en	Bouteflika wanted to die in office.
__label__en	Pietro reached his destination.
__label__en	Pietro went to the storage unit.
__label__en	Pietro detected a foreign presence moving around the station.
__label__en	Pietro is the head of security.
__label__en	Pietro knows about Rima’s sister.
__label__en	Pietro wanted to get to the bottom of the truth.
__label__en	Pietro decided to utilize the opportunity.
__label__en	Pietro touched the corpse.
__label__en	The droplets entered Pietro’s eyes.
__label__en	Pietro dropped his flashlight.
__label__en	Pietro fetched his flashlight.
__label__en	Pietro brushed that aside as a hallucination.
__label__en	Pietro monitored Rima’s movements from his computer.
__label__en	Pietro managed to retrieve the samples.
__label__en	Pietro was attacked by some unknown entity.
__label__en	The Yautja hit Pietro multiple times before dropping him to his death.
__label__en	Pietro ordered everyone to return to the command center.
__label__en	Pietro was at the command center.
__label__en	Pietro started shaking violently.
__label__en	Pietro put on his hazmat suit.
__label__en	Pietro learnt about the situation.
__label__en	Pietro tried his best to save Rima.
__label__en	Pietro must quarantine Rima’s body.
__label__en	Pietro performed an autopsy on Rima’s body.
__label__en	Pietro gave Rima permission to go through Walid’s medical records.
__label__en	Pietro decided to search the ventilation shaft.
__label__en	Pietro was severely demoralized by the recent events.
__label__en	Pietro tried to establish communication with mission control.
__label__en	Pietro lost his life in an accident four years ago.
__label__en	Pietro entered the ventilation system.
__label__en	Pietro entered the ventilation shaft.
__label__en	Pietro came face to face with the alien.
__label__en	Pietro got infected.
__label__en	Pietro came in contact with Rima and got infected.
__label__en	Pietro rejoined Rima to collect more samples.
__label__en	Pietro returned to the infirmary.
__label__en	Pietro drowned to death.
__label__en	Pietro was left with no choice.
__label__en	Pietro returned to the command center, too.
__label__en	Pietro needs to go outside.
__label__en	Pietro edited the protocol.
__label__en	Pietro volunteered to do the job.
__label__en	Pietro showed Rima a blood sample.
__label__en	Pietro got really close to the alien.
__label__en	Pietro always managed to escape.
__label__en	Pietro was familiar with the internal structure of the facility.
__label__en	Pietro was a survivor.
__label__en	Pietro stole the sample.
__label__en	Pietro repaired the fridge.
__label__en	Pietro tried to stop Rima’s condition from worsening.
__label__en	Pietro fixed the communication system.
__label__en	The elevator became operational.
__label__en	Pietro dropped another rope.
__label__en	Pietro dropped the rope.
__label__en	Pietro damaged his life support system.
__label__en	Pietro was at the infirmary.
__label__en	The virus multiplies rapidly.
__label__en	Pietro found himself inside the station.
__label__en	Pietro lost consciousness due to lack of oxygen.
__label__en	The system didn’t show any malfunction.
__label__en	Pietro immediately rushed there.
__label__en	Pietro maintained permanent contact with mission control.
__label__en	Pietro also wants the samples.
__label__en	Pietro established contact with Earth.
__label__en	Pietro is the spy.
__label__en	Pietro was the copilot.
__label__en	Pietro hasn’t been honest with Rima.
__label__en	Pietro has no reason to hide anything from Rima.
__label__en	Pietro prepared to look for Rima.
__label__en	Pietro was sent to retrieve the samples.
__label__en	Pietro was briefed about the mission.
__label__en	Pietro wanted to save mankind.
__label__en	Pietro came in contact with an alien living organism.
__label__en	Pietro let Rima access the data storage of the station.
__label__en	Pietro removed the lid.
__label__en	Pietro discovered a secret basement in Rima’s mansion.
__label__en	Pietro took photos of his surroundings.
__label__en	Pietro walked into a dark room.
__label__en	Pietro’s body convulsed.
__label__en	Pietro gave Rima an ultimatum.
__label__en	Pietro cut off Rima’s research funds.
__label__en	Pietro was pleased with Rima’s answers.
__label__en	Pietro donned his uniform.
__label__en	Pietro and Rima were touring around the property.
__label__en	Pietro asked about Rima.
__label__en	Pietro’s laboratory is stricly off limits.
__label__en	Pietro sat on the bed.
__label__en	Pietro died in a diving accident.
__label__en	Pietro took Rima away to Walid.
__label__en	Pietro wondered how that was possible.
__label__en	Pietro leant to say hello.
__label__en	Pietro followed Rima’s advice.
__label__en	Pietro found a strange man in the hallway.
__label__en	Pietro revived from a coma.
__label__en	Pietro comes at exactly four o’clock every afternoon.
__label__en	Pietro deleted Rima’s number.
__label__en	Pietro invited Rima for drinks.
__label__en	Pietro called a man who just arrived.
__label__en	Pietro explained that he was a psychiatrist.
__label__en	Pietro said Rima and Walid had a history.
__label__en	Pietro said the patient wasn’t dead.
__label__en	Pietro entered room 4.
__label__en	The procedure was quickly done.
__label__en	Homeless neighbors are neighbors.
__label__en	Tom tentatively agreed to my proposal.
__label__en	We have to get it back.
__label__en	Nepo has the potential to be a world champion, even against Magnus Carlsen, but he seems to keep reaching his psychological limits, making serious mistakes that shouldn't happen at this level.
__label__en	Tom is lying. I didn't do what he said I did.
__label__en	Tom hasn't returned home.
__label__en	I need to buy a flower vase.
__label__en	Denmark is in Scandinavia.
__label__en	I've never seen ball lightning.
__label__en	I have a new drill.
__label__en	Tom can't hold down a job.
__label__en	I drink to numb the pain.
__label__en	I keep them in the safe.
__label__en	I keep it in the safe.
__label__en	Tell them I changed my mind.
__label__en	He usually sits over there.
__label__en	I love your freckles.
__label__en	Come, I'm waiting for you!
__label__en	All women like being told they're beautiful.
__label__en	We had them!
__label__en	We're not Rockefellers!
__label__en	He no longer works as a teacher.
__label__en	Deportation and genocide are different things.
__label__en	I thought your friend was a cop.
__label__en	Neither money nor glory made him happy.
__label__en	Are there any adults home?
__label__en	The streets were covered in ice.
__label__en	That word is spelled with an O.
__label__en	I'll lend you mine.
__label__en	In the 12th game of the World Championship Nepo was already on a win and would have needed only a draw for the title, but in a dramatic back-and-forth, in which both players made serious mistakes, he gave the game away and lost - incredibly bitter for him. Ding, on the other hand, managed to equalize at 6½ : 6½.
__label__en	Stay there with your face to the wall.
__label__en	Come on, don't cry.
__label__en	We'd better get you home.
__label__en	He's extremely curious on this topic.
__label__en	You'll end up doing a dead end job.
__label__en	You'll end up waking up your father.
__label__en	It's your father who is providing you with all these luxuries that you're so used to.
__label__en	Don't worry. It'll be okay.
__label__en	I don't even know who you are.
__label__en	I don't know how to shake him off.
__label__en	What do you think he's doing now?
__label__en	I offered to go and buy food for everyone.
__label__en	He shook out his hair.
__label__en	Let's study the situation.
__label__en	They were all anxiously waiting for the passing of this Bill.
__label__en	He has things to do.
__label__en	He was watching him through binoculars.
__label__en	Your shirt is all wet.
__label__en	He didn't give it any weight.
__label__en	I said things I didn't really mean.
__label__en	The thought of another man touching her brought out the beast in him.
__label__en	He was arm in arm with another man.
__label__en	Two irreconcilable parts of the left are the one that wants Russia, too, to be able to invade countries based on the Monroe Doctrine and the one that doesn't want any country to.
__label__en	She threw on a coat and went outside.
__label__en	South Koreans live in South Korea.
__label__en	North Koreans live in North Korea.
__label__en	Koreans live in Korea.
__label__en	The Japanese live in Japan.
__label__en	Americans live in the United States.
__label__en	Americans live in the U.S.
__label__en	Swedes live in Sweden.
__label__en	Brazilians live in Brazil.
__label__en	Belgians live in Belgium.
__label__en	The French live in France.
__label__en	French people live in France.
__label__en	Russians live in Russia.
__label__en	I won't give you the book back today.
__label__en	His dad kicked him out from home.
__label__en	"Who are those socks?" "They belongs to my sister"
__label__en	He let his goats graze in the forest.
__label__en	She lets her goats graze in our field.
__label__en	Hi Zahra, i hope you are well.
__label__en	She threw on a coat and set off.
__label__en	Since my daughter was born, I haven't had a moment to spare.
__label__en	Who still uses a calculator these days? Your telephone can do all that.
__label__en	Our old postman always used to ring twice, but the new one doesn't ring at all sometimes, instead leaving the parcel with the neighbours so that he can finish work faster.
__label__en	"Oh, biscuits! Pass 'em over." "No, they're for the guests!"
__label__en	That's bollocks. Let's just say it how it is.
__label__en	I slept for a long time.
__label__en	I'll be studying that tomorrow.
__label__en	I'll study that tomorrow.
__label__en	Summer is a long way off.
__label__en	Summer is a long time away.
__label__en	What is the solution?
__label__en	She didn't graze her goats today.
__label__en	"Oh. Hello, Rob." "Your new album's a pile o' shite, so it is!" "It's good to see you, too, mate. Do want to come in for a cup of tea?"
__label__en	Stories like that are legion.
__label__en	Who's going to see you off at the railway station?
__label__en	Are you coming to see me off at the station?
__label__en	I told you to shut up!
__label__en	Their hearts are golden.
__label__en	I kneaded this dough.
__label__en	I forgot them at work.
__label__en	The exit is over there.
__label__en	They have false feelings.
__label__en	It's been a long time since i watched TV.
__label__en	Tell him to hurry up, it's getting late.
__label__en	Children love sweets.
__label__en	There are not many ways.
__label__en	That's all there is, eat and shut up.
__label__en	There are many left.
__label__en	Three years, I think, is a long time.
__label__en	He flipped his right leg up over his motorbike.
__label__en	He started his motorbike.
__label__en	The bus driver was over fifty.
__label__en	He dressed like a teenager.
__label__en	She saw him come out of the bar.
__label__en	He completed his task.
__label__en	He took a narrow path that led winding down to the sea.
__label__en	He took note of the number plate.
__label__en	He placed the gun on the dashboard.
__label__en	He inhaled the cocaine with the help of a straw.
__label__en	She put money in his hand.
__label__en	He hid between two parked cars.
__label__en	They retraced the same path.
__label__en	They went and sat down at a table.
__label__en	She handed him the cigarette packet.
__label__en	He noticed her redone make-up.
__label__en	The car stopped to let her get in.
__label__en	There was contempt in his voice.
__label__en	Do you really think he could have had something to do with the murder?
__label__en	The deceased was eighteen years of age.
__label__en	The player who goes first has an advantage.
__label__en	Pull the knot tighter.
__label__en	Tighten up the knot.
__label__en	He died at the age of ninety years.
__label__en	Human beings are supposed to have two legs.
__label__en	Male human beings have penises and female human beings have vaginas.
__label__en	Male human beings are born with penises, whereas female human beings are born with vaginas.
__label__en	If a man can't get pregnant, no doctor on earth can help him.
__label__en	If a female can't get another female pregnant, no doctor on earth can help her.
__label__en	A human with a penis will always be scientifically a man even if 8 billion people agree to call him a woman just not to anger him.
__label__en	A woman with a vagina will always be scientifically a woman even if 8 billion people agree to call her a woman just not to anger her.
__label__en	Enjoy your stay in Algiers.
__label__en	I would strongly recommend you to read the Quran.
__label__en	This campus was named after Mouloud Mammeri's legacy.
__label__en	The site is completely open to additions and corrections, twenty-four hours a day, but that means it's wide open to ideologues and vandals who deliberately post false information, unfounded accusations, and smut.
__label__en	We will not back down to the mob in any sort of way.
__label__en	Pietro wants bad things for Melissa.
__label__en	The reality is that men are not women and women are not men.
__label__en	They're inflicting violence on women.
__label__en	Pietro defends child pornography.
__label__en	In his book, Pietro defended pedophilia.
__label__en	Are Western Europeans inherently racist?
__label__en	Pietro cares deeply about those young people.
__label__en	Zionists are using Jewish settlers as political kamikazes.
__label__en	Zionist extremists are so evil.
__label__en	The Jewish settlers are just a pawn in the service of the Zionist political agenda.
__label__en	You're a boy if you're born a boy.
__label__en	God made you a boy.
__label__en	The goals of radical Zionists are atrocious.
__label__en	Radical Zionists like fear-mongering.
__label__en	"Which North African country are you from?" "Western Sahara."
__label__en	That feeling is caused by the capsaicin molecules in the peppers activating the capsaicin receptors on our tongue—the more capsaicin, the hotter the pepper.
__label__en	Pietro speaks reality to transgender people.
__label__en	We founded Algeria as a country on November 1, 1954.
__label__en	The Algerian republic was founded on November 1, 1954.
__label__en	You're afraid of going alone.
__label__en	If we abandon the November 1 Declaration, we will get chaos.
__label__en	You're afraid to go alone.
__label__en	They are trying to redefine words such as "woman" and "mother" to suit their own political goals.
__label__en	He passed me on the left.
__label__en	Pietro objects to homosexuality religiously.
__label__en	I feel very safe here as a Muslim.
__label__en	Correct it.
__label__en	Fix it.
__label__en	What is wisdom?
__label__en	As a child, I objected strongly to Nurse Wilks: and now, grown to riper years, the thought of meeting her again gives me the heeby-jeebies.
__label__en	The potatoes have almost finished boiling.
__label__en	The subject for the evening was "Black Cats and Four Leaf Clovers: Stories about Good and Bad Luck".
__label__en	He gave me five euros.
__label__en	Fido, place.
__label__en	The real-life Five Families were involved in drug trafficking from day one.
__label__en	Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera stopped a swerving shot by Bastian Schweinsteiger, but Mueller was there to collect the rebound and knock the ball home.
__label__en	Fido, heel!
__label__en	The Godfather lacks three-dimensional female characters.
__label__en	The electrolyte solution in a lithium-ion battery is designed to produce a flow of electrical charges between the cathode and anode.
__label__en	Trees were scarce in these cold, dry regions, so instead of using wood, these hardy humans made campfires by burning the bones of the big animals they hunted.
__label__en	He returned to his country shortly afterwards.
__label__en	He followed him in silence.
__label__en	In Sandton Square, a shopping space dominated by a huge statue of Nelson Mandela, an oinking, tail-wagging pig and a wide-eyed plastic soldier beating a drum compete for children’s attention as they race into a toy store in Johannesburg.
__label__en	"It looks like Tanaka got married." "Is that so?" "He posted a picture of him holding a baby next to a woman. Here, look." "You're right. They look happy, huh?"
__label__en	She was wearing a decidedly tight T-shirt.
__label__en	His gaze became serious.
__label__en	Fido, come!
__label__en	He worked on it all weekend.
__label__en	Fido, down!
__label__en	The doctor brought the report to his desk.
__label__en	The doctor read the report carefully.
__label__en	Babies start crying in the evening, so I was always carrying him on my back while making dinner.
__label__en	He didn't hide his satisfaction.
__label__en	Plus, Kenya ramps up efforts to control the twin challenges of COVID-19 and malaria.
__label__en	I don't think there's anything so difficult as recognizing one's own weakness.
__label__en	He'd put together all the necessary materials.
__label__en	We can say with certainty that the victim isn't Italian.
__label__en	Her phone trilled and she pulled it out to read the message.
__label__en	The area will have a population of about 70 million and the economic heft, state media argues, to drive the Chinese economy, let alone the world.
__label__en	She showed him a picture.
__label__en	He looks like a strange guy.
__label__en	He put his mobile phone back in his pocket.
__label__en	We are ten years apart, so what could it be?
__label__en	You'd certainly enjoy yourself.
__label__en	Don't give in without a fight.
__label__en	We'll go to them, it'll be an opportunity for you to meet them.
__label__en	Don't tell me there's no hope at all.
__label__en	We need to call a wildlife rehabilitator.
__label__en	Esther is a wildlife rehabilitator.
__label__en	For security and privacy reasons, I don't have Facebook on my phone.
__label__en	She ran to change her clothes.
__label__en	I think they have something to communicate to us.
__label__en	It's a good reason not to lose too much time.
__label__en	We're working together on the case.
__label__en	I have some news that might interest you.
__label__en	He came to tell me in person.
__label__en	His face was reddened by the sun.
__label__en	"Pietro is now a girl who calls himself Patricia." "Has he grown a vagina over the summer?"
__label__en	At least Tom can hold down a job.
__label__en	We won't keep making the same mistakes.
__label__en	We keep finding brand new mistakes to make.
__label__en	Why does there need to be a point to learning constructed languages?
__label__en	It's not a pejorative.
__label__en	Puppies are adorable.
__label__en	Baby animals are adorable.
__label__en	We can't wait until night.
__label__en	Aren't you Tom Jackson?
__label__en	He lowered his gaze, concentrating on the floor so as not to laugh.
__label__en	Do black holes lead anywhere?
__label__en	He seemed to have recovered from his embarrassment.
__label__en	Why is Tom coming with you?
__label__en	There aren't many languages like that.
__label__en	We don't have a rabbit.
__label__en	He let out a resounding laugh.
__label__en	I mostly write formal verse.
__label__en	That's okay, things are going to be okay.
__label__en	Let's order food.
__label__en	I didn't wake up very early this morning.
__label__en	The police tapped his mobile phone.
__label__en	Just put it wherever.
__label__en	People are capable of reason.
__label__en	Tom Jackson won't be speaking at the conference.
__label__en	Uranus is a strange planet.
__label__en	Tom was their interpreter.
__label__en	Wasn't Tom your interpreter?
__label__en	There's no need to change the wording.
__label__en	He took a few moments to reflect.
__label__en	I'm getting arthritis.
__label__en	He runs the cocaine trade.
__label__en	They're freshly made.
__label__en	At the moment we have no other leads to follow.
__label__en	I caught myself mindlessly scarfing down the freshly made food.
__label__en	She became serious for a moment.
__label__en	People say it's delicious hot out of the pan, but I can't eat it when it's that hot.
__label__en	He began to gesticulate.
__label__en	Tanaka only just recently became a newlywed.
__label__en	An old memory came back to haunt me. Ugh, I hate when this happens.
__label__en	Steal from national and international chain stores.
__label__en	The beginning is the most important part of any work.
__label__en	I took good care of my grandmother.
__label__en	We are at the gate.
__label__en	You can't keep me here forever.
__label__en	His gaze was fixed on her.
__label__en	It's my mother's smile.
__label__en	His thumbs were stuck in the pockets of his jeans.
__label__en	I didn't expect him to say that.
__label__en	Do you like art?
__label__en	He'd never protected her from the truth.
__label__en	He hadn't given her false hope.
__label__en	He never skirts around problems.
__label__en	She hugged a cushion.
__label__en	The idea of leaving that place suddenly made her anxious.
__label__en	He felt safe there.
__label__en	There are people who owe me favours.
__label__en	He's hunting you.
__label__en	We don't care about him.
__label__en	We must be prepared for every eventuality.
__label__en	He tried hard not to cry.
__label__en	Did you like the physics book?
__label__en	I miss your smell.
__label__en	I miss your scent.
__label__en	String theory is a hoax.
__label__en	String theory has been wildly overhyped by its researchers.
__label__en	Tom thought string theory was a fact of reality.
__label__en	String theory isn't testable.
__label__en	String theory is not even wrong.
__label__en	Please write your address on this register.
__label__en	I injured my left knee following this accident.
__label__en	She ate a quince.
__label__en	You have not tasted the chorba.
__label__en	You tasted the cake.
__label__en	His father is sad.
__label__en	Her father is sad.
__label__en	You transported the pebbles to At Sidi Said.
__label__en	You went back to Tibane.
__label__en	Lower the sound more.
__label__en	They don't want to accept me like as i am.
__label__en	Hey you ! Stop screaming!
__label__en	They know the way.
__label__en	They moved to Kherrata.
__label__en	He moved to Ichelladen.
__label__en	I went to a public garden to rest.
__label__en	He is talking in the phone.
__label__en	These painters are tired today.
__label__en	They are still at Tigzirt beach.
__label__en	They starved him to death.
__label__en	Mr. Sato called when you were away.
__label__en	She got on well with you.
__label__en	Who will succeed him?
__label__en	How does this door open?
__label__en	She couldn't forget him.
__label__en	No that's all.
__label__en	Take care of your self too.
__label__en	The devil take you!
__label__en	There isn't enough evidence.
__label__en	She snatched the binoculars out of his hands.
__label__en	It took him a few seconds to recover.
__label__en	Quick, let's move!
__label__en	"I can't believe it", he kept saying under his breath.
__label__en	They sat down on some moss-covered rocks.
__label__en	He was trying to put the pieces of the puzzle in place.
__label__en	He hadn't yet brought the whole situation into focus.
__label__en	He began to connect the things that had happened to him.
__label__en	I told you to shoot if things went south!
__label__en	And that's when things went south.
__label__en	He brought his fist under his chin.
__label__en	My sister has nothing to do with this.
__label__en	It all went south from there.
__label__en	It all went south very quickly.
__label__en	There is no place in the world like home.
__label__en	First, take a deep breath.
__label__en	Life is tough that way.
__label__en	He made an ironic grimace.
__label__en	If you want to make money, study English; but if you want to have friends, learn Esperanto.
__label__en	Wait until you get to know him well and you'll realise.
__label__en	You learn English to make money and Esperanto to make friends.
__label__en	I prefer to wait for a better opportunity.
__label__en	Tom had to recharge the battery.
__label__en	Tom reciprocated with a similar offer.
__label__en	He was totally unaware of what was happening.
__label__en	You learn English because you have to, Esperanto because you want to.
__label__en	I don't want to spread myself too thin.
__label__en	He was enjoying the sunshine filtering through the branches.
__label__en	I just turned seventeen.
__label__en	I'm tanned.
__label__en	Part of my cock was sticking out of the water.
__label__en	Let's go back, it'll be dark soon.
__label__en	Tonight I'll light the fire, we'll stay warm.
__label__en	How about I teach you to light the fire tonight?
__label__en	He came by whenever he was in town.
__label__en	He lived right next door.
__label__en	She'd taught me how to cook.
__label__en	Ring my bell.
__label__en	My favourite game was hide and seek.
__label__en	She rings my bell.
__label__en	I tickled the hell out of him.
__label__en	My favorite game is hide-and-seek.
__label__en	The disputants know instinctively that an outsider can see the difficulty better than an insider.
__label__en	A new personal home robot follows you around your home, navigating past obstacles, so you can multitask while staying connected.
__label__en	He was happy that he was no longer alone.
__label__en	Maybe he really is the right person.
__label__en	We'll have a great dinner.
__label__en	They couldn't find the right path.
__label__en	This large mustard family mostly has fruits known as a silique or silicle, which are pods that split into two valves; and yellow or white, rarely pinkish flowers.
__label__en	It is, therefore, almost exclusively seen in hysterics, neurotics and other types of psychopaths, in the frankly insane, and in grave delinquents.
__label__en	"Bridges right now last maybe 25-35 years before we have to replace their decks or superstructures," he notes.
__label__en	This custom dispenses with that rigorous constraint and reservedness which are practised by the women of other countries, and they go whithersoever they please, either alone or in company.
__label__en	I'm sorry, I don't know you.
__label__en	Mr. Bolanos is the third president to assume office since that time and the economy continues to be the main concern of most Nicaraguans.
__label__en	More universality or extensiveness is, then, one mark which the philosopher's conceptions must possess.
__label__en	They also theorized that the megalithic stones may have been transported 290 kilometers overland from the quarries in Wales to the prehistoric monument.
__label__en	In France, truffle hunters historically relied on the keen noses of pigs, while Italy is home to a special breed of truffle dog.
__label__en	I want you to think about what might have happened.
__label__en	Tom assured us of having everything under control.
__label__en	The mountain is treacherous if you don't know it like the back of your hand.
__label__en	He was completely disoriented.
__label__en	I saw you washing your lorry today.
__label__en	We're lost, damn!
__label__en	She was quite unaware that I was spying on her.
__label__en	There was only pitch blackness around me.
__label__en	I was watching him from the first floor window.
__label__en	I can't wait to leave this shitty place.
__label__en	I ended up in this shitty place.
__label__en	At this time of day, the subway is packed.
__label__en	He will not die in his sleep, but hang.
__label__en	Too much bread makes you sick.
__label__en	Does this man need a wheelchair?
__label__en	For him, it's a way of running away from the harsh reality.
__label__en	He was completely alone; there wasn't a soul who lived in the vicinity.
__label__en	I was hiding behind the curtains.
__label__en	He was beginning to worry about himself.
__label__en	Good afternoon. Nice to meet you.
__label__en	The others have already licked the bottom of the pot.
__label__en	She just wanders around.
__label__en	He just wanders around.
__label__en	I have nightmares every night, i wonder why.
__label__en	I have nightmares at night.
__label__en	He was captured by pirates.
__label__en	Tomorrow (04.30), we will have tiebreakers – four 25-minute games with 10 seconds of added time per move for each player, followed, if necessary, by "blitzes" until the decision – to meet the new World Chess Champion. The 14-game match ended today at a 7-7 point tie.
__label__en	Niger is a good country, I used to live there.
__label__en	His words came back to my mind.
__label__en	He sensed that his father didn't want to tell him everything.
__label__en	They waited for a few days but nobody came.
__label__en	Let a few days pass.
__label__en	Go to bed now, we'll talk tomorrow.
__label__en	I went and hid in the barn.
__label__en	You can see for yourself.
__label__en	We only buy what we need.
__label__en	Sleep well, darling.
__label__en	Take an egg.
__label__en	You ate figs.
__label__en	She touched me.
__label__en	His death touched me so much.
__label__en	He doesn't stop being arrogant, especially when you flatter him.
__label__en	It's time to create a Kabyle academy.
__label__en	He has questions for you.
__label__en	When will I go back to school?
__label__en	Goodbye friends.
__label__en	You are not trustworthy!
__label__en	Where did my youth go?
__label__en	Take a peach.
__label__en	Tom unlocked the supply closet.
__label__en	Drinking water is in short supply.
__label__en	Water and food are in short supply.
__label__en	Manpower was in short supply.
__label__en	Time is in short supply.
__label__en	It's a matter of supply and demand.
__label__en	It's a simple matter of supply and demand.
__label__en	It's all about supply and demand.
__label__en	The supply ship will be here next week.
__label__en	The demand remains far ahead of supply.
__label__en	Food is in short supply here.
__label__en	Food was in very short supply.
__label__en	The medicine we need is in short supply.
__label__en	The current supply isn't enough to meet the demand.
__label__en	We supplied Tom with everything he needed.
__label__en	I have a life-time supply of those.
__label__en	Prices go up when demand exceeds supply.
__label__en	I'm going on maternity leave from 30th September to 14th October.
__label__en	I'll be on maternity leave from 30 September to 14 October.
__label__en	Here's something you might be interested in. It's a website that provides a guide to English Grammar from a British English perspective. I recommend it. I believe it was created by a Hungarian who teaches English at the University of Szeged (although you wouldn't know that unless you looked at the About page).
__label__en	I've put some links in my profile to sources I use myself to check my English. They're all good for British English.
__label__en	"Is something the matter?" "That was going to be my question."
__label__en	I can't find my glasses. Help me look for them!
__label__en	His dream was not to come true.
__label__en	Her dream was not to come true.
__label__en	It's always nice to hear from you.
__label__en	We're not in the eighties any more.
__label__en	Could I see your boarding pass?
__label__en	This bakery still makes everything by hand, without using any baking mixes.
__label__en	I thought it'd be easier this way.
__label__en	I thought it'd be easier that way.
__label__en	I thought it would be easier this way.
__label__en	"Is that fridge new?" "No, we've had it for years. It's just hard to recognise now that Mary's covered it with tinfoil."
__label__en	Finally, he began to cry.
__label__en	At last he started to cry.
__label__en	Could you explain how food absorption takes place?
__label__en	"Is she your new girlfriend?" "No!" "Explain, then."
__label__en	Ziri and Rima went to wash their hands.
__label__en	I am a schoolboy.
__label__en	I'm a schoolboy.
__label__en	I am not a club member.
__label__en	I'm not a club member.
__label__en	She is not a member of the club.
__label__en	She isn't a member of the club.
__label__en	She is not a club member.
__label__en	She isn't a club member.
__label__en	He bent down to pick up a stone.
__label__en	He heard the rustle of a bush.
__label__en	You are not a member of the club.
__label__en	You are not a club member.
__label__en	You aren't a member of the club.
__label__en	You aren't a club member.
__label__en	He is not a member of the club.
__label__en	He wondered if the man was armed.
__label__en	He isn't a member of the club.
__label__en	He is not a club member.
__label__en	He isn't a club member.
__label__en	He threw the stone far away.
__label__en	They are not members of the club.
__label__en	The thief lost the policemen.
__label__en	They aren't members of the club.
__label__en	They are not club members.
__label__en	They aren't club members.
__label__en	We are not members of the club.
__label__en	We aren't members of the club.
__label__en	We are not club members.
__label__en	He bent down to catch his breath.
__label__en	We aren't club members.
__label__en	He realised he'd left the house open and unattended.
__label__en	Tom has an important piece of information for us.
__label__en	The implemented change hasn't brought any improvement.
__label__en	Pietro grew up on a farm in Bejaia, Algeria.
__label__en	Mouloud Mammeri was an Algerian writer and anthropologist.
__label__en	Melissa is a mother of five.
__label__en	Melissa stays home, raising the kids.
__label__en	Adriano usually goes shopping at ten.
__label__en	Adriano needs to give as much context as possible.
__label__en	Adriano went shopping one day.
__label__en	Adriano hurried over to the store with his coupons.
__label__en	Adriano has to go shopping with his five-year-old daughter.
__label__en	Adriano went shopping alone.
__label__en	Adriano grabbed whatever was on his shopping list.
__label__en	Adriano came and grabbed whatever was on sale.
__label__en	Adriano had jeans on.
__label__en	Adriano apologized for startling Melissa.
__label__en	Adriano checked the aisle but couldn't find chips.
__label__en	Adriano smiled and walked back to his truck.
__label__en	Adriano told Melissa why he liked those chips so much.
__label__en	Adriano didn't get the hint.
__label__en	Adriano told Melissa that she was pretty.
__label__en	Adriano went to his truck.
__label__en	Adriano kept talking to Melissa.
__label__en	Adriano seemed to get the hint.
__label__en	Adriano kept seeing that man circling the aisles.
__label__en	Adriano stopped and just looked down at Melissa.
__label__en	Adriano was finally done.
__label__en	Adriano went to the check-out.
__label__en	Adriano felt Melissa's gaze.
__label__en	Adriano pushed his cart away.
__label__en	Adriano was unloading his cart.
__label__en	Adriano was walking to his truck.
__label__en	Adriano didn't turn the truck on. He just sat in it.
__label__en	Adriano looked in his rear-view mirror.
__label__en	Adriano had his headlights off.
__label__en	Adriano was driving with his headlights off.
__label__en	Melissa was followed home by a creep.
__label__en	Adriano's truck was already gone.
__label__en	Adriano heard some shuffling in the side yard.
__label__en	Adriano heard the window slide open.
__label__en	Adriano grabbed a baseball bat from under the bed.
__label__en	Adriano tried to chase after the truck.
__label__en	He'd never seen anyone sleeping so soundly.
__label__en	Adriano phoned the police and they arrived in under five minutes.
__label__en	Adriano saw John chasing Melissa's van.
__label__en	Adriano worked at Target.
__label__en	Adriano was put on an overnight shift.
__label__en	Adriano was off Tuesdays and Thursdays.
__label__en	Adriano was scheduled for a Thursday night.
__label__en	Adriano felt sick seeing that.
__label__en	Adriano was over fourteen.
__label__en	Adriano considered quitting, but he needed the job and the money.
__label__en	Half the lights were off to save on electricity.
__label__en	Adriano's store was completely dead.
__label__en	There were fewer and fewer customers.
__label__en	There hasn't been a customer in over an hour.
__label__en	Adriano could be a manager.
__label__en	Adriano had five keys on his keyring.
__label__en	Is Adriano the manager?
__label__en	Adriano shook Melissa's hand without giving her his name.
__label__en	Adriano watched the front of the store.
__label__en	Adriano walked towards the back of the store.
__label__en	Adriano was locking the door.
__label__en	Adriano was wearing a manager's vest.
__label__en	Adriano thought Melissa was the manager.
__label__en	Adriano described that man.
__label__en	Adriano was the only manager on dury.
__label__en	All the lights in the store turned off.
__label__en	Adriano walked into the darkness of the warehouse.
__label__en	Adriano was on his phone, trying to text Melissa.
__label__en	Adriano heard the door to the warehouse opening.
__label__en	Adriano walked back into the store.
__label__en	Adriano hurried out of the store.
__label__en	Adriano called out Melissa's name. Nothing.
__label__en	Adriano tried to physically open the door, but it was locked.
__label__en	Adriano said that in a panic.
__label__en	Adriano heard the whole conversation.
__label__en	Adriano was probably trying to rob the place.
__label__en	Adriano went to his truck and left.
__label__en	Adriano went inside his truck.
__label__en	Adriano watched for a little while.
__label__en	Adriano didn't quit after that.
__label__en	Adriano wanted to work.
__label__en	Adriano was circling the place, looking suspicious.
__label__en	Adriano cut the light in the store.
__label__en	Adriano left through the emergency exit.
__label__en	Adriano never worked that shift again.
__label__en	Adriano worked as a night restock worker at Target.
__label__en	The store will close at five.
__label__en	Adriano was restocking the shelves.
__label__en	Adriano had the keys to the store.
__label__en	Adriano was supposed to be working with Melissa.
__label__en	Adriano started his work at five.
__label__en	Adriano hasn't seen Melissa yet.
__label__en	Adriano left his belongings in the warehouse.
__label__en	Adriano went back to work for another half hour.
__label__en	Adriano noticed the back door was shut.
__label__en	Adriano wanted to open the back door.
__label__en	Adriano called Melissa's name and it echoed through the room.
__label__en	Adriano asked Melissa if she was at work.
__label__en	Suddenly, Adriano got the chills.
__label__en	Adriano wasn't scheduled to work that night.
__label__en	Adriano did a quick look around.
__label__en	Adriano needed to go back to work.
__label__en	Adriano heard a loud sound echo from across the shopping floor.
__label__en	The middle aisle intersected all the other aisles.
__label__en	Adriano looked down in Melissa's direction.
__label__en	Adriano started to speedwalk down the central aisle.
__label__en	Adriano was waiting at the end of the aisle.
__label__en	Adriano walked out of sight.
__label__en	Adriano didn't get a good look at Melissa's face.
__label__en	Adriano saw Melissa all the way at the end, by the bread aisle.
__label__en	Adriano disappeared behind the cars.
__label__en	The homeless guy was removed from the store.
__label__en	Adriano greeted the officer and asked him to follow him inside the warehouse.
__label__en	The police officer commanded Adriano to come here and he listened.
__label__en	Adriano was looking at Melissa, smiling at her and licking his lips.
__label__en	The police officer walked Adriano outside to the police car.
__label__en	Adriano never left any doors or windows open again.
__label__en	He lay down on his side of the bed.
__label__en	The blankets were too heavy and he felt hot.
__label__en	Adriano went to an amusement park with a few of his friends.
__label__en	Adriano wasn't a huge fan of amusement parks.
__label__en	Adriano entered the amusement park.
__label__en	Adriano has never been there before.
__label__en	Adriano didn't have any interest in going on the rides.
__label__en	Adriano went on a rollercoaster with Melissa.
__label__en	Adriano walked over to the rollercoaster.
__label__en	The amusement park was a little crowded.
__label__en	Adriano was standing around.
__label__en	Adriano was sitting on one of the benches, staring at Melissa.
__label__en	Adriano looked again and saw Melissa still looking right at him.
__label__en	Adriano sat with his friend, Melissa.
__label__en	Adriano was a little bit creeped out.
__label__en	Adriano sat at a picnic table.
__label__en	Adriano wasn't overly concerned about that guy.
__label__en	Adriano hasn't seen Melissa for several hours.
__label__en	Adriano noticed the man again.
__label__en	Adriano was kind of concerned.
__label__en	Adriano left the gift shop.
__label__en	Adriano walked to the exit.
__label__en	Adriano was almost in his truck.
__label__en	Adriano saw the man again.
__label__en	Adriano was pretty far away.
__label__en	Adriano and Melissa were arguing about where to eat.
__label__en	Adriano wasn't far from Melissa's truck.
__label__en	Without his help we'd have stood no chance at all.
__label__en	Adriano was trying to follow Melissa in his truck.
__label__en	Adriano was in a much more dangerous situation.
__label__en	Adriano sat there, waiting for Melissa to leave.
__label__en	Adriano drove home, trying to lose the cops.
__label__en	Adriano kept an eye on Melissa's truck.
__label__en	Adriano found a security guard near the entrance.
__label__en	Adriano walked back to the parking lot.
__label__en	The security guard started to approach Adriano's vehicle.
__label__en	Adriano waited for a minute and then he left.
__label__en	Adriano tried to follow Melissa in his truck.
__label__en	Adriano was specifically following Melissa.
__label__en	Adriano never saw that man again after that.
__label__en	Adriano never went back to that amusement park.
__label__en	Adriano remembers this pretty well.
__label__en	Adriano went to a popular amusement park in Algiers.
__label__en	Adriano always liked going on rides.
__label__en	Adriano went on a few rides.
__label__en	Adriano wanted to go on a different ride.
__label__en	Adriano went on the rollercoaster.
__label__en	The rollercoaster went upside down.
__label__en	The rollercoaster wasn't that fast.
__label__en	Adriano was watching the rollercoaster.
__label__en	The rollercoaster passed Adriano.
__label__en	Adriano made eye contact with Melissa specifically.
__label__en	Adriano waved at Melissa.
__label__en	Adriano was just trying to scare Melissa.
__label__en	Adriano was just trying to be funny by scaring Melissa.
__label__en	Adriano went on the swing ride.
__label__en	Adriano wanted to go on the bumper car ride.
__label__en	Adriano wanted to catch Melissa.
__label__en	Adriano didn't notice Melissa anywhere and was happy about that.
__label__en	Adriano didn't see Melissa again for the rest of the day.
__label__en	I wished that it was the last time that I saw Adriano.
__label__en	Adriano had his own bedroom.
__label__en	Is there any chance of us winning such a war?
__label__en	Adriano's bedroom was in the back side of the house.
__label__en	The lights in Adriano's bedroom were off.
__label__en	He took off the bottom piece of his pyjamas while remaining in his underwear.
__label__en	A bug flew into the window.
__label__en	It happened again less than thirty seconds later.
__label__en	Adriano walked over to the window.
__label__en	Adriano was smiling in a very creepy way.
__label__en	Adriano motioned for Melissa to come down.
__label__en	Adriano luckily heard Melissa and came to her room.
__label__en	Adriano is now in the backyard.
__label__en	Adriano called the police after hearing that.
__label__en	Adriano felt dumb for not calling the police.
__label__en	Adriano was making a creepy face at Melissa's daughter.
__label__en	Adriano saw Melissa standing at the window.
__label__en	Adriano never saw that man again.
__label__en	Adriano still doesn't know why Melissa didn't do that.
__label__en	Adriano followed Melissa home from Target.
__label__en	Adriano used to work at an amusement park.
__label__en	Adriano didn't get paid much.
__label__en	Adriano worked in a little food booth.
__label__en	Adriano's work wasn't that difficult.
__label__en	Adriano was working late at night.
__label__en	Adriano was the only person working in that food booth.
__label__en	Adriano could finally relax in the last half hour.
__label__en	Adriano was a park employee.
__label__en	Adriano was walking through the amusement park to leave.
__label__en	There were lots of employees.
__label__en	Adriano kept walking over towards the security guard.
__label__en	Adriano was carrying a heavy box.
__label__en	Adriano was pretty sure he could lift that box.
__label__en	There was a gate that was open and led out.
__label__en	Adriano has very rarely seen anybody use that gate.
__label__en	Adriano exited the park.
__label__en	Adriano was walking down a quiet road.
__label__en	It's over, I no longer see any chance for us.
__label__en	Adriano walked down the small path.
__label__en	Adriano made it to his truck.
__label__en	Adriano put the box inside the truck.
__label__en	Adriano wanted Melissa to get inside.
__label__en	Adriano was still approaching Melissa.
__label__en	Adriano was also approaching.
__label__en	Adriano almost caught up to Melissa.
__label__en	Adriano ran down the quiet road.
__label__en	Adriano made it a good distance down the road before the cops finally caught him.
__label__en	Adriano heard the doors open.
__label__en	Adriano was laying on the ground behind a large tree.
__label__en	Adriano heard the doors open and close again.
__label__en	Adriano reported everything to the police as well as to the park.
__label__en	Adriano was at work again.
__label__en	Adriano saw one of the guys from before.
__label__en	Adriano was sitting on a bench by himself.
__label__en	Adriano grabbed his phone to call the park security.
__label__en	Adriano left before he could be found.
__label__en	He turned to his side, his face facing the window.
__label__en	He headed for the door.
__label__en	He thrust his hand under the pillow.
__label__en	His hands were under the pillow.

__label__pl	Na pewno potrzebujemy więcej treningu.
__label__pl	Rzeczy nie są takie dobre jak kiedyś.
__label__pl	Musisz kogoś oskarżyć.
__label__pl	Tom w końcu się uspokoił.
__label__pl	Może będziesz musiała to zrobić.
__label__pl	Tom jeszcze nie spotkał dzieci Mary.
__label__pl	Ludzie dalej chcą to robić.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział że czuje się odrzucony.
__label__pl	Tom nie je aż tyle co Mary.
__label__pl	Sami jest z powrotem w domu.
__label__pl	Czemu mi tego nie powiedziałaś wcześniej?
__label__pl	On nigdy by się nie zabił.
__label__pl	Jak się dowiedziałaś że Tom tego nie lubi.
__label__pl	Tom jest sarkastyczny, co nie?
__label__pl	Witaj przyjacielu! Dawno się nie widzieliśmy!
__label__pl	Ona powiedziała mi że może to zrobić.
__label__pl	Tom już wydał wszystkie pieniądze które zostawił my ojciec.
__label__pl	Chciałam żeby Tom zrozumiał że nie możemy razem żyć.
__label__pl	Chciałem żeby Tom poszedł do marketu i kupił trochę mleka.
__label__pl	To nie idzie tak dobrze.
__label__pl	Nie mogę przestać myśleć że tom powinien być tu z nami.
__label__pl	Mary ma już osiemdziesiąt siedem lat.
__label__pl	Czy ty naprawdę nie rozumiesz?
__label__pl	Tom myśli że Mary nie będzie zazdrosna.
__label__pl	Marie urosła.
__label__pl	Musi być coś co mi pomoże.
__label__pl	Ona żyje z rodzicami.
__label__pl	Czy to twoje dziecko?
__label__pl	Ja nie otworzyłem tych drzwi.
__label__pl	Tej nocy on uciekł z Algerii.
__label__pl	Mary szybko pływa, co nie?
__label__pl	Nie myślałam że wrócisz tak szybko.
__label__pl	Mary zapytała Toma o jego opinie.
__label__pl	Twoja ciężka praca się opłaciła.
__label__pl	To jeszcze nie koniec histori.
__label__pl	On naprawdę nie lubił swojej pracy.
__label__pl	Weźmy coś do jedzenia wracając do domu.
__label__pl	Na twoim miejscu nie sprzedawał bym tej ziemi.
__label__pl	Ona pocałowała mnie w policzek i powiedziała dobranoc.
__label__pl	To zawsze był problem.
__label__pl	Tom nie mógł podróżować do Australii.
__label__pl	To idzie na moją listę życzeń.
__label__pl	Tom nie robi rzeczy tak jak ja.
__label__pl	To nie wszystko co musimy zrobić.
__label__pl	Nigdy jeszcze czegoś takiego nie robiłam.
__label__pl	Tom miał tylko 3 lata jak przyszedł do Boston.
__label__pl	Miałem nadzieję że będę mógł to zrobić.
__label__pl	Czy chciałbyś coś dodać do tego co powiedziałam?
__label__pl	Te kolory są piękne.
__label__pl	Tom nigdy nie miał dzieci.
__label__pl	Tom umie powiedzieć dobranoc w trzech językach.
__label__pl	Chce żeby Tom wiedział że naprawde nie chce tego robić
__label__pl	Chce żeby Tom zrozumiał że dlaczego on nie może żyć w z nami.
__label__pl	Ten hotel wydaje się pusty.
__label__pl	Tom mówi prawde.
__label__pl	Włoski to mój język ojczysty.
__label__pl	Ona była dobrym artystą i fotografem.
__label__pl	Przepraszam wszystkich.
__label__pl	Więc, Tom, dzisiaj jest twój szczęśliwy dzień.
__label__pl	On zapomniał jej imię.
__label__pl	Oni mieli trochę.
__label__pl	Nie możemy powiedzieć Tomowi.
__label__pl	Dlaczego go uderzyłaś.
__label__pl	Nie jest za późno żeby zadzwonić do Toma.
__label__pl	Lubiłbyś to.
__label__pl	To była niesamowita bitwa.
__label__pl	To nie wie co Mary ma zrobić.
__label__pl	Tom myślał że to dobre rozwiązanie.
__label__pl	Tom nie jest pewien co ma robić.
__label__pl	Tom to naprawi.
__label__pl	Oni poszli do swoich sypialni.
__label__pl	Wszyscy lubią puszyste ręczniki.
__label__pl	On źle myje ręczniki.
__label__pl	Myj swoje ręczniki.
__label__pl	Jego ręczniki są twarde.
__label__pl	To jest ręczniki czy papier ścierny?
__label__pl	Prosze daj mi miękki ręcznik.
__label__pl	Kocham miękkie ręczniki.
__label__pl	Nie pije często piwa.
__label__pl	Czy jesteś zajęta?
__label__pl	Nie lubię poniedziałków.
__label__pl	Jestem roztargniony.
__label__pl	On zranił swoją żonę nożem.
__label__pl	Nigdy nie będę jak oni.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział że granie w gry komputerowe to tak nie prawde nie starta czasu.
__label__pl	Tom wczoraj wypił za dużo herbaty.
__label__pl	Chce wypić twoją krew w północ.
__label__pl	Uwielbiam pomagać ludziom którzy są ambitni.
__label__pl	Uwielbiam pomagać ludziom którzy uczą się języków.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział mi że potrzebuje aż 30 kocy.
__label__pl	Tom nie potrafi się powstrzymać od krytykowania Mary kiedy się spotykają.
__label__pl	Mary ma trzy kilogramy nasion sezamu w szafce i nikomu nie chce dać.
__label__pl	Tom macha butelką na sygnał że skończył.
__label__pl	Tom jest uzależniony od narkotyków ale nikomu tego nie powie.
__label__pl	Orzeszki ziemne to nie orzechy, ale rośliny strączkowe.
__label__pl	Tom kłamie do siebie że jest zdrowy, ale narkotyki niszczą jego zdrowie.
__label__pl	Jem kuskus.
__label__pl	Ja naprawde chce dla niego dobrze ale on nie chce współpracować.
__label__pl	Ona zjadła wszystkie słodycze.
__label__pl	Mam dosyć latających pianin.
__label__pl	Te nowoczesne butelki mnie irytują.
__label__pl	Mam dosyć niskiej jakości kabli do ładowania telefonów.
__label__pl	Mam dosyć niskiej jakości jedzenia w tej restauracji.
__label__pl	To jest najniższej jakości jedzenie jakie kiedykolwiek jadłam.
__label__pl	Do czego chcesz używać tego komputera?
__label__pl	Moi rodzice ciągle krytykują nowoczesną technologię. Oni jej nie rozumieją.
__label__pl	Musicie użyć narzędzi.
__label__pl	Tom kolekcjonuje przypinki i ma już aż sto.
__label__pl	Tom uwielbia przypinki.
__label__pl	Tom dał Mary przypinkę z okazji jej urodzin.
__label__pl	Tom nie zasłużył na taki honor, on tylko pogłaskał pieska.
__label__pl	Czy mogłabyś nauczyć mnie angielskiego.
__label__pl	On dostał naklejkę z jego imieniem.
__label__pl	Tom przedawkował leki i teraz ma straszną gorączkę.
__label__pl	Tom jak jest głodny to je jedzenie. On myśli że to normalne.
__label__pl	Tom nie jadł nic od tygodnia, teraz jest chory.
__label__pl	Tom to maszyna do dobrych pomysłów.
__label__pl	Tom nigdy nie będzie miał dosyć wody.
__label__pl	To wydaje się dziwne, nigdy taki nie był.
__label__pl	Jestem z powrotem w mgnieniu oka.
__label__pl	Tom to idiota na następnym poziomie.
__label__pl	Tom ma dosyć drżących się idiotów.
__label__pl	Orzechy są pożywne.
__label__pl	Tom popadł w cztery uzależnienia.
__label__pl	To jedzenie jest bardzo pożywne.
__label__pl	Idę coś zjeść, ale zaraz wrócę.
__label__pl	Muszę coś zjeść, zaraz wrócę.
__label__pl	Czy ty jesteś uzależniony od ręczników?
__label__pl	On jest uzależniony od ręczników.
__label__pl	Tom poszedł do lekarza aby wyjść ze swojego uzależnienia.
__label__pl	Tom ma dosyć bycia uzależnionym.
__label__pl	Mary chce nauczyć się Japońskiego, dlatego jej tu niema.
__label__pl	Świat byłby prostszy gdyby każdy znał angielski.
__label__pl	Uwielbiam uczyć się języków.
__label__pl	Kocham uczyć się języków.
__label__pl	Tom nie wierzy w uzależniania.
__label__pl	Tom to straszna świnia ale nie chce się przyznać.
__label__pl	Tom uważa Mary za jego dziewczynę.
__label__pl	Mary myśli że Tom nie jest za mądry.
__label__pl	Mary ma dosyć wymówek Toma.
__label__pl	Mary powiedziała Tomowi że zrywają.
__label__pl	To jest chore, weź przestań.
__label__pl	Mary ma dosyć Toma więc zerwali ze sobą.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział Mary że ją nie kocha.
__label__pl	Tom uwielbia tą nową piosenkę "baby shark".
__label__pl	Tom często się myli ale nie chce się do tego przyznać.
__label__pl	Tom często się myli ale ci tego nie powie.
__label__pl	Tom nie jest specjalistą od uzależnień, to oczywiste.
__label__pl	Tom nie wie prawie nic o uzależnieniach.
__label__pl	Tom jak bardzo głodny ale i tak nic nie je.
__label__pl	Muszę już iść bo jestem bardzo głodny.
__label__pl	Tom nie wierzy mi że jest uzależniony.
__label__pl	Mary marnuje swój czas pomagając innym.
__label__pl	Mary ma pomysł jak wyciągnąć Toma z jego uzależnienia.
__label__pl	Mary próbuje wyjaśnić Tomowi że jest uzależniony ale on jej nie wierzy.
__label__pl	Tom uwielbia napoje gazowane trochę za bardzo.
__label__pl	Tom lubi ser ale ma już go dość.
__label__pl	Tom martwi się o biedne zwierzątka.
__label__pl	Tom uważa jego prace za najbezpieczniejszą.
__label__pl	Tom nie jest pewien czy Mary naprawde ma racje.
__label__pl	Tom to jest fajny gościu.
__label__pl	Tom to nie jest pijak, on tylko pije w weekend.
__label__pl	Tom nie pił alkoholu od tygodnia.
__label__pl	Tom zaczyna radzić sobie z uzależnieniem.
__label__pl	Mary jest dumna ze starań Toma.
__label__pl	Mary kocha Toma nastawianie do uzależnień.
__label__pl	Mary nie kocha Toma, źle mnie zrozumiałeś.
__label__pl	Czy wszystko ok?
__label__pl	To prawda że jest młody, ale ma dużo sensu.
__label__pl	Pierwotnie byli rolnikami.
__label__pl	Tom stosuje niskotłuszczową, wysokobiałkową dietę.
__label__pl	Jaka jest zaleta tej technologii?
__label__pl	To ma zbyt wiele wad.
__label__pl	Marchew zawiera dużo witaminy A.
__label__pl	Czy ona przyjdzie?
__label__pl	Zirytowała go.
__label__pl	Ona jest elegancka.
__label__pl	Jest pan lekarzem?
__label__pl	Swędzi mnie nos.
__label__pl	Ona wyszła.
__label__pl	Proszę wróć.
__label__pl	Wróćcie proszę.
__label__pl	Dzisiaj zjedliśmy sałatkę z makreli, sardynek i czarnych oliwek.
__label__pl	Żeglujesz dziś po południu?
__label__pl	Jesteśmy w drodze.
__label__pl	Pomoc jest w drodze.
__label__pl	Odłożyć broń!
__label__pl	Burzę tę starą ścianę.
__label__pl	Chcę się napić szampana.
__label__pl	Tom zaproponował Mary lampkę szampana.
__label__pl	Obawiam się, że mam wewnętrzne krwawienie.
__label__pl	Czuję wewnętrzną pustkę.
__label__pl	Ten pierścień stracił swój blask.
__label__pl	Jego powierzchnia była gładka jak lustro.
__label__pl	Około jednej trzeciej powierzchni ziemi to ląd.
__label__pl	Ten stół ma gładką powierzchnię.
__label__pl	Tom rozpalił ognisko.
__label__pl	Tańczyli wokół ogniska.
__label__pl	Marnujemy cenny czas.
__label__pl	Gdzie jest najbliższy bar?
__label__pl	Kiedy odjeżdża następny pociąg?
__label__pl	Będziemy kontynuować w przyszłym tygodniu.
__label__pl	Ostrze było bardzo ostre.
__label__pl	Myślałem, że to cię rozśmieszy.
__label__pl	Chodźmy na dworzec i kupmy bilety.
__label__pl	Tom nadal uważa, że jestem dzieckiem.
__label__pl	Nie zapomnij wynieść śmieci!
__label__pl	Dzisiejsi lekarze nie otrzymują dobrego wykształcenia.
__label__pl	On wie, jak myć zęby.
__label__pl	Nie jest konieczne, żeby Tom o tym wiedział.
__label__pl	Nie obchodzi mnie to, dopóki jesteś szczęśliwy.
__label__pl	Pan nie ma pojęcia, co się stało, prawda?
__label__pl	Postanowiłem pojechać pociągiem.
__label__pl	Wy nie macie pojęcia, co się stało, prawda?
__label__pl	Nie masz pojęcia, co się stało, prawda?
__label__pl	W pracy śpię na ramieniu.
__label__pl	Co wiesz o tym, co się stało?
__label__pl	Co wiecie o tym, co się stało?
__label__pl	Co pan wie o tym, co się stało?
__label__pl	Desperacko szukam mieszkania w centrum miasta.
__label__pl	Powiedziałem Tomowi, że powinien zostać.
__label__pl	Przypuszczam, że złamałem żebro.
__label__pl	Myślę, że zrobiłeś to dobrze.
__label__pl	Czy widzisz różnicę pomiędzy tymi dwoma obrazami?
__label__pl	Gdybym to wiedział, nie przyszedłbym.
__label__pl	Autobus się zatrzymał, ale nikt nie wysiadł.
__label__pl	Nie będzie mnie tu przez jakiś czas.
__label__pl	Przeważnie wracaliśmy z pustymi rękami.
__label__pl	Badacze odkryli szkielet w jaskini.
__label__pl	Wyglądasz, jakbyś był policjantem.
__label__pl	Spadło tylko kilka kropel deszczu.
__label__pl	Styczeń jest pierwszym miesiącem roku.
__label__pl	Widzicie ten dom? To jest mój dom
__label__pl	Nie wstydzę się tego, kim jestem.
__label__pl	Tom zazwyczaj pracuje od dziewiątej do wpół do szóstej,
__label__pl	Tom ma przyjaciela, którego ojciec jest astronautą.
__label__pl	Jeśli jesz za dużo, przytyjesz.
__label__pl	Skradziono mi portfel w autobusie.
__label__pl	Mierzyłem swoją temperaturę co sześć godzin.
__label__pl	Nie ma sensu czekać, aż on przyjdzie.
__label__pl	Wypij wszystko, aby nic nie zostało w środku.
__label__pl	Teraz jestem za stary, aby biegać.
__label__pl	Chcesz iść ze mną na koncert?
__label__pl	Wolę biegać niż jeździć konno.
__label__pl	Piętnaście osób zostało rannych w wypadku.
__label__pl	Moim zdaniem, to nie jest dobry pomysł.
__label__pl	Czasami razem oglądają film.
__label__pl	Nie miałem innego wyboru niż zostać.
__label__pl	Dowiedziałem się, dlaczego ta maszyna nie działała.
__label__pl	Z tą maszyną jest coś nie w porządku.
__label__pl	Wszyscy chłopcy w klasie ciężko pracowali.
__label__pl	Proponuję, abyśmy wyszli w piątek.
__label__pl	Co robiłeś przez cały ten czas?
__label__pl	Kiedy się uczysz?
__label__pl	Kiedy się uczycie?
__label__pl	Potraficie pływać?
__label__pl	Czy muszę się przesiąść?
__label__pl	Przyszło czterdzieści osób.
__label__pl	Ona jest miła.
__label__pl	Rozumiem to.
__label__pl	Mieszkałeś tutaj?
__label__pl	Mieszkaliście tutaj?
__label__pl	Jedźcie autobusem.
__label__pl	On nienawidzi pająków.
__label__pl	Ona jest bardziej znana niż ty.
__label__pl	Ona jest sławniejsza niż ty.
__label__pl	Zrób głośniej telewizor.
__label__pl	Czy możemy tu pływać?
__label__pl	Śpiewałem.
__label__pl	Muszę coś z tobą omówić.
__label__pl	Czy mogę otworzyć jedną puszkę?
__label__pl	To są moje rzeczy.
__label__pl	Ten tutaj jest w porządku.
__label__pl	Nie wiem, jak on się nazywa.
__label__pl	Musicie zacząć!
__label__pl	Nienawidzę gadów.
__label__pl	Jesteś kibicem?
__label__pl	Potrzebuję trochę mleka.
__label__pl	Martwię się o to.
__label__pl	Chmury ciemnieją.
__label__pl	Tom jest biedny.
__label__pl	Kupiłeś sok?
__label__pl	Potrzebuję tego do jutra.
__label__pl	Chcę wiedzieć, dlaczego tu jestem.
__label__pl	Muszę z tobą o tym porozmawiać.
__label__pl	Zapłacę.
__label__pl	To może być śmiertelne.
__label__pl	Czy Tom cię znalazł?
__label__pl	Tom nie umrze z głodu.
__label__pl	Tom nie będzie głodował.
__label__pl	Wszyscy idziemy razem.
__label__pl	Czy pan jest bez pracy?
__label__pl	Czy jest tu twoja matka?
__label__pl	Chcecie lody?
__label__pl	Nie należą do mnie.
__label__pl	Czy to działało?
__label__pl	Niech mnie pan nie obraża!
__label__pl	Ona dobrze śpiewa.
__label__pl	Też za tobą tęsknimy.
__label__pl	Możesz to załatwić?
__label__pl	Pomogłem Tomowi.
__label__pl	Nareszcie to zrobiliśmy.
__label__pl	Chcę to samo.
__label__pl	Podłoga jest mokra i śliska.
__label__pl	Spróbuj mnie złapać.
__label__pl	To sporo kosztowało.
__label__pl	Dlaczego dostałem trójkę?
__label__pl	Znalazłeś go.
__label__pl	Chcesz wejść?
__label__pl	Tom jest ze mną.
__label__pl	Dziękuję, że do mnie przyszedłeś.
__label__pl	Wejdź na pokład.
__label__pl	Nie potrafimy pomóc Tomowi.
__label__pl	Kto mówił?
__label__pl	Co się teraz dzieje?
__label__pl	Gdzie chcesz iść?
__label__pl	Ona je słodycze.
__label__pl	Sprzedałem książkę.
__label__pl	Atlas samochodowy proszę.
__label__pl	Chciałem więcej.
__label__pl	Tom nienawidzi szkoły.
__label__pl	Czy możemy umówić się na następny tydzień?
__label__pl	Ona studiuje matematykę.
__label__pl	Oni piją mleko.
__label__pl	Pan pije mleko.
__label__pl	Tom kupił kapelusz.
__label__pl	Nie bądź snobem!
__label__pl	Nie szukaj nas!
__label__pl	Chcemy więcej.
__label__pl	Chcę tego.
__label__pl	Tom nakarmił świnie.
__label__pl	To jest skórzany pasek.
__label__pl	Ona jest w wannie.
__label__pl	Ma wiele książek historycznych.
__label__pl	Tom ma rower.
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie wracasz do domu?
__label__pl	Ta lalka mnie przeraża.
__label__pl	On siedzi w fotelu.
__label__pl	Był Tom zaskoczony?
__label__pl	Idę do piekarni.
__label__pl	To nie są pieniądze.
__label__pl	Dlaczego się przeprowadzamy?
__label__pl	Oni są dziećmi.
__label__pl	To jest mapa.
__label__pl	Na co oszczędzasz?
__label__pl	Pogoda była idealna.
__label__pl	Dlaczego jesteście sami?
__label__pl	Zbierają orzechy.
__label__pl	Nie jestem artystą.
__label__pl	Czy Tom poszedł?
__label__pl	Pod mostem było ciemno.
__label__pl	To jest dla Toma.
__label__pl	Tom jest tutaj.
__label__pl	Każdy potrzebuje przyjaciół.
__label__pl	Gorąco ci?
__label__pl	Porozmawiaj ze mną!
__label__pl	Podziwiam cię.
__label__pl	Tom mnie zaskoczył.
__label__pl	On jest w lodówce.
__label__pl	Wszyscy to wiedzieli.
__label__pl	Tom ją widział.
__label__pl	Tom czeka.
__label__pl	Ty nie jesteś Bogiem.
__label__pl	Tom jest bogaty.
__label__pl	Czy moje uszy są czerwone?
__label__pl	Czy to przypadek?
__label__pl	Co oni mówią?
__label__pl	Chcę pomóc moim rodzicom.
__label__pl	To nie tak jak myślisz.
__label__pl	Nie walczymy.
__label__pl	My nie walczymy.
__label__pl	Puść moją rękę!
__label__pl	Mogę wrócić?
__label__pl	Czy to lekarstwo jest też w kroplach?
__label__pl	Toma nie było w domu.
__label__pl	Rana jeszcze nie jest zagojona.
__label__pl	Szukamy mojej książki.
__label__pl	Kiedy mam cię odebrać?
__label__pl	Nie mam żadnych uprzedzeń.
__label__pl	Byliśmy zajęci.
__label__pl	On słucha muzyki.
__label__pl	Pan ma oczywiście rację.
__label__pl	Oni mają oczywiście rację.
__label__pl	Czyj to był plan?
__label__pl	Chwileczkę!
__label__pl	Chcę piwo.
__label__pl	Nie jesteś w dobrej formie.
__label__pl	Nie lubię Toma.
__label__pl	Źle to zrozumiałem.
__label__pl	Zrobiłem to?
__label__pl	Musisz walczyć!
__label__pl	Czy macie czas?
__label__pl	Ty prowadzisz.
__label__pl	Zaczekaj.
__label__pl	Nie mam czasu dla pana.
__label__pl	Nienawidzę szpitali.
__label__pl	Ta kawa jest pyszna.
__label__pl	Lubię gotować.
__label__pl	Muszę być operowany.
__label__pl	To jest dobrze.
__label__pl	To logiczne.
__label__pl	Nikt mnie nie potrzebuje.
__label__pl	Miłość jest nieśmiertelna.
__label__pl	Chcę więcej.
__label__pl	Dlaczego pan pyta?
__label__pl	Jest chłodno.
__label__pl	Są rozbieżności.
__label__pl	Wszyscy zauważyli.
__label__pl	Tom wyczuł niechęć.
__label__pl	Chcesz loda?
__label__pl	Był rozczarowany.
__label__pl	Chcę tańczyć.
__label__pl	Chcę zatańczyć.
__label__pl	To mi się podoba.
__label__pl	Nikogo nie spotkałem.
__label__pl	Tu pada śnieg.
__label__pl	Gotuj dla mnie.
__label__pl	Pijesz wino?
__label__pl	Czy on ma rację?
__label__pl	Idź beze mnie!
__label__pl	Tu jesteśmy!
__label__pl	To jest dziecinnie łatwe.
__label__pl	Masz problemy?
__label__pl	Czułem się zdradzony.
__label__pl	Dużo pracuję.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy ogrodnikami.
__label__pl	Czy ja cię krzywdzę?
__label__pl	Pozwólcie nam na przerwę.
__label__pl	Wezwij karetkę!
__label__pl	Koty łapią myszy.
__label__pl	On wykonał swoją pracę.
__label__pl	Czy mogę dostać poduszkę?
__label__pl	Chcę wiedzieć, co to jest.
__label__pl	Zapytam Toma, co on myśli.
__label__pl	Chciałem zatańczyć.
__label__pl	Zawsze wstaję o 6 godzinie.
__label__pl	Nie jem ryb.
__label__pl	Mamy się dobrze.
__label__pl	Bałam się zgubić w ciemności.
__label__pl	Oni nie rozumieją tego.
__label__pl	Pan tego nie rozumie.
__label__pl	Nic nie podpiszę.
__label__pl	Nie będę nic podpisywać.
__label__pl	Chciałby pan tutaj zjeść?
__label__pl	Wszystko jest normalne.
__label__pl	Nie zostaniesz rozstrzelany.
__label__pl	Jestem stolarzem.
__label__pl	Nie wiem, gdzie mieszkasz.
__label__pl	Każdy wtorek mam wolne.
__label__pl	Potrafię to.
__label__pl	Będziemy ten las wycinać.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy bezbronni.
__label__pl	Założę się, że masz rację.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy tylko dwie mile od miasta.
__label__pl	Czy to mój kubek?
__label__pl	Tom chciał pieniędzy.
__label__pl	Ten dom jest nowy.
__label__pl	Tom nas uratuje.
__label__pl	Tom opuszcza miasto.
__label__pl	Nie było cię tam.
__label__pl	Mam tajemnicę.
__label__pl	Dziękuję, że mnie pan uratował.
__label__pl	Ona szuka mojego samochodu.
__label__pl	Idę do ósmej klasy.
__label__pl	Oto moja karta.
__label__pl	Tom to poprawił.
__label__pl	Czy to obietnica?
__label__pl	To mi nie odpowiada.
__label__pl	To jest po drugiej stronie ulicy.
__label__pl	Jestem szczery.
__label__pl	Teraz to czuję.
__label__pl	Oni są na zewnątrz.
__label__pl	Mam problem.
__label__pl	Niech pan nie wstaje.
__label__pl	Tom zrobił wszystko.
__label__pl	Opowiedz mi historyjkę.
__label__pl	Będziemy zajęci.
__label__pl	Zostaw to tam.
__label__pl	Zrób telewizor głośniej.
__label__pl	Byłem zbyt nieśmiały.
__label__pl	Podnosi swoją stopę.
__label__pl	Znam cię jak samego siebie.
__label__pl	Czy jesteś zły?
__label__pl	Mamy długą podróż za nami.
__label__pl	Biorę to na poważnie.
__label__pl	Zabiłem myszy.
__label__pl	Potrzebujemy wody.
__label__pl	Co zaginęło?
__label__pl	Myśli pan, że to działa?
__label__pl	Czy macie mapę?
__label__pl	Uczę się francuskiego w domu.
__label__pl	Kto was znalazł?
__label__pl	Nie pójdę.
__label__pl	Szukacie nas?
__label__pl	Wyłączyć światło!
__label__pl	Oni nie byli zaproszeni.
__label__pl	Pan nie był zaproszony.
__label__pl	Śmierdzisz.
__label__pl	Jest pochmurny dzień.
__label__pl	To jest denerwujące.
__label__pl	Bez ciebie to nie to samo.
__label__pl	Wszyscy myślą tak samo.
__label__pl	Dlaczego to robimy?
__label__pl	Niech pan zostanie po prawej stronie.
__label__pl	Niech pan się umyje.
__label__pl	Tom się rozbiera.
__label__pl	Tęsknisz za Bostonem?
__label__pl	Zamknę drzwi.
__label__pl	Twój oddech śmierdzi.
__label__pl	Tom ukląkł.
__label__pl	Tom nas opuścił.
__label__pl	Jesteście najlepsi.
__label__pl	To małe kłamstewko.
__label__pl	On wygląda zdrowo.
__label__pl	Masz coś między zębami.
__label__pl	Mój dziadek je pomarańczę.
__label__pl	Tom mnie zna.
__label__pl	Lubię jeść ciasteczka.
__label__pl	Czuję zapach kawy.
__label__pl	Przynieś to swojej matce.
__label__pl	Zjedz coś.
__label__pl	Tom się ukrywa.
__label__pl	Jeszcze nie jest za późno.
__label__pl	Kupuję prezent.
__label__pl	Nie podchodź zbyt blisko ognia!
__label__pl	Poszło szybko!
__label__pl	Mam czas.
__label__pl	Prawdopodobnie zadziała.
__label__pl	Miejmy nadzieję, że zadziała.
__label__pl	Obudziłem się spragniony.
__label__pl	Czy Tom znowu wygrał?
__label__pl	Dostałeś moją paczkę?
__label__pl	Dostała paczkę.
__label__pl	Czy paczka jeszcze nie dotarła?
__label__pl	On przyniósł paczkę na pocztę.
__label__pl	Mam paczkę dla pana.
__label__pl	Maria nie wysłała jeszcze tej paczki.
__label__pl	Przyszła paczka dla ciebie.
__label__pl	Listonosz przyniósł dziś rano paczkę.
__label__pl	Jesteś bogaty?
__label__pl	Tom ma katar sienny.
__label__pl	Jeszcze nie śpię.
__label__pl	Jeszcze mi nie zapłaciłeś.
__label__pl	Nie chcę tego teraz.
__label__pl	Ten samochód jest szybki.
__label__pl	To było nieplanowane.
__label__pl	Zrób zdjęcie.
__label__pl	Czy ktoś może prowadzić?
__label__pl	Ta rzeka wpada do Renu.

__label__pl	Istnieją różne rodzaje kawy.
__label__pl	Tutaj masz swoją sałatkę.
__label__pl	Gdzie jest pies?
__label__pl	Potrzebuję prawdy.
__label__pl	Czy to nie słodkie?
__label__pl	Tom jest niewinny.
__label__pl	Piękno jest tylko powierzchowne.
__label__pl	Tom jest powściągliwy.
__label__pl	Pobrali się.
__label__pl	Mam dobrą wiadomość.
__label__pl	Czy naprawde tego potrzebujemy?
__label__pl	Bądź dobrym chłopcem i poczekaj tutaj!

__label__pl	Tomo i ja pomożemy Ci.
__label__pl	Z pewnością przybędę. lecz pewnie trochę później.
__label__pl	Proszę nie wstawać.
__label__pl	On jest bogaty, lecz nie szczęśliwy.
__label__pl	On nie znajdzie mnie.
__label__pl	Czy ja teraz mogę iść?
__label__pl	Czy chcesz adwokata?
__label__pl	Mój kot lubi krewetki.
__label__pl	Kiedy ostatni raz jadłeś krewetki?
__label__pl	Słyszałam że Tom jest bardzo dobry w pływaniu.
__label__pl	Jest prawie ciemno.
__label__pl	Tom nic nie widział.
__label__pl	Czy chrapałem?
__label__pl	To my jesteśmy temu winni.
__label__pl	Tom też może przyjść.
__label__pl	„Nie otwierają”. - „Zadzwoń jeszcze raz!”
__label__pl	Wszyscy przeżyli.
__label__pl	Mam długopis.
__label__pl	Jest bardzo głośno.
__label__pl	Chcę go zaskoczyć.
__label__pl	Niech pan nie biegnie tak szybko!
__label__pl	Od jutra możemy razem chodzić do pracy.
__label__pl	Tom mnie uwielbia.
__label__pl	Piszecie listy miłosne?
__label__pl	Możemy wygrać.
__label__pl	Dlaczego mówisz mi to teraz?
__label__pl	On jest moim starym przyjacielem.
__label__pl	Tom napisał do mnie.
__label__pl	Krzyczałem o pomoc.
__label__pl	Kto was uczy francuskiego?
__label__pl	Jadę metrem.
__label__pl	Tom chciał to mieć.
__label__pl	Podnoszę stopę.
__label__pl	Nie to mam na myśli.
__label__pl	Tego się domyślałem.
__label__pl	Tom często pomaga Mary.
__label__pl	Nie mam żadnych kotów.
__label__pl	Jest łatwiejsza metoda.
__label__pl	Nigdy wcześniej nie jadłem mango.
__label__pl	Odrzucasz to?

__label__pl	Tom jest nieprzytomny.
__label__pl	Tym razem nie dam rady.
__label__pl	Jesz dużo?
__label__pl	Zawdzięczam ci życie.
__label__pl	Byłem zajęty.
__label__pl	Nie jesteśmy wrogami.
__label__pl	Nie jestem przestępcą.
__label__pl	Nie zazdroszczę ci.
__label__pl	Czy wszystko jest jasne?
__label__pl	On jest złym kierowcą.
__label__pl	Wsiedliśmy do samochodu.
__label__pl	Musimy się skoncentrować.
__label__pl	Muszę się pośpieszyć.
__label__pl	Te dzieci się boją.
__label__pl	Tom nie był głupi.
__label__pl	Tu jest twoja torba.
__label__pl	Pomogę Tomowi.
__label__pl	Mam trzysta dolarów.
__label__pl	Masło jest miękkie.
__label__pl	Jest jeszcze czas.
__label__pl	Tu jestem.
__label__pl	Był bardzo biedny.
__label__pl	Wstanę, po mieście chodzić będę, wśród ulic i placów, szukać będę ukochanego mej duszy.
__label__pl	Tom nic nie wziął.
__label__pl	Tom nic nie zabrał.
__label__pl	Tom czekał spokojnie.
__label__pl	Co dostaniesz?
__label__pl	Muszę to dostać.
__label__pl	Lubię spędzać z nią czas
__label__pl	Wolę sok ananasowy niż grejfrutowy
__label__pl	Jedz owoce!
__label__pl	On sprzedaje owoce.
__label__pl	Ona sprzedaje owoce.

__label__pl	Zbudź się!
__label__pl	Ten stół jest z drewna.
__label__pl	Nie chcę czekać.
__label__pl	Byłem zdezorientowany.
__label__pl	Musiałem się ukryć.
__label__pl	O kim myśleliście?
__label__pl	Czyja to pizza?
__label__pl	Mamy uprzedzenia.
__label__pl	Skręciłem kostkę.

__label__pl	Jestem smutna.
__label__pl	Zostawiam to tobie.
__label__pl	Jeszcze raz?
__label__pl	Podnieś.
__label__pl	Zrezygnowałem.
__label__pl	Przestałem.

__label__pl	Temperatura jest w nomie.
__label__pl	Moja temperatura jest w normie.
__label__pl	Biega.
__label__pl	Kocham go!
__label__pl	To nie jest krewetka.
__label__pl	Ta krewetka wygląda dziwnie.
__label__pl	Czy to aby na pewno jest krewetka?
__label__pl	Malutka krewetka chodziła po dnie akwarium.
__label__pl	A czy ta krewetka jest jadalna?
__label__pl	Nie sądzę, żeby to była krewetka.
__label__pl	Które z tych czasopism byś wolała?

__label__pl	Stój nieruchomo!
__label__pl	Widziałam go.
__label__pl	To tyle.
__label__pl	Czy ci nie zimno?
__label__pl	Czy to nie dziwne?
__label__pl	Nie wyglądam dziwnie?
__label__pl	Okropna pogoda!
__label__pl	Paskudna pogoda!
__label__pl	Co jadłaś?
__label__pl	Co jedliście?
__label__pl	Pada?
__label__pl	Tom, ty sknero!

__label__pl	Zaczerwieniłaś się.
__label__pl	Jesteś czerwona.
__label__pl	Masz rumieńce.
__label__pl	Jestem niewinny!
__label__pl	To żart?
__label__pl	To intuicja.
__label__pl	To takie dziwne!
__label__pl	To bardzo dziwne!
__label__pl	Bułka z masłem.
__label__pl	Miłość jest szalona.
__label__pl	To trudne.
__label__pl	Patrz na to!
__label__pl	Spójrz na to!
__label__pl	Popatrz na to!
__label__pl	Przyjrzyj się uważnie.
__label__pl	Martwię się.
__label__pl	Było ciemno.
__label__pl	Co kupiliście?
__label__pl	Podoba mi się.
__label__pl	Ten mi się podoba.
__label__pl	Gdzie kuchnia?
__label__pl	To było niebezpieczne!
__label__pl	Mało brakowało!
__label__pl	Bądź punktualny!
__label__pl	Masz pięć dolców?
__label__pl	Nie widać końca.
__label__pl	To nie ma końca.
__label__pl	Co odpowiedziałaś?
__label__pl	To dobry pomysł!
__label__pl	Dzwoń na policję!
__label__pl	Zdecydowałem.
__label__pl	Powiedział, że nie jest przyzwyczajony do wystąpień publicznych.
__label__pl	Policja nigdy nas nie znajdzie.
__label__pl	Tom zajmuje się tym problemem.
__label__pl	Tom przygląda się temu problemowi.
__label__pl	Tom rozpatruje ten problem.
__label__pl	To szkodzi interesom.
__label__pl	Zrobiłem wszystko, co musiałem zrobić.
__label__pl	Teraz wszyscy dobrze się bawią.
__label__pl	Tom może mieć wszystko, czego chce.
__label__pl	Tom i ja szukamy kogoś, kto może to dla nas zrobić.
__label__pl	Wiem, że nie musiałem, ale i tak to zrobiłem.
__label__pl	Mężczyzna wyszedł z restauracji nie płacąc.
__label__pl	Mężczyzna wyszedł z restauracji bez płacenia.
__label__pl	Wazon rozpadł się na kawałki.
__label__pl	Każdy dzień jest darem.
__label__pl	Wracamy do miasta.
__label__pl	Tom nie chciał podejmować tak dużego ryzyka.
__label__pl	Tom nie chciał ryzykować aż tak bardzo.
__label__pl	Tak lubimy.
__label__pl	Tom jest miły, prawda?
__label__pl	Nie pozwól, by Tom cię wykorzystał.
__label__pl	Nie pozwól Tom'owi się wykorzystać.
__label__pl	Odrobinę się powściągnąłem.
__label__pl	Wiem, że Tom był tam kilka godzin temu.
__label__pl	Jeśli nie możesz kochać siebie, nikt inny nie będzie.
__label__pl	Jeśli nie potrafisz kochać siebie, nikt inny tego nie zrobi.
__label__pl	Tom wstał, a za nim wszyscy inni.
__label__pl	Tom i ja ukończyliśmy ten sam uniwersytet.
__label__pl	Tom i ja skończyliśmy tę samą uczelnię.
__label__pl	Wiem, że Tom mógłby ucierpieć, gdyby próbował to zrobić.
__label__pl	Wiem, że Tom mógłby zrobić sobie krzywdę, gdyby próbował to zrobić.
__label__pl	Chcę wiedzieć, kiedy to się stanie.
__label__pl	Wyniki eksperymentu nie były zgodne z naszymi oczekiwaniami.
__label__pl	Powinieneś był przygotować się do lekcji.
__label__pl	Umiarkowane ćwiczenia wieczorem pomagają zasnąć.
__label__pl	To niezupełnie popularna knajpa, to raczej speluna.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary siedzieli przed kominkiem.
__label__pl	Tom mówi, że już nigdy tego nie zrobi.
__label__pl	Tom twierdzi, że już nigdy tego nie zrobi.
__label__pl	Myślę, że wszyscy popełniliśmy błędy.
__label__pl	Przepraszam, że rozmawiam z tobą w ten sposób.
__label__pl	Jak długo zamierzasz u nas zostać?
__label__pl	Ile czasu z nami zostaniesz?
__label__pl	Tom będzie próbował powstrzymać Mary przed zrobieniem tego.
__label__pl	Tom spróbuje powstrzymać przed tym Mary.
__label__pl	Tom siedział u szczytu stołu.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że myślał, że znasz Mary.
__label__pl	Nie rozumiem, co mówi ten mężczyzna.
__label__pl	Nie słyszę, co mówi ten człowiek.
__label__pl	Rozwiązałem to.
__label__pl	Widziałeś, co Tom może zrobić.
__label__pl	Widziałaś, co Tom potrafi.
__label__pl	Widzieli państwo, do czego Tom jest zdolny.
__label__pl	Tom nadal myśli, że pracuję dla Mary.
__label__pl	Tom tu nie zostaje.
__label__pl	Tom się tu nie zatrzymał.
__label__pl	Obiecujesz, że nie powiesz Tomowi, że miałem wypadek?
__label__pl	Nie jestem pewien, czy Tom to zrobił.
__label__pl	Tom zrobił ze mnie durnia.
__label__pl	Tom sprawił, że wyszedłem na głupka.
__label__pl	Tom sprawił, że wyglądam głupio.
__label__pl	To było wspaniałe doświadczenie.
__label__pl	Martwimy się tym.
__label__pl	Niepokoi nas to.
__label__pl	Budzi w nas to obawę.
__label__pl	To było dla mnie trudne.
__label__pl	To nie było dla mnie łatwe.
__label__pl	Było mi ciężko.
__label__pl	Myślałem, że Tom nie lubi oglądać horrorów.
__label__pl	Tom myśli, że jest duża szansa, że ​​znajdzie Mary.
__label__pl	Tom mówi płynnie po francusku.
__label__pl	Nowy Jork jest dumny ze swoich muzeów.
__label__pl	Ku mojej uldze wrócił do domu w cały i zdrowy.
__label__pl	Ku mojej uldze wróciła bezpiecznie do domu.
__label__pl	Wątpię, czy Tom da radę to zrobić, chyba że ktoś mu pomoże.
__label__pl	Tom prawdopodobnie wyszedł.
__label__pl	Zapomniałem ci powiedzieć o której zaczyna się spotkanie.
__label__pl	Nie możesz zrobić wszystkich tych rzeczy naraz.
__label__pl	Nie możesz robić wszystkiego na raz.
__label__pl	Tom opuścił Australię trzy tygodnie temu.
__label__pl	Tom wyjechał z Australii trzy tygodnie temu.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział mi, że kupił dom w Bostonie.

__label__pl	Mój samochód został skradziony. Nie ma go tam, gdzie go zaparkowałem.
__label__pl	Ukradziono mi samochód. Nie ma go tam, gdzie zostawiłem.
__label__pl	Nie sądzę, że Tom jest osobą, z którą powinieneś rozmawiać.
__label__pl	Nie sądzę, żeby Tom był osobą, z którą powinieneś o tym rozmawiać.
__label__pl	Kolory są żywe.
__label__pl	Ma żywe kolory.
__label__pl	Chciałbym, żeby coś się stało.
__label__pl	Tom próbuje nawiązać nowe znajomości.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że myślał, że Mary była zaskoczona.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że myślał, że może będzie mógł to zrobić dzisiaj.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że myślał, że może pozwolą mu to zrobić dzisiaj.
__label__pl	Wiedziałem, że Tom będzie w stanie to zrobić.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział mi, że powinienem jechać do Australii.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział mi, że powinienem lecieć do Australii.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział mi, że myślał, że Mary jest mądra.
__label__pl	Pomóż mi z tą szafką na akta.
__label__pl	Dzieci uwielbiają bawić się na plaży.
__label__pl	Nie zapomnij o filtrze przeciwsłonecznym.
__label__pl	Nie zapomnij swego kremu z filtrem.
__label__pl	Policja ma jednego z porywaczy w areszcie.
__label__pl	Policja aresztowała jednego z porywaczy.
__label__pl	Tom był zaniepokojony tą implikacją.
__label__pl	Co sprawiło, że zdecydowałeś się zostać nauczycielem?
__label__pl	Chciałbym więcej grzybów.
__label__pl	Proszę dokładkę grzybów.
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie współpracujesz?
__label__pl	Przedstawienie było wspaniałe. Szkoła że go nie widziałeś.
__label__pl	Tom nie wie, kiedy Mary odwiedzi Australię.
__label__pl	Nie byłem zaskoczony, że nie musiałem robić tego samego, co ty.
__label__pl	Czy dobrze się odżywiasz?
__label__pl	Kiedy kupiłaś ten rower?
__label__pl	Kiedy kupiłes ten rower?
__label__pl	Do widzenia!

__label__pl	Nie szkodzi!
__label__pl	Nie przejmuj się!
__label__pl	Nic nie szkodzi!
__label__pl	Mniejsza o to!
__label__pl	Jeszcze tylko tego brakowało.
__label__pl	Do dna!
__label__pl	Wynocha.
__label__pl	Ogień parzy.

__label__pl	Bądź realistą.
__label__pl	W samą porę.
__label__pl	Niezłe wyczucie czasu.
__label__pl	Och proszę!
__label__pl	Proszę poczekać.
__label__pl	Chwileczkę.
__label__pl	Dzwoniłem.
__label__pl	Przestań się ruszać!
__label__pl	Poproszę herbatę.
__label__pl	Mary zachichotała.
__label__pl	Wypadki chodzą po ludziach.

__label__pl	Miej się na baczności.
__label__pl	Witamy z powrotem.
__label__pl	Próbuj dalej.

__label__pl	Wezwij ochronę!
__label__pl	Dzwoń po ochronę!
__label__pl	Zawołajcie ochronę!
__label__pl	Niech ktoś wezwie ochronę!
__label__pl	Nikt nie pytał.
__label__pl	Nikt cię nie pytał o zdanie.
__label__pl	Przyłącz się do nas.
__label__pl	Ty zdecyduj.
__label__pl	Witam ponownie.
__label__pl	Proszę to jeszcze przemyśleć.

__label__pl	Tom coś burknął.
__label__pl	Tom coś odburknął.
__label__pl	Nie udało mi się.

__label__pl	Poniosłem porażkę.
__label__pl	Poległam.
__label__pl	Proszę oddychać normalnie.
__label__pl	Niech pan oddycha normalnie.
__label__pl	Objawy są różne.
__label__pl	Jakie smaczne!
__label__pl	Przetrwałeś.
__label__pl	Przeżyłaś.
__label__pl	Przetrwaliście.
__label__pl	Przeżył pan.
__label__pl	Udało ci się przeżyć.
__label__pl	Obiecałeś.
__label__pl	Zaczekaj na zewnątrz.
__label__pl	Oszukiwałeś.
__label__pl	Ściągałeś.

__label__pl	Odczep się.
__label__pl	Odwal się.
__label__pl	Zjeżdżaj.
__label__pl	Ty obłudniku!
__label__pl	Ty hipokryto!
__label__pl	Ty hipokrytko!
__label__pl	Rozchmurz się.
__label__pl	Głowa do góry.
__label__pl	Rozchmurzcie się.
__label__pl	Odpuść sobie!
__label__pl	Zwolnij!
__label__pl	Wolniej!
__label__pl	Proszę zwolnić!
__label__pl	Przystopuj trochę!
__label__pl	Nie śpiesz się tak!
__label__pl	Złap się czegoś.
__label__pl	Szykuj się.
__label__pl	Proszę się przygotować.
__label__pl	Odrzucenie boli.
__label__pl	Odrzucenie rani.
__label__pl	Odmowa boli.
__label__pl	Próbował.
__label__pl	Proszę iść.
__label__pl	Proszę, idź.
__label__pl	Niech pan idzie.
__label__pl	Posłuchajcie.
__label__pl	Proszę posłuchać.
__label__pl	Niech pani posłucha.
__label__pl	Posłuchaj.
__label__pl	Słuchaj uważnie.
__label__pl	Twój ojciec nic nie wie.
__label__pl	Twój ojciec o niczym nie wie.
__label__pl	Twój ojciec się nie zna.
__label__pl	Myślisz że jaką pracę dostaniesz z tym dyplomem?
__label__pl	Wyrzucę cię ze szkoły.
__label__pl	Wykopię cię z tej szkoły.
__label__pl	Dam ci znać, jeśli wydarzy się coś dziwnego.
__label__pl	Tom został zmuszony do przejścia na emeryturę.
__label__pl	Tom był zmuszony przejść na emeryturę.
__label__pl	Budowa rozpoczęła się 20 października 2013 roku.
__label__pl	Tom wrzucił do kawy sól zamiast cukru.
__label__pl	Drzwi po lewej się otworzą.
__label__pl	Nigdy więcej nie pozwól, aby to się powtórzyło.
__label__pl	Nie pozwól, żeby to się znowu stało.
__label__pl	Nie pozwól, żeby znowu do tego doszło.
__label__pl	I niech mi się to więcej nie powtórzy.
__label__pl	Niech to się więcej nie powtórzy.
__label__pl	Żeby się to więcej nie powtórzyło.
__label__pl	Będziemy to robić tak samo, jak zawsze.
__label__pl	Zrobimy wszystko jak zwykle.
__label__pl	Wszystko będziemy robić jak zwykle.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary imprezują.
__label__pl	Możesz znaleźć to, czego szukasz w jednej z tych książek.
__label__pl	Uważaj, tam jest łabędź!
__label__pl	Świeco, zgaśnij.
__label__pl	Nie jest ci dobrze w aksamicie.
__label__pl	Lepiej by ci było aksamicie.
__label__pl	Po co mi mówisz o jakimś aksamicie?
__label__pl	W niedzielę pojechaliśmy na pchli targ.
__label__pl	Nad nami latała jaskółka.
__label__pl	Na początku myślałam, że to była jaskółka, ale się myliłam.
__label__pl	To mogła być jaskółka.
__label__pl	W gnieździe była tylko jedna jaskółka.
__label__pl	Ile piskląt ma przeciętna jaskółka?
__label__pl	Chyba właśnie ugryzła mnie pchła.
__label__pl	Pchła cię ugryzła, czy co?!
__label__pl	Co więcej, nie zawsze można być pewnym, że to pchła cię ugryzła.
__label__pl	Jakie typy aksamitu dostępne są na rynku?
__label__pl	Jakie kolory aksamitu są na topie?
__label__pl	Kupiłam sobie żakiet z aksamitu.
__label__pl	Czy aksamit, welwet, plusz i welur to ta sama tkanina?
__label__pl	Dzięki aksamitowi możemy stworzyć przytulne, komfortowe i ładne wnętrze.
__label__pl	Dokładnie przyjrzała się aksamitowi, który wyściełał wnętrze gabloty.
__label__pl	Daj szansę aksamitowi.
__label__pl	Korzystne dla figury drapowanie w talii nadają lśniącemu aksamitowi nowego blasku.
__label__pl	Sposób tkania nadaje aksamitowi charakterystyczną delikatność.
__label__pl	Cieliste sandałki na szpilce idealnie dodały lekkości ciężkiemu aksamitowi sukienki.
__label__pl	Takie srebrne guziki nie tylko przyciągają wzrok, ale pozwalają aksamitowi pięknie się układać.
__label__pl	Jeśli już mówimy o wyjątkowych tkaninach, poświęćmy chwili uwagi aksamitowi.
__label__pl	Suknia wyglądała naprawdę widowiskowo dzięki aksamitowi, z którego ją wykonano.
__label__pl	Czym gołąb dziki różni się od hodowlanego?
__label__pl	Weszła do sklepu z zegarkami.
__label__pl	Okazuje się, że dane przesyłane między telefonami a zegarkami można wykraść.
__label__pl	Postrzelony orzeł bielik został znaleziony na obrzeżach lasu.
__label__pl	Co wypadło, orzeł czy reszka?
__label__pl	Jeśli wypadnie orzeł - wygrywam ja, jeśli reszka - wygrywa mój przeciwnik.
__label__pl	Był u nas wczoraj szwagier.
__label__pl	Szwagier to brat małżonka lub mąż siostry.
__label__pl	Oboje wylądowali w szpitalu, podobnie jak ich szwagier i dziecko.
__label__pl	Zerwał mi się pasek w zegarku.
__label__pl	Zerwał mi się pasek od zegarka.
__label__pl	Jak zmienić datę w zegarku?
__label__pl	Jak działa chronograf w zegarku?
__label__pl	Zakład oferuje wymianę pasków w zegarku.
__label__pl	Podaj mi, proszę, jedno z tych czasopism.
__label__pl	Masz tu listę najpopularniejszych czasopism.
__label__pl	Zajmuje trzecie miejsce w rankingu najpopularniejszych czasopism naukowych.
__label__pl	Na ostatniej stronie znajdował się wykaz czasopism.
__label__pl	Nasza oferta czasopism jest bardzo bogata.
__label__pl	Ochrona zdrowia to w tym roku wyjątkowo ważka sprawa.
__label__pl	Bo też to jest wyjątkowo ważka sprawa.
__label__pl	Tak ważka sprawa zaintrygowała nawet samego przewodniczącego.
__label__pl	Ważka lata nad kałużą.
__label__pl	Założył krawat zamiast muchy.
__label__pl	Padali jak muchy.
__label__pl	A ty jak zwykle robisz z muchy słonia.
__label__pl	Mowa oczywiście o zegarkach i spinkach do mankietów.
__label__pl	To portal o zegarkach.
__label__pl	A co jest takiego niezwykłego w tych zegarkach?
__label__pl	Mimo to wolałabym, żeby ta fotografia była kolorowa.
__label__pl	Popatrz, jaka kolorowa książeczka!
__label__pl	Przydałaby mi się kolorowa laserowa drukarka.
__label__pl	Jaskółka była uwięziona w klatce.
__label__pl	Na tym rysunku jest jaskółka.
__label__pl	A to jerzyk czy jaskółka?
__label__pl	Powtarzasz tylko jak papuga!
__label__pl	W ogóle nie masz własnego zdania!
__label__pl	Do tego zwierzę domowe, nie ważne czy to papuga, kot, pies czy świnka morska, wyrabia u dziecka poczucie odpowiedzialności.
__label__pl	W środku była martwa papuga.
__label__pl	Wynająłeś już papugę?
__label__pl	Wynająłeś już adwokata?
__label__pl	Tom to podły gad, nienawidzę go!
__label__pl	Gad po prostu zniknął.
__label__pl	Być może wkrótce się dowiemy jaki to był gad.
__label__pl	Który gad żyje najdłużej?
__label__pl	Pacjent ukąszony w palec nawet złapał żmiję i w słoiku przywiózł na oddział, żeby pokazać, jaki gad go zaatakował.
__label__pl	Gad podpełznął bliżej.
__label__pl	Żałuję, że nie pojawiłaś się w moim życiu wcześniej.
__label__pl	Tom był w szoku.
__label__pl	Tom i ja nie mieszkamy w tym samym stanie.
__label__pl	Tom jest z mojego rodzinnego stanu Iowa.
__label__pl	Tom został skazany na trzy lata w więzieniu stanowym.
__label__pl	Wyszliśmy na boisko i graliśmy tak dobrze, jak tylko mogliśmy.
__label__pl	Tom przemknął przez pole.
__label__pl	Tom przebiegł przez boisko.
__label__pl	Tom został zniesiony z boiska na noszach.
__label__pl	Tom jest pionierem w tej dziedzinie.
__label__pl	Pole zostało już zasiane.
__label__pl	Tom jest wiodącym ekspertem w swojej dziedzinie.
__label__pl	Filozofia jest interesującym kierunkiem studiów.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary rozbili obóz na polu.
__label__pl	Ciało Toma znaleziono w otwartym polu.
__label__pl	Tom jest ekspertem w swojej dziedzinie.
__label__pl	Klasa Toma wybrała się na wycieczkę w zeszły poniedziałek.
__label__pl	Nasza klasa wybiera się na wycieczkę w przyszły poniedziałek.
__label__pl	Tom nigdy nie grał na pozycji środkowego.
__label__pl	To pole nigdy nie zostało zaorane.
__label__pl	Jesteś ekspertem w tej dziedzinie.
__label__pl	Tom jest ekspertem w tej dziedzinie.
__label__pl	Tom jest autorytetem w swojej dziedzinie.
__label__pl	Pobiegłem przez pole.
__label__pl	Tom pobiegł przez pole.
__label__pl	Mamy nadzieję zakończyć obsadzanie pola przed zachodem słońca.
__label__pl	Samolot kołował przez pole do hangaru.
__label__pl	Tom odbył specjalne szkolenie w tej dziedzinie.
__label__pl	Tom miał z tego specjalne szkolenie.
__label__pl	Jakie masz doświadczenie praktyczne?
__label__pl	Jakie masz doświadczenie w terenie?
__label__pl	Jakie masz doświadczenie operacyjne?
__label__pl	Tom zaorał całe pole w trzy godziny.
__label__pl	Jutro odpocznę.
__label__pl	Teraz odpoczywam.
__label__pl	Powiedz Tomowi, że powinien odpocząć.
__label__pl	Najpierw muszę się tu zaaklimatyzować.
__label__pl	Najpierw muszę się tutaj rozejrzeć.
__label__pl	Czy drzwi są otwarte?
__label__pl	Jakich potraw unikasz?
__label__pl	Jakich dań unikasz?
__label__pl	To jest do uniknięcia.
__label__pl	Powinniśmy unikać paniki.
__label__pl	Z drogi!
__label__pl	Gdzie leziesz!
__label__pl	No mów!
__label__pl	Źle!
__label__pl	Pasuje ci?
__label__pl	Czy to odpowiedni moment?
__label__pl	Jaka szkoda.
__label__pl	Prawie się udało.
__label__pl	Znalazłam!
__label__pl	Jestem zaniepokojona.
__label__pl	Niepokoi mnie to.
__label__pl	Pa pa!
__label__pl	Zmęczony?
__label__pl	To moja wina?
__label__pl	To przeze mnie?
__label__pl	Czy to mój błąd?
__label__pl	Ja jestem za to odpowiedzialny?
__label__pl	To kwiatek?
__label__pl	To są kwiaty?
__label__pl	Zrobiłeś rezerwację?
__label__pl	Tanio, nie?
__label__pl	To jest tanie.
__label__pl	Ale tanie.
__label__pl	Będziesz mógł przyjść?
__label__pl	Bitwa na śnieżki!
__label__pl	Jesteś gliną?
__label__pl	Jesteś z policji?
__label__pl	Jesteś policjantem?
__label__pl	Są tacy młodzi.
__label__pl	Jesteś taki młody.
__label__pl	Jestem teraz wolna.
__label__pl	Robisz coś dziś wieczorem?
__label__pl	Coś robisz wieczorem?
__label__pl	Jesteś wieczorem zajęty?
__label__pl	Jestem singlem.
__label__pl	Ma 12 lat.
__label__pl	Obrzydlistwo!
__label__pl	To wstrętne!
__label__pl	Czas minął.
__label__pl	Jesteś niedobrym człowiekiem!
__label__pl	Nie strzelaj!
__label__pl	Zmień ubranie.
__label__pl	Przebierz się.
__label__pl	Ale zimno.
__label__pl	Jestem w paskudnym nastroju!
__label__pl	Czuję się paskudnie!
__label__pl	Czuję się świetnie!
__label__pl	Jestem w świetnej formie!
__label__pl	U mnie w porządku.
__label__pl	Zrozumiano.
__label__pl	Pozwę cię!
__label__pl	Podam cię do sądu!
__label__pl	Założę ci sprawę!
__label__pl	Drewno pływa.
__label__pl	Drzewa unoszą się na wodzie.
__label__pl	Nie żartuj.
__label__pl	Nie wygłupiaj się.
__label__pl	Za wszelką cenę!
__label__pl	Nie słyszę was.
__label__pl	To jest nasz pociąg.
__label__pl	To jest moje rodzeństwo.
__label__pl	Dziękuję, że tu przyszedłeś.
__label__pl	Co jestem wam winien?
__label__pl	Na razie nie potrzebujemy niczego.
__label__pl	Mam tymczasowe prawo jazdy.
__label__pl	Zegar spóźnia się dziesięć minut.
__label__pl	Jestem strasznie głodny.
__label__pl	Pójdę sam.
__label__pl	Wszyscy są zajęci.
__label__pl	Szukam mojego ołówka.
__label__pl	Przyniosłem wam trochę gorącej zupy.
__label__pl	Zrobię to od razu.
__label__pl	Każdy zasługuje na drugą szansę.
__label__pl	Dużo pływam.
__label__pl	Czy masz coś do jedzenia?
__label__pl	Kto przygotuje jedzenie?
__label__pl	Jestem najmłodszym dzieckiem.
__label__pl	Jak można się było spodziewać, rozumiesz.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy dobrymi rodzicami.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy złymi rodzicami?
__label__pl	Czy jesteśmy złymi rodzicami?
__label__pl	Nie możemy wybrać naszych rodziców.
__label__pl	Ten płaszcz jest ciepły.
__label__pl	Czytasz książkę.
__label__pl	Teraz przestań płakać.
__label__pl	To sprawiłoby mi przyjemność.
__label__pl	Na środku pajęczyny siedział pająk.
__label__pl	Pająk był czarny, włochaty i ogromny.
__label__pl	Pająk, którego znalazła w łazience, okazał się jadowity.
__label__pl	Z sufitu zwisał duży, sztuczny włochaty pająk z czerwonymi oczami.
__label__pl	Ile oczu ma pająk?
__label__pl	Nie wolno wnosić napojów i jedzenia.
__label__pl	Zaległe opłaty należy wnosić na poniższy rachunek.
__label__pl	W tym miesiącu niektórzy przedsiębiorcy nie będą musieli wnosić opłat za czynsz.
__label__pl	Z jego wypowiedzi można by nawet wnosić, że rozważają wycofanie się z wyborów.
__label__pl	Zostawmy to tu, nie chce mi się tego wnosić.
__label__pl	Jesteś za szczupły.
__label__pl	Szczupły nie zawsze znaczy zdrowy.
__label__pl	Chcesz być szczupły?
__label__pl	Nie chcę być szczupły, chcę być szczęśliwy.
__label__pl	Mężczyzna był szczupły i ponadprzeciętnie wysoki.
__label__pl	Ma sto siedemdziesiąt pięć centymetrów wzrostu, jest szczupły, ma siwe włosy, szare oczy i krótką, ciemną brodę.
__label__pl	Kogut zapiał.
__label__pl	Czy kogut jest potrzebny, aby kura znosiła jajka?
__label__pl	Kogut to samiec kury.
__label__pl	Kogut dziobnął ją w lewą nogę, co skończyło się zakażeniem.
__label__pl	Kiedy byłem dzieckiem podziobał mnie kogut.
__label__pl	Wleczesz się jak żółw.
__label__pl	Szczęście zbliża się powoli jak żółw, a ucieka jak sarna.

__label__pl	Wiem, że Tom nie powiedziałby Mary.
__label__pl	Nie mogła powstrzymać płaczu.
__label__pl	Nie mogła powstrzymać się od płaczu.
__label__pl	Tom został aresztowany w poniedziałek rano.
__label__pl	Tom kupił najtańszą rzecz w sklepie.
__label__pl	Nie muszę odpowiadać na to pytanie.
__label__pl	Nie muszę odpowiadać na twoje pytanie.
__label__pl	Kto jeszcze czekał na Toma?
__label__pl	Dzisiaj pewnie nie pójdę do szkoły piechotą.
__label__pl	Dziś prawdopodobnie nie pójdę do szkoły na piechotę.
__label__pl	Postaraj się nie zmoknąć.
__label__pl	Nie mogę mówić za wszystkich moich kolegów.
__label__pl	Przyszedłem wczoraj.
__label__pl	Ona się boi.
__label__pl	On kupuje walizkę.
__label__pl	Jest w lodówce.
__label__pl	Byłbym ostrożny.
__label__pl	Smakuje mi twoja kawa.
__label__pl	To mięso jest dobre.
__label__pl	Zapytaj policjanta!
__label__pl	Czekałem godzinę.
__label__pl	Tam na stole stoi butelka wina.
__label__pl	Po kolacji umyłem talerze.
__label__pl	Czy chcesz to wziąć?
__label__pl	Chcesz to zabrać?
__label__pl	Obudziliśmy was?
__label__pl	Pracuję na poczcie.

__label__pl	Została ranna w wypadku drogowym.
__label__pl	Tom jest singlem.
__label__pl	Mam pokrzywkę.
__label__pl	Jestem uczennicą.
__label__pl	Obawiam się, że nie.
__label__pl	Uprawiam sport.
__label__pl	Ten hałas przeszkadza.
__label__pl	Lubię krótkie fryzury.
__label__pl	On się rozłączył.
__label__pl	Rozłączył się.
__label__pl	Jesteś niesamowity!
__label__pl	Tom jest kawalerem.
__label__pl	Tom został zastrzelony.
__label__pl	Robi się późno.
__label__pl	Jane została niesprawiedliwie zwolniona ze swojego stanowiska.
__label__pl	Słuchaj swojej matki.
__label__pl	Kiedy pójdziecie?
__label__pl	Mogą mieć tę książkę.
__label__pl	Na ile nocy?
__label__pl	Chodź ze mną pływać.
__label__pl	Zignoruj je.
__label__pl	Zignoruj ją.
__label__pl	Jest wystarczająco jedzenia dla was wszystkich.
__label__pl	Ta mysz się poruszyła.
__label__pl	Mam duży nos.
__label__pl	Tom będzie miał koszmary.
__label__pl	Bolały mnie stopy.
__label__pl	Masz jakiś plan?
__label__pl	Morze będzie coraz kwaśniejsze.
__label__pl	Zgubiła się.
__label__pl	Jestem chory od poniedziałku.
__label__pl	Jest jeszcze ciemno.
__label__pl	Nic nie zapłaciłem.
__label__pl	Jak smakuje to jabłko?
__label__pl	Czy to nasz hotel?
__label__pl	Pracujemy nad tym.
__label__pl	Nadal jestem w szoku.
__label__pl	Ta czarna mysz jest duża.
__label__pl	Czy to dużo?
__label__pl	Wyjrzyj przez okno!
__label__pl	Chcę ci pomóc.
__label__pl	Pozwól Tomowi to zrobić.
__label__pl	Kto do tego dopuścił?
__label__pl	Daj ją jej.
__label__pl	Nie zacząłeś beze mnie, prawda?
__label__pl	Emo noszą czarną szminkę.
__label__pl	Czy wiesz o kim mówię?
__label__pl	To jest to czego chciałeś, prawda?
__label__pl	Oni nie chcieli dalszego rozwoju niewolnictwa.
__label__pl	Biblioteka jest na górze.
__label__pl	Całkowicie zgadzam się z wami obojgiem.
__label__pl	Muzułmańskie kobiety ubierają się konserwatywnie.
__label__pl	Powiedziałbym to samo.
__label__pl	Nie śpię dużo.
__label__pl	Oni jedzą chleb.
__label__pl	Zawdzięczam ci tak wiele.
__label__pl	Tom jest stolarzem.
__label__pl	Chciałbym cię pocałować.
__label__pl	Mam dużo szczęścia.
__label__pl	Daj je Tomowi.
__label__pl	Nie jest dobrze.
__label__pl	Kto to zamówił?
__label__pl	Nie przeklinaj!
__label__pl	Nie widzę zbyt dobrze.
__label__pl	Kto pływał?
__label__pl	Czy Tom wiedział?
__label__pl	Ciastko jest zjedzone.
__label__pl	Podarła list na kawałki.
__label__pl	Nienawidzę mojej pracy.
__label__pl	Będziemy posłuszni.
__label__pl	Strzelił do mnie.
__label__pl	Oni jadą windą.
__label__pl	Upiekłam ciasteczka.
__label__pl	Oni są grzeczni.
__label__pl	Bardzo dobrze grasz na gitarze.
__label__pl	To jest twoje.
__label__pl	Dziś pada deszcz.
__label__pl	Ten rower należy do mojego brata.
__label__pl	Tylko pytam.
__label__pl	Mam przerwę.
__label__pl	To trochę desperackie.
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie chcesz tego robić?
__label__pl	Tom robi to bardzo rzadko.
__label__pl	Nie musisz się przejmować tym co powiedział Tom.
__label__pl	Kto tu miaszka?
__label__pl	Kto tutaj mieszka?
__label__pl	Jestem tego całkiem pewien.
__label__pl	Niech pan weźmie aspirynę.
__label__pl	Znajdźcie sobie pracę.
__label__pl	Tu jest mój kwit.
__label__pl	Zapytam go.
__label__pl	Tom tam mieszkał.
__label__pl	Nie jestem drobiazgowy.
__label__pl	Mój ojciec zostawił mi wielką fortunę.
__label__pl	Tom posadził marchewki.
__label__pl	Lubię twój kapelusz.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy dziennikarzami.
__label__pl	Za moim domem jest mały staw.
__label__pl	Wybacz nam.
__label__pl	Nie nienawidzę pana.
__label__pl	Pan nie może przegrać.
__label__pl	Oni nie mogą przegrać.
__label__pl	Mam dużo pieniędzy do dyspozycji.
__label__pl	Chętnie wędkuję.
__label__pl	Jestem w niebezpieczeństwie.
__label__pl	Nie masz gustu.
__label__pl	Jest tego więcej.
__label__pl	Właściwie dlaczego mnie to obchodzi?
__label__pl	To jest nieodpowiednie.
__label__pl	Proszę, bądź szczery!
__label__pl	Gratuluję panu!
__label__pl	Słyszałeś to?
__label__pl	Nie jestem szczęśliwy.
__label__pl	Proszę chwilę poczekać.
__label__pl	Kochamy nasze parki.
__label__pl	Tom jest bardzo naiwny.
__label__pl	Tom ją znał.
__label__pl	Też tego chcę.
__label__pl	Znowu wygrałem.
__label__pl	Co dzisiaj robicie.
__label__pl	Oni wiedzą wystarczająco.
__label__pl	Mam kilka ołówków.
__label__pl	Pokaż je Tomowi!
__label__pl	Jedzenie było bardzo dobre.
__label__pl	To jest w porządku.
__label__pl	Był sam.
__label__pl	To jest moje biuro.
__label__pl	Potrafię jeździć na nartach.
__label__pl	Przyszliśmy pieszo.
__label__pl	On działa szybko.
__label__pl	Czyj to sweter?
__label__pl	Tom idzie sam.
__label__pl	Kłóciliśmy się.
__label__pl	Nie mogę nikomu wierzyć.
__label__pl	Pomóżmy Tomowi!
__label__pl	Podoba mi się ta filiżanka.
__label__pl	Nudzisz się tutaj?
__label__pl	Jestem szalona.
__label__pl	Jestem szalony.
__label__pl	Ja też nie umiem tańczyć.
__label__pl	Czy to twoje piwo?
__label__pl	Wyjdź z mojego pokoju!
__label__pl	W parku jest wiele zwierząt.
__label__pl	Jemy ryż.
__label__pl	Czy to ma sens?
__label__pl	Nie poznałem jeszcze rodziny Toma.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy przyjaciółkami.
__label__pl	Lepiej się do tego przyzwyczajaj.
__label__pl	On kocha muzykę.
__label__pl	Jestem krótkowidzem.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy właścicielami.
__label__pl	On przyciął wiśniowe drzewo.
__label__pl	Jestem tylko rolnikiem.
__label__pl	Przyjdę o dziesiątej.
__label__pl	Zjadłeś już obiad?
__label__pl	Czy pan nas słyszy?
__label__pl	Oni są rodzeństwem.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy bardzo zajęci.
__label__pl	Tom się ogolił.
__label__pl	Zdenerwowaliśmy Toma.
__label__pl	Czy jesteśmy w niebezpieczeństwie?
__label__pl	Spaliłem to.
__label__pl	Tom jest zwycięzcą.
__label__pl	Zagrajmy w pokera!
__label__pl	Czy pan wędkuje?
__label__pl	Czy łowi pan ryby?
__label__pl	Zrozumiałem to.
__label__pl	Dłoń ma pięć palców: kciuk, palec wskazujący, palec środkowy, palec serdeczny i mały palec.
__label__pl	Tom ma grzybicę stóp.
__label__pl	Ledwo mogę chodzić.
__label__pl	Tom jest zdezorientowany.
__label__pl	To jest moja teoria.
__label__pl	Przeżyjemy to.
__label__pl	Próbował uciec.
__label__pl	Drzwi stodoły były otwarte.
__label__pl	Nie jestem bardzo zajęty.
__label__pl	Zgubiliśmy się we mgle.
__label__pl	Wystrzelił z pozycji leżącej.
__label__pl	Idź, powiedz to.
__label__pl	Czy to skomplikowane?
__label__pl	Nie bądź durniem!
__label__pl	Zostaw to nam!
__label__pl	Poprosiłem cię przecież, żebyś tam nie szedł.
__label__pl	Sprowadź pomoc!
__label__pl	Biorę kąpiel.
__label__pl	Wezmę kąpiel.
__label__pl	Czy był pan z Tomem w Australii?
__label__pl	Gdzie oni mieszkają?
__label__pl	Wiem, dokąd oni idą.
__label__pl	Czy to broń?
__label__pl	Mój brat jest bardzo ważny. Przynajmniej tak myśli.
__label__pl	Nie dawaj mi tego!
__label__pl	To było całkiem zabawne.
__label__pl	Już się o to zatroszczyłem.
__label__pl	Tom się ożenił.
__label__pl	Tom bardzo się spóźnił.
__label__pl	Wszyscy kochamy Toma.
__label__pl	On idzie do domu.
__label__pl	Niech pan będzie bardzo ostrożny!
__label__pl	Czekałem.
__label__pl	Kiedy to zostało zbudowane?
__label__pl	Nie krzywdź jej!
__label__pl	Przyjdź wcześniej.
__label__pl	Pożegnaliśmy się.
__label__pl	To jest ostatnia gra.
__label__pl	Mam dziś dzień wolny od pracy.
__label__pl	Ile to jest warte?
__label__pl	Tom był prawnikiem.
__label__pl	Co sprzedaje Tom?
__label__pl	To sprawia, że wszystkie dzieci są szczęśliwe.
__label__pl	Kto umiera?
__label__pl	Tom ją znalazł.
__label__pl	Masz pytania?
__label__pl	Uczę się prowadzić samochód.
__label__pl	Tom spóźnił się na przyjęcie.
__label__pl	Nie jesteś sam.
__label__pl	Pójdę do domu i przyniosę to.
__label__pl	Umie pan dobrze tańczyć?
__label__pl	Nie pomyliliście się.
__label__pl	On na pewno wygra.
__label__pl	W ogóle mi się to nie podoba.
__label__pl	To musi być Tom.
__label__pl	Próbowałem krzyczeć.
__label__pl	Mamy wszystko.
__label__pl	Nie mogę zostać.
__label__pl	Chętnie pomożemy.
__label__pl	Zrobiłem to dobrowolnie.
__label__pl	Nie mów ani słowa.
__label__pl	Nie piję wina.
__label__pl	Tom jest reporterem.
__label__pl	Ona lubi pić kawę.
__label__pl	Wszystko zostało skradzione.
__label__pl	Mój brat nadal śpi.
__label__pl	Czy to jest legalne?
__label__pl	Też jestem szczęśliwy.
__label__pl	Czy to jest za duże?
__label__pl	Nasza Droga Mleczna to galaktyka.
__label__pl	Idę do apteki.
__label__pl	Jak długo zostaniesz w Australii?
__label__pl	Tom rozumie Marię.
__label__pl	Tom jest terrorystą.
__label__pl	To długa historia.
__label__pl	Weźcie aspirynę.
__label__pl	Czy mnie widzisz?
__label__pl	Dziękuję za zaufanie!
__label__pl	Jej ogród to dzieło sztuki.
__label__pl	Jakiej narodowości jesteś?
__label__pl	Przytoczę wam jeszcze jeden przykład.
__label__pl	Przytoczę panu jeszcze jeden przykład.
__label__pl	Przytoczę pani jeszcze jeden przykład.
__label__pl	Podam wam jeszcze jeden przykład.
__label__pl	Podam panu jeszcze jeden przykład.
__label__pl	Podam pani jeszcze jeden przykład.
__label__pl	Masz coś dla mnie?
__label__pl	Mam inny pomysł.
__label__pl	Mam nadzieję, że wszyscy wiedzą, co to znaczy.
__label__pl	Nie chciałem rozczarować swoich rodziców.
__label__pl	Powiedz mi, kiedy się urodziłeś.
__label__pl	To moje ostatnie ostrzeżenie!
__label__pl	On jest zdrajcą.
__label__pl	Tom czyta tylko beletrystykę.
__label__pl	Sydney to największe miasto w Australii.
__label__pl	Nie mam teraz pod ręką słownika.
__label__pl	Nie miałem pojęcia, że należysz do tego klubu.
__label__pl	Ta herbata jest zbyt słodka.
__label__pl	Na stole leżało dużo pieniędzy.
__label__pl	Wrócę za pół godziny.
__label__pl	Oni mówią po francusku.
__label__pl	One mówią po francusku.
__label__pl	Tak, byłem tam dwa albo trzy razy.
__label__pl	On zawsze się spóźniał.
__label__pl	Tom nienawidzi tkwić w korku.
__label__pl	Tom nie różni się od innych.
__label__pl	Mam dużo starych książek. Niektóre z nich są dosyć cenne.
__label__pl	Potrzebuję więcej przykładów, żeby zrozumieć, jak słowo jest używane.
__label__pl	Co się ze mną stało?
__label__pl	Tom utknął w korku.
__label__pl	Próbuję ją ochronić.
__label__pl	Tu nie ma sprzeczności.
__label__pl	Obie wiemy, co trzeba zrobić.
__label__pl	Na herbie obwodu czelabińskiego widnieje wielbłąd.
__label__pl	Na herbie obwodu czelabińskiego przedstawiony jest wielbłąd.
__label__pl	On nie ma zdolności matematycznych.
__label__pl	Tom prawie nigdy się nie śmieje.
__label__pl	Tom nie może się doczekać, aby wziąć się do pracy.
__label__pl	Wyprzedź ten czerwony samochód.
__label__pl	Kiedy wasz dom będzie gotowy, żeby się do niego wprowadzić?
__label__pl	Wiem, że jesteś nauczycielką.
__label__pl	O której godzinie odjeżdża pociąg?
__label__pl	Diamenty są dosyć twarde.
__label__pl	Powieść kończy się śmiercią bohaterki.
__label__pl	Idź do domu i trochę pośpij.
__label__pl	Każdy zna jego imię.
__label__pl	Nie wystarczyło im pieniędzy.
__label__pl	Kupiłam jej lalkę.
__label__pl	Chciałabym podziękować swoim przyjaciółkom za wsparcie.
__label__pl	Jestem piłkarzem.
__label__pl	Jestem piłkarką.
__label__pl	Tylko dla pełnoletnich.
__label__pl	Tak w ogóle masz czas dzisiaj wieczorem?
__label__pl	Jezioro cieszy się złą sławą z powodu zanieczyszczenia.
__label__pl	Bardzo ci do twarzy w tym krawacie.
__label__pl	W rzeczywistości to złudzenie.
__label__pl	Coimbra jest znana ze swojego uniwersytetu.
__label__pl	Moja współlokatorka to wariatka.
__label__pl	Tom rzadko robi błędy, kiedy pisze po francusku.
__label__pl	Ona z nią w ogóle nie rozmawia.
__label__pl	Jestem dumny ze swojej punktualności.
__label__pl	Wszystko wydaje się takie dziwne.
__label__pl	Chowam się od nich.
__label__pl	W następnym tygodniu będę w Australii.
__label__pl	Tom pragnie miłości.
__label__pl	Twój koniec jest bliski.
__label__pl	Ona ma zajęczą wargę.
__label__pl	Nie ma żadnych podstaw do skargi.
__label__pl	Przeczytałem tę książkę trzy razy.
__label__pl	Nigdy sobie tego nie wybaczę.
__label__pl	Wszystko to wrogie knowania.
__label__pl	Wiemy o was wszystko.
__label__pl	Nigdy bym jej nie zatrudnił.
__label__pl	Nikt nie chce grać ze mną w szachy.
__label__pl	Tom ma niski głos.
__label__pl	Tom zaczął mnie ignorować.

__label__pl	Robin Hood rabował bogaczy.
__label__pl	Cudzoziemcy zmuszeni są opuścić kraj.
__label__pl	Nie wylejcie dziecka z kąpielą.
__label__pl	Lepiej mi się myśli w czasie spaceru.
__label__pl	Powiedział, że przyjdzie jutro.
__label__pl	Właśnie zostałem dziadkiem.
__label__pl	Tom przyjął przeprosiny.
__label__pl	Dlaczego wielbłądy nienawidzą koni?
__label__pl	Brat prawie doprowadził mnie do szaleństwa.
__label__pl	Tom dobrze zarabia.
__label__pl	Tom zjadł jabłko.
__label__pl	Nie uważam Toma za wielkiego człowieka.
__label__pl	Dziękuję za herbatę.
__label__pl	Poprosił o pomoc, ale nikt nie przyszedł.
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie chcesz uczyć się angielskiego?
__label__pl	To muzeum nie jest czynne w poniedziałki.

__label__pl	Koronawirus to wirus RNA.
__label__pl	Koronawirus jest wirusem RNA.
__label__pl	Koronawirus pojawił się w Chinach.
__label__pl	To do niego niepodobne.
__label__pl	Do kogo on jest podobny?
__label__pl	Moja siostra co roku jeździ w Karpaty.
__label__pl	Tom zapisał w testamencie cały swój majątek miastu.
__label__pl	Całe miasto pokryte było żółtym pyłem.
__label__pl	Byłem wówczas bardzo biedny.
__label__pl	Od tego zależy moja przyszłość.
__label__pl	Tom rzucił okiem na zegarek.
__label__pl	Nie chodzę do kościoła.
__label__pl	Nie chodzę do cerkwi.
__label__pl	To jest cerkiew.
__label__pl	Prawosławni uważają katolików za heretyków.

__label__pl	W tym roku prawosławna Pascha zbiega się z katolicką.

__label__pl	Koronawirus powoduje uporczywy kaszel.
__label__pl	Stawiaj opór!
__label__pl	Umrzyj.
__label__pl	Do wzięcia?
__label__pl	Czas działać!
__label__pl	Wystarczy na dziś.
__label__pl	Dla mnie też.
__label__pl	Nie mam kuchenki mikrofalowej.
__label__pl	Widzę dno morza.
__label__pl	To brzmi prawie jak groźba.
__label__pl	Wyglądasz na trzeźwego.
__label__pl	Za każdym razem, kiedy obok przejeżdża ciężarówka, mój dom się trzęsie.
__label__pl	Elektryczność drożeje.
__label__pl	Zostałem w domu ze względu na pogodę.
__label__pl	Próbujesz mnie otruć?
__label__pl	Aminokwasy tworzą białka.
__label__pl	Przeczytałem wczoraj artykuł o kwaśnych deszczach.
__label__pl	Ustawy oparte są na konstytucji.
__label__pl	Konstytucja jest ustawą zasadniczą państwa.
__label__pl	W cerkwi znajduje się dwurzędowy pozłacany ikonostas.

__label__pl	On jest jeszcze w pracy.
__label__pl	Patrz w przyszłość!
__label__pl	Człowiek nigdy nie jest za stary na naukę
__label__pl	Nie wiem o niczym.
__label__pl	Z przyjemnością ci pomogę.
__label__pl	Przyjmuję twoje zaproszenie z przyjemnością.
__label__pl	Przyjmuję wasze zaproszenie z przyjemnością.
__label__pl	Dla ciebie zrobię to z przyjemnością.
__label__pl	Psy i koty kłócą się z przyjemnością.

__label__pl	Pracuję z Hiszpanem.
__label__pl	On płaci kartą.
__label__pl	Nie dyskutuj z lustrem.

__label__pl	Czy ona też idzie?
__label__pl	Jasne, ty mnie też!
__label__pl	Jestem też turystą.
__label__pl	Ona jest też sprzedawczynią.
__label__pl	Wszyscy na zdjęciu się uśmiechają.
__label__pl	Nie baw się na ulicy.
__label__pl	On leży na ławce.
__label__pl	On jest w ubikacji.
__label__pl	Tom pali na balkonie.
__label__pl	Na balkonie leży śnieg.
__label__pl	Gołąb grucha na balkonie.
__label__pl	Zjadłem śniadanie na balkonie.
__label__pl	Dla mnie mleko odtłuszczone.
__label__pl	Dziękuję za wytłumaczenie.
__label__pl	Walczyliśmy dla wszystkich.
__label__pl	Trudno mi było napisać ten list po francusku.
__label__pl	To jest na rogu.
__label__pl	Wypadek zdarzył się na rogu.
__label__pl	Na rogu skręć w lewo.
__label__pl	Ten dom na rogu jest nasz.
__label__pl	Mógłby się pan zatrzymać tam na rogu?
__label__pl	Ona zamawia napój przy barze.
__label__pl	Wierzysz w Boga?
__label__pl	To graniczy z cudem.
__label__pl	Tom umarł na zapalenie płuc.
__label__pl	Ona uczy w wiejskiej szkole.
__label__pl	Tom umarł w wyniku przedawkowania.
__label__pl	Tom siedział sam przy stole.
__label__pl	Tom siedzi przy stole.
__label__pl	Pamiętasz o tym?
__label__pl	Pamiętam to słowo.
__label__pl	Przywykłem do tego klimatu.
__label__pl	Mężczyźni myślą tylko o jednym.
__label__pl	Sami pracował tam sześć miesięcy.
__label__pl	Tom chwycił pieniądze i uciekł.
__label__pl	Nie lubię mojej szkoły.
__label__pl	To jest nasza wspólna stacja robocza.
__label__pl	Tom ma zadrapanie na czole.
__label__pl	Ludzie zaczęli wyć.
__label__pl	Dziękuję za odnośnik.
__label__pl	Tom złamał kostkę.
__label__pl	Oni chcieli mnie zabić.
__label__pl	One chciały mnie zabić.
__label__pl	Straciłem już rachubę czasu.
__label__pl	Chciałeś mnie zabić?
__label__pl	Mylą mi się już dni tygodnia.
__label__pl	On jest zbyt gruby.
__label__pl	To inna skrajność.
__label__pl	Chcieliście mnie zabić?
__label__pl	Chciał mnie pan zabić?
__label__pl	Chciała mnie pani zabić?
__label__pl	Odwiedziłem go.
__label__pl	Polegam na nim.
__label__pl	On nie wygra.
__label__pl	On nie zwycięży.
__label__pl	To, co zrobił Tom, było nieuczciwe.
__label__pl	To, co zrobiłaś, było nieuczciwe.
__label__pl	To, co zrobiłeś, było nieuczciwe.
__label__pl	To, co zrobiliście, było nieuczciwe.
__label__pl	Znowu przegraliśmy.
__label__pl	Uspokoił się.
__label__pl	Mógłby zwyciężyć.
__label__pl	Mógłby wygrać.
__label__pl	Udowodniono, że jest złodziejem.
__label__pl	Masz rację?
__label__pl	Znałem twojego ojca.
__label__pl	Kto zabił Toma?
__label__pl	Tom się ciebie boi.
__label__pl	Postaram się.
__label__pl	Ach tak!
__label__pl	No tak!
__label__pl	Oby tak dalej!
__label__pl	Ale duży!
__label__pl	Co za nonsens!
__label__pl	Tom nie często się uśmiecha, ale czasem mu się zdarza.
__label__pl	Większe zbiory powinny pomóc skompensować spodziewany spadek cen płodów rolnych.
__label__pl	Czy istnieje jakiś sposób, żeby zrekompensować te koszty?
__label__pl	Tom i Mary są oboje obywatelami Kanady.
__label__pl	Tom wyglądał na skorego do zaimponowania mi.
__label__pl	Spotkanie nie potrwa długo.
__label__pl	Istnieją ulgi podatkowe pomagające skompensować koszty.
__label__pl	Lubisz chodzić na koncerty?
__label__pl	Tom używa opalarki.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział okropne rzeczy na mój temat.
__label__pl	Cholera jasna!
__label__pl	Niech to szlag!
__label__pl	Tak to jest.
__label__pl	Nie tak prędko!
__label__pl	Tym lepiej!
__label__pl	Rób tak dalej!
__label__pl	Ale wtopa!
__label__pl	Co za skurwiel!
__label__pl	Nie mówcie tak.
__label__pl	Ale głupota!
__label__pl	Co za bzdura!
__label__pl	Co za bełkot!
__label__pl	Ale upał!
__label__pl	Ale skwar!
__label__pl	Oby tak było!
__label__pl	Nie hałasuj tak!
__label__pl	Wszyscy tak myślą.
__label__pl	Rób tak dalej.
__label__pl	Tak było.
__label__pl	Kto tak myśli?
__label__pl	Niechętnie.
__label__pl	Tak ja to czuję.
__label__pl	Nie pędź tak!
__label__pl	Co za bezczelność!
__label__pl	Oby tak dalej, Tom!
__label__pl	Tak to działa.
__label__pl	Wszyscy tak uważają.
__label__pl	Nie bądź taki.
__label__pl	Już tak późno!
__label__pl	Jestem taki spasiony.
__label__pl	Nie mów tak głośno!
__label__pl	Było tak ciemno.
__label__pl	Nie biegnij tak szybko.
__label__pl	On jest tak bardzo gejem.
__label__pl	Ale się najadłem.
__label__pl	Jestem taki pełny.
__label__pl	Jesteś taki piękny!
__label__pl	Takie życie.
__label__pl	Jestem taki tłusty.
__label__pl	To powinno być tak.
__label__pl	Skąd tyle nienawiści?
__label__pl	Tak jest lepiej.
__label__pl	Tak mi jej brakuje.
__label__pl	Tak mówi prawo.
__label__pl	To powinno załatwić sprawę.
__label__pl	Nie mów tak szybko.
__label__pl	Nie mówicie tak szybko.
__label__pl	Ale ona jest duża!
__label__pl	Jestem taki przepracowany.
__label__pl	Ale to jest nudne.
__label__pl	Jestem taki szczęśliwy!
__label__pl	Taki się urodziłem.
__label__pl	Oni byli tacy różni.
__label__pl	Jestem taki wolny!
__label__pl	Większość tak myśli.
__label__pl	Ale ty jesteś słodki!
__label__pl	Jesteś taki słodki!
__label__pl	Tak, tak to działa.
__label__pl	Nie bądź taki ograniczony!
__label__pl	Nie bądźcie tacy ograniczeni!
__label__pl	Nie hamuj tak gwałtownie!
__label__pl	Nie bądźcie tacy dziecinni.
__label__pl	Na koronawirusa pomaga tylko jedno: odporność.
__label__pl	"Jaka jest prawda o koronawirusie?" - "Kto to wie?"
__label__pl	Zostańcie w domu! Koronawirus nadchodzi.
__label__pl	Liczba osób zarażonych koronawirusem w Europie nadal rośnie.
__label__pl	Wzięliśmy koronawirus od pierwszego dnia na poważnie.
__label__pl	Koronawirus ogranicza ruch turystyczny.
__label__pl	Koronawirus nie będzie się przenosił drogą powietrzną.
__label__pl	Chińskie służby medyczne podejmują działania w celu ograniczenia rozprzestrzeniania się koronawirusa.
__label__pl	Dziś popołudniu Światowa Organizacja Zdrowia potwierdziła trzy tysiące nowych przypadków zakażenia koronawirusem, w tym sto zmarłych.
__label__pl	Na całym świecie ludzie z powodu koronawirusa gromadzą papier toaletowy. Psychologia wyjaśnia Tomowi dlaczego.
__label__pl	Prezydent przepowiedział, że rynek akcji po zniknięciu koronawirusa "odbije się w sposób jakiego nikt do tej pory nie widział".
__label__pl	W ramach walki z rozprzestrzenianiem się koronawirusa, Indie zamknęły kultowy Taj Mahal, jeden z najczęściej odwiedzanych zabytków na świecie.
__label__pl	Do 10 milionów Niemców mogłoby się zarazić koronawirusem, gdyby nie zostały podjęte stosowne środki zapobiegawcze, w tym dystansowanie społeczne
__label__pl	Tak uczę się angielskiego.
__label__pl	Tak słyszałem.
__label__pl	Ty jesteś taki dzielny!
__label__pl	Ale ty jesteś odważny!
__label__pl	Raz tak, a raz tak.
__label__pl	Raz tak, a raz inaczej.
__label__pl	Lubisz tak żyć?
__label__pl	Nie bądź taki niecierpliwy!
__label__pl	Jestem taki zdezorientowany!
__label__pl	To jest takie idiotyczne!
__label__pl	Jakie ziarno, taki chleb.
__label__pl	Jaki kraj, tacy ludzie.
__label__pl	Myślę tak jak ty.
__label__pl	Nic nie jest takie, jakim się wydaje.
__label__pl	Byłem kiedyś taki jak ty.
__label__pl	Z tego co mi wiadomo, nie.
__label__pl	Dziękuję, że pytasz.
__label__pl	Dziękuję, że pytacie.
__label__pl	Dziękuję, że Pan pyta.
__label__pl	Mało prawdopodobne, że to będzie działać.
__label__pl	Dobrze, że przyszliście.
__label__pl	Dobrze, że przyszedłeś.
__label__pl	Dziękuję, że Pan zadzwonił.
__label__pl	Myślę, że rozumiem.
__label__pl	Przepraszam, że ci przeszkadzam.
__label__pl	Możesz ruszać.
__label__pl	Mogę przyjść jutro.
__label__pl	Mógłbym się zrzygać.
__label__pl	Mam ochotę się zrzygać.
__label__pl	Znacie francuski?
__label__pl	Możecie iść.
__label__pl	Potraficie czytać?
__label__pl	Tom mógłby to zrobić.
__label__pl	Każdy mógłby to zrobić.
__label__pl	Mogliście umrzeć.
__label__pl	Moglibyście to powtórzyć?
__label__pl	Mogłeś spać?
__label__pl	Mógłbyś to powtórzyć?
__label__pl	Mógłby pan jechać wolniej?
__label__pl	Mogłem się zranić.
__label__pl	Tom i Markku mogli zostać przyjaciółmi.
__label__pl	Każdy wierzy, że sny mogą się spełniać.
__label__pl	To nie jego charakter pisma.
__label__pl	Każdy chciałby wierzyć, że sny mogą się spełniać.
__label__pl	Wieloryby to nie ryby.
__label__pl	Ludzie mają krótką pamięć.
__label__pl	On zagotował wodę ze strumienia, żeby była bezpieczna do spożycia.
__label__pl	Nie waż się wtrącać w moje sprawy.
__label__pl	Samolot musiał przymusowo lądować.
__label__pl	Nie mogę wrócić.
__label__pl	Nie mogę narzekać.
__label__pl	Nie mogę nic jeść.
__label__pl	Nie mogę patrzeć.
__label__pl	Możemy pomóc?
__label__pl	Gdzie możemy zaparkować?
__label__pl	Gdzie możemy zjeść?
__label__pl	Gdzie możemy to kupić?
__label__pl	Gdzie możemy cię spotkać?
__label__pl	Gdzie możemy was spotkać?
__label__pl	Jak to mogło się stać?
__label__pl	Jak mogłeś to zrobić?
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie możesz zostać?
__label__pl	Nie pozostało mi nic innego, niż go zwolnić.
__label__pl	Jestem od pana ładniejszy.
__label__pl	Nikt nie wie tego lepiej od was.
__label__pl	To jest trudniejsze, niż myślisz.
__label__pl	Jesteście lepsi, niż myślicie.
__label__pl	Ona jest młodsza od Pana siostry.
__label__pl	Potrzebujemy więcej, niż to.
__label__pl	Czy to jest lepsze od oryginału?
__label__pl	Co mogłoby być bardziej niemieckie od tego?
__label__pl	On jest starszy niż jej ojciec.
__label__pl	Nie jestem w domu.
__label__pl	Od teraz uczmy się rano.
__label__pl	Ucz się więcej od teraz.
__label__pl	Od teraz wszystko będzie łatwiejsze.
__label__pl	Od teraz będziemy w kontakcie.
__label__pl	Od teraz mówimy tylko po francusku.
__label__pl	Słowaccy pszczelarze zdobyli sześć medali na międzynarodowej konferencji w Argentynie.
__label__pl	Straciłem pracę.
__label__pl	Jestem pewien, że wiesz jak to jest.
__label__pl	Tom jest bardzo mądry, prawda?
__label__pl	Mój ojciec jest zawsze zajęty.
__label__pl	Poczekajmy tutaj.
__label__pl	Czy dlatego tu jestem?
__label__pl	Powiedziałem dzień dobry.
__label__pl	Pomogłem.
__label__pl	Jem zupę.
__label__pl	Jemy słodycze.
__label__pl	Jestem obecnie na służbie.
__label__pl	Nie jesteśmy szaleni.
__label__pl	Za bardzo się martwię.
__label__pl	Jestem tu z Tomem.
__label__pl	Tom jest więźniem.
__label__pl	Czuję się tu bezpiecznie.
__label__pl	Spóźniłam się na samolot.
__label__pl	Dużo płakałem.
__label__pl	Marie zgubiła swoją kartę pokładową.
__label__pl	Czy powiadomiłeś Toma?
__label__pl	Zabrał pan to ze sobą?
__label__pl	Zwykle jem poza domem.
__label__pl	Co piszecie?
__label__pl	Jestem twoim szefem.
__label__pl	Chcę to jeszcze raz zobaczyć.
__label__pl	Idziemy razem.
__label__pl	Kiedy pracujesz?
__label__pl	Wy macie mój telefon.
__label__pl	Czy są twoje?
__label__pl	Te sprawy potrzebują czasu.
__label__pl	Niech pan da mi klucz.
__label__pl	Zaśpiewamy.
__label__pl	To jest mój ołówek.
__label__pl	Osłaniaj mnie!
__label__pl	Z tego powodu tu przyszedłem.
__label__pl	Ile widelców potrzebujemy?
__label__pl	Nie ruszaj się stąd.
__label__pl	Chcemy pomóc.
__label__pl	Co jest teraz w telewizji?
__label__pl	Lubię filmy animowane.
__label__pl	Jeszcze raz dziękuję!
__label__pl	Nie, nie rozumiem.
__label__pl	Nadal jestem sam.
__label__pl	Wracają.
__label__pl	Nawet Tom to wiedział.
__label__pl	Zobaczysz to.
__label__pl	Widziałem to.
__label__pl	Lubię tu mieszkać.
__label__pl	Znaleźliśmy Toma.
__label__pl	Musisz wezwać lekarza.
__label__pl	Byłem nieśmiały.
__label__pl	Nie chodzi o pieniądze.
__label__pl	Idźcie do łóżka!
__label__pl	Pływam codziennie.
__label__pl	Nie idziesz z nami?
__label__pl	Co się stanie?
__label__pl	Tom jest twoim wrogiem.
__label__pl	Czy lubisz koty?
__label__pl	To wiele dla mnie znaczy.
__label__pl	Będę ostrożny.
__label__pl	Bądź dla niej miły.
__label__pl	Tom jest zaniepokojony.
__label__pl	Nie potrzebujemy tego teraz robić.
__label__pl	Idź się kąpać!
__label__pl	Będę musiał na to spojrzeć.
__label__pl	Zdecyduj się!
__label__pl	Dorastaliśmy razem.
__label__pl	Nie nazywam się Tom.
__label__pl	Dlaczego ludzie to mówią?
__label__pl	Byłem tylko zdenerwowany.
__label__pl	Jesteś winny.
__label__pl	Kupuję samochód.
__label__pl	Jesteście naszymi gośćmi.
__label__pl	On jest czysty.
__label__pl	Dziś nie ma lekcji.
__label__pl	To jest frachtowiec.
__label__pl	Musisz być szalony.
__label__pl	Przeczytałem dużo książek.
__label__pl	Tom jest bardzo biedny.
__label__pl	Wykonuję całą pracę.
__label__pl	Czy mogę tego tutaj użyć?
__label__pl	Chleb jest miękki.
__label__pl	Szybko jecie.
__label__pl	Tom jest leniwy.
__label__pl	Będzie gorąco.
__label__pl	Wstanę.
__label__pl	Nie zrobiłem nic złego.
__label__pl	Poszliśmy na narty.
__label__pl	Jak się dzisiaj macie?
__label__pl	Chcę gotówkę.
__label__pl	Pilnie potrzebuję pomocy.
__label__pl	To był Tom.
__label__pl	Potrzebuję więcej miejsca.
__label__pl	Bądźcie ostrożni!
__label__pl	Znamy się od trzech lat.
__label__pl	Proszę iść dalej.
__label__pl	To było nieuniknione.
__label__pl	Po prostu mam szczęście.
__label__pl	Jesteście gorsi niż Tom.
__label__pl	Bądź cicho i słuchaj.
__label__pl	O co chce mnie pan zapytać?
__label__pl	Chciał zobaczyć dowody.
__label__pl	Mogę spróbować.
__label__pl	Pocałowałem ją w policzek.
__label__pl	Jak minął ci spacer?
__label__pl	Czy mam ci załatwić bilet na koncert?
__label__pl	Będę współpracować.
__label__pl	Po prostu bądź blisko!
__label__pl	Nie powinienem pić.
__label__pl	Nie rozumiesz tego?
__label__pl	Jesteśmy wstrząśnięci.
__label__pl	Nie możecie tego zabrać ze sobą.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy doświadczeni.
__label__pl	On idzie do pracy.
__label__pl	Tom jest mordercą.
__label__pl	Nikt się o to nie martwi.
__label__pl	Opanujcie się.
__label__pl	Nikt nie może się temu oprzeć.
__label__pl	Pozwól Tomowi wrócić do domu!
__label__pl	Czy to jest trujące?
__label__pl	Kochałem cię.
__label__pl	Czy mogę wypożyczyć ten słownik?
__label__pl	Jecie mięso.
__label__pl	Chcę zobaczyć więcej.
__label__pl	Otworzyłem drzwi.
__label__pl	To jest mój chłopiec.
__label__pl	On wygląda blado.
__label__pl	Zaczęła śpiewać.
__label__pl	To jego zadanie.
__label__pl	Zawołaj swojego brata.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy daleko od domu.
__label__pl	Gdzie jest Tony?
__label__pl	Tom może go przyprowadzić.
__label__pl	Niech pan zostawi to mnie!
__label__pl	Niech pan wróci jutro!
__label__pl	Gdzie jest mój kierowca?
__label__pl	Przekręcił klucz.
__label__pl	Drzwi skrzypnęły.
__label__pl	Gdzie jest mój pamiętnik?
__label__pl	Idziemy do szpitala.
__label__pl	Potrzebuję mapę.
__label__pl	To się państwu spodoba.
__label__pl	Sprzątaliśmy pokój na zmianę.
__label__pl	Czy Tom miał wrogów?
__label__pl	Jest pan teraz sam.
__label__pl	Nie kłamię.
__label__pl	Był pan zagrożony.
__label__pl	Tom lubi czytać.
__label__pl	Jem warzywa.
__label__pl	Idę prosto do domu.
__label__pl	Idź prosto do domu.
__label__pl	Tom ma proste włosy.
__label__pl	Tom gapił się prosto przed siebie.
__label__pl	Tom pojechał prosto do domu.
__label__pl	Poszedłem prosto do domu.
__label__pl	Mam proste włosy.
__label__pl	Tom wrócił prosto do domu.
__label__pl	Tom patrzył prosto przed siebie.
__label__pl	Lubię mleko.
__label__pl	Tom jest tylko dzieckiem.
__label__pl	Jak się to nazywa?
__label__pl	Chciałbym to.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy znudzeni.
__label__pl	Zaprosiłeś go?
__label__pl	Jutro będziemy pracować.
__label__pl	Daj mi nóż.
__label__pl	Boję się o was.
__label__pl	Dlaczego musisz to robić?
__label__pl	Podoba mi się tutaj.
__label__pl	To nic nie daje.
__label__pl	Kto znalazł moją torbę?
__label__pl	Tom był jednym z nas.
__label__pl	Ilu surferów widzieliście?
__label__pl	Wszyscy płaczą.
__label__pl	To jajko jest twarde.
__label__pl	Czy myślałeś o tym?
__label__pl	Muszę to zrobić jeszcze raz.
__label__pl	Jestem dumny z bycia nauczycielem.
__label__pl	Tom potrzebuje płaszcza.
__label__pl	Jesteście wrogami.
__label__pl	To jest dziwaczne.
__label__pl	Potrzebuję drugiej szansy.
__label__pl	Jecie mięso?
__label__pl	Wyglądają na zadowolonych.
__label__pl	Tom jest uchodźcą.
__label__pl	Niech pan spróbuje tego sosu.
__label__pl	Idą do piekarni.
__label__pl	To nic takiego.
__label__pl	Tom to zaproponował.
__label__pl	Zabierz swój hełm!
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie pójdziemy gdzieś razem?
__label__pl	Moje prawo jazdy ma Tom.
__label__pl	To było bardzo bolesne.
__label__pl	Cały dzień padał deszcz.
__label__pl	Ktoś chowa się w kącie.
__label__pl	Potrzebuję czegoś do pisania.
__label__pl	Zapłacę później.
__label__pl	Czy on ma szansę na powrót do zdrowia?
__label__pl	Czy ostrzegł pan Toma?
__label__pl	Wierzycie w to?
__label__pl	Schowałeś pieniądze?
__label__pl	Zejdź mi z drogi.
__label__pl	On boi się psów.
__label__pl	Ma ponad trzydzieści lat.
__label__pl	Tom jest zapominalski.
__label__pl	Znam już to ćwiczenie.
__label__pl	Tom rozpalił ogień.
__label__pl	On ma kartę kredytową.
__label__pl	Nadal ją mam.
__label__pl	Mój pokój ma tylko jedno okno.
__label__pl	On lubi gotować.
__label__pl	Tom jest zabawny.
__label__pl	Czy mogę tam usiąść?
__label__pl	Okłamałeś nas.
__label__pl	Bez wątpienia.
__label__pl	Dlaczego Tom jest mokry?
__label__pl	Coś się właśnie dzieje.
__label__pl	Dlaczego miałbym czekać?
__label__pl	Właśnie się wprowadziłem.
__label__pl	Mam związane ręce.
__label__pl	Zabiorę cię do domu.
__label__pl	Dlaczego to jest tutaj?
__label__pl	Czy mogę zadać inne pytanie?
__label__pl	Miałam straszne przeziębienie.
__label__pl	Wszystko jest źle.
__label__pl	Tom zapłacił czynsz.
__label__pl	Uśmiechają się.
__label__pl	Dlaczego to robię?
__label__pl	Czy jest coś do zrobienia?
__label__pl	Jak ci się podoba?
__label__pl	Zostaniemy w kontakcie.
__label__pl	Potrzebuję kopert.
__label__pl	Jestem niezwykły.
__label__pl	Dużo biegaliśmy.
__label__pl	Tutaj rozbijemy nasz obóz.
__label__pl	Pobiliście Toma?
__label__pl	Musimy to zrobić teraz.
__label__pl	Na stole leży melon.
__label__pl	To mogłoby mi się podobać.
__label__pl	Wszyscy musimy współpracować.
__label__pl	Wszyscy się uśmiechają.
__label__pl	On jest bardzo młody.
__label__pl	Własnie pościmy.
__label__pl	Zmęczymy się.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy na właściwym piętrze.
__label__pl	Dałem słowo.
__label__pl	Przynieś kilka koców.
__label__pl	To całkiem możliwe.
__label__pl	Ma całkowitą rację.
__label__pl	Jesteś bardzo mądry.
__label__pl	Nie mogę pana wpuścić.
__label__pl	Uwielbiam to!
__label__pl	Nie byłem w mieście.
__label__pl	Widzicie drzewo.
__label__pl	Jestem swoim własnym szefem.
__label__pl	W sali jest dwudziestu pięciu uczniów.
__label__pl	Niczego od ciebie nie oczekuję.
__label__pl	Czy czuje się pan dzisiaj lepiej?
__label__pl	Jestem rannym ptaszkiem.
__label__pl	Pan sam często to mówił.
__label__pl	Niech pan to sprawdzi!
__label__pl	Opowiesz o tym Tomowi?
__label__pl	Nie ruszaj się z tego miejsca.
__label__pl	Tom był zbyt gruby.
__label__pl	Chodziłem do szkoły pieszo.
__label__pl	Jeszcze oddycha.
__label__pl	Jak zareagował Tom?
__label__pl	Ma pan raka.
__label__pl	To nie jest wskazane.
__label__pl	To jest pyszne.
__label__pl	To zły przykład.
__label__pl	Ona ma szczęście.
__label__pl	Nie zazdroszczę panu.
__label__pl	Potrzebujesz terapii.
__label__pl	Jestem trochę pijany.
__label__pl	To jest wspaniałe!
__label__pl	Czy ktoś siedział w samochodzie?
__label__pl	Nie może pan temu zaprzeczyć.
__label__pl	Widzę żyrafę.
__label__pl	Uwielbiam kiszoną kapustę.
__label__pl	Przyjdę sam.
__label__pl	Co będą robić?
__label__pl	Co oni zrobią?
__label__pl	Koty są słodkie.
__label__pl	Co robimy?
__label__pl	O czym wy mówicie?
__label__pl	Zatrzymał pan Toma?
__label__pl	Tom będzie gruby.
__label__pl	Mógłbyś mi pomóc.
__label__pl	Załóż swój kapelusz!
__label__pl	Ma pan godzinę czasu.
__label__pl	Będę pracować sam.
__label__pl	Jest kolegą z pracy.
__label__pl	Ta walizka jest dla pana za ciężka.
__label__pl	Życie jest niesprawiedliwe.
__label__pl	Wytniemy to drzewo.
__label__pl	Nie jestem bohaterem.
__label__pl	Byłem łatwowierny.
__label__pl	Do zobaczenia w październiku.
__label__pl	Co zostało?
__label__pl	Dlaczego jest tak gorąco?
__label__pl	Widzimy drzewo.
__label__pl	Oni się nienawidzą.
__label__pl	Piję wodę.
__label__pl	Tom jest teraz bezpieczny.
__label__pl	Chciałbym ją zobaczyć!
__label__pl	Zmywam.
__label__pl	On jest moim kolegą ze studiów.
__label__pl	On oślepł.
__label__pl	Bądź mężczyzną!
__label__pl	Zbiegliśmy ze wzgórza.
__label__pl	Spojrzałem.
__label__pl	Tom jest dobrym chłopcem.
__label__pl	Znalazłem te pieniądze.
__label__pl	Nie potrafię gotować.
__label__pl	Zostań chwilkę.
__label__pl	Wyglądają dobrze.
__label__pl	Chcesz obejrzeć?
__label__pl	To delikatny problem.
__label__pl	Chodźmy razem na obiad.
__label__pl	Zaufaj.
__label__pl	Ufam wam wszystkim.
__label__pl	Tom ufa Marii.
__label__pl	Czy potrzebuję prawnika?
__label__pl	Tom był pewny siebie.
__label__pl	Ona jest dobrą uczennicą.
__label__pl	Pan musi nam pomóc.
__label__pl	Jest pan więźniem.
__label__pl	Całe miasto było w ciemności.
__label__pl	Czy jest przesolona?
__label__pl	Czy pies szczekał?
__label__pl	Na świecie jest wielu idiotów.
__label__pl	Tom nie jest ranny, ale Mary jest.
__label__pl	Nie mam żadnego doświadczenia.
__label__pl	Czy jest to o wiele łatwiejsze w użyciu?
__label__pl	Byliśmy tu pierwsi.
__label__pl	Tom miał pistolet.
__label__pl	Może powinieneś wziąć kilka dni wolnego.
__label__pl	Jak myślisz, jaki rozmiar butów nosi Tom?
__label__pl	Możesz to dostać?
__label__pl	Chciałbym móc to zrobić lepiej.
__label__pl	Czy to mój szlafrok?
__label__pl	Byłem bardzo smutny, gdy zmarł Tom.
__label__pl	Tom idzie na studia do Bostonu.
__label__pl	Tom nigdy nie rozmawiał z Mary.
__label__pl	Czy jest z tym problem?
__label__pl	Co jest dobre?
__label__pl	Miałbyś troszeczkę czasu?
__label__pl	Pan pije sok.
__label__pl	Oni piją sok.
__label__pl	Ta książka mi się podobała.
__label__pl	On nadchodzi.
__label__pl	Jest pan zarozumiały.
__label__pl	Popełnił błąd.
__label__pl	Jak byście się czuli.
__label__pl	Tort zostanie zaraz pokrojony.
__label__pl	Chcę to dojeść.
__label__pl	On idzie.
__label__pl	Ten samochód jest czarny.
__label__pl	Jest nas trzech.
__label__pl	To beznadziejny przypadek.
__label__pl	Zastrzelę cię.
__label__pl	Przeczytaliście to?
__label__pl	Kupuję łóżko.
__label__pl	Nakarmiłem psa.
__label__pl	Widzisz filiżankę.
__label__pl	Połknij tabletkę.
__label__pl	Mam długą brodę.
__label__pl	Znalazłem to tam.
__label__pl	To nie było nasze.
__label__pl	Tom zadzwoni.
__label__pl	Poszczę.
__label__pl	Tom mnie uderzył.
__label__pl	Tom chce się uczyć.
__label__pl	Czy to jest słodkie?
__label__pl	Prześpij się teraz trochę.
__label__pl	Czy macie jakiś plan?
__label__pl	To jest wybieg dla odwrócenia uwagi.
__label__pl	Czekają na odlot.
__label__pl	Pewnego dnia mi podziękujesz.
__label__pl	Ceny są wysokie.
__label__pl	Jesteście szaleni!
__label__pl	To pasuje.
__label__pl	Słonie jedzą trawę.
__label__pl	Popełniłeś straszny błąd.
__label__pl	Pije słodkie mleko.
__label__pl	Co powinniśmy dzisiaj zrobić?
__label__pl	To naprawdę proste.
__label__pl	On jest w kłopotach.
__label__pl	Sprzedaję mój komputer.
__label__pl	To jest mylące.
__label__pl	Woda jest ciepła.
__label__pl	Teraz jestem naprawdę zdezorientowany.
__label__pl	Naprawia dach.
__label__pl	Tom zabił Marię.
__label__pl	Spanikowałem.
__label__pl	Ile filiżanek kawy wypiłeś już dzisiaj?
__label__pl	On sprzeciwia się naszemu planowi.
__label__pl	Sprawdź to jeszcze raz.
__label__pl	Sprawdź to teraz.
__label__pl	Tom poczuł gaz.
__label__pl	Tom kradnie różne rzeczy.
__label__pl	Tom ma to nagrane.

__label__pl	Tom jest jednym z moich pacjentów.
__label__pl	Nowy koronawirus jest bardzo zakaźny.
__label__pl	Nudzisz się?
__label__pl	Są w domu.
__label__pl	Trzeba je usunąć.
__label__pl	Czy możemy sobie na to pozwolić?
__label__pl	Puść mnie!
__label__pl	Jak bardzo się spóźniłem?
__label__pl	Kto pomógł Tomowi?
__label__pl	Potrafię prowadzić samochód.
__label__pl	Zrobiłem to dla pana.
__label__pl	Czy jesteś teraz sam?
__label__pl	Proszę włączyć!
__label__pl	To trwało cały dzień.
__label__pl	Kocham moją matkę.
__label__pl	Ta szara mysz jest duża.
__label__pl	On dużo mówi.
__label__pl	Naprawdę jest mi przykro!
__label__pl	Zostaw to w spokoju!
__label__pl	Jestem tu zupełnie sam.
__label__pl	Czy jesz jajka?
__label__pl	Niech pan to po prostu kontroluje.
__label__pl	Niech pan wypełni ten wniosek!
__label__pl	Zraniliście mnie.
__label__pl	Czy jesteś sprawiedliwy?
__label__pl	Czy jedziemy daleko?
__label__pl	Muszę zobaczyć ten film.
__label__pl	Do czego on dąży?
__label__pl	Nie mogłem iść.
__label__pl	Tom jest zdenerwowany.
__label__pl	Daj mi klucze!
__label__pl	Czy dzieci chodzą do szkoły?
__label__pl	Piję słodkie mleko.
__label__pl	Tom poszedł jeść.
__label__pl	Spanikowałem i uciekłem.
__label__pl	To mnie uszczęśliwi.
__label__pl	Nie zjem dziś śniadania.
__label__pl	Czy to komplement?
__label__pl	On ma siedmiu synów.
__label__pl	Tym razem my wygraliśmy.
__label__pl	Moja matka ugotowała dziesięć jajek.
__label__pl	Nie mam talentu.
__label__pl	Kto pamięta?
__label__pl	Kto sobie przypomina?
__label__pl	Bardzo chciałbym zostać.
__label__pl	Wszyscy to robią.
__label__pl	Straciłem twarz.
__label__pl	Nikt nie powinien tego wiedzieć.
__label__pl	Mogę ci dopomóc.
__label__pl	Wszyscy jesteśmy ze sobą spokrewnieni.
__label__pl	Ona ma dobry argument.
__label__pl	Ty ją znasz.
__label__pl	Po prostu powiedz nie.
__label__pl	Śniłem.
__label__pl	Poczekajcie z tym do poniedziałku!
__label__pl	Oni pomogą.
__label__pl	Będę studiować.
__label__pl	Dlaczego jesteś smutny?
__label__pl	Nie zaszkodziłoby.
__label__pl	Jest pan otoczony.
__label__pl	Czy jest jeszcze więcej?
__label__pl	Nie widzę go.
__label__pl	Ta herbata jest słodka.
__label__pl	Najważniejsze najpierw.
__label__pl	Tom zawiedzie.
__label__pl	Będziemy głodować.
__label__pl	Jak długo chcecie to zatrzymać?
__label__pl	Dlaczego tam idziesz?
__label__pl	Światło było włączone.
__label__pl	Dobrze wiedzieć.
__label__pl	Nie byłem głodny.
__label__pl	Ciężko oddychała.
__label__pl	To trochę tłuste.
__label__pl	Wchodzisz czy nie?
__label__pl	Potrzebuję odpowiedzi.
__label__pl	Jestem tak samo ciekawy, jak ty.
__label__pl	Gratuluję wam!
__label__pl	Jesteśmy uzbrojeni.
__label__pl	Potrzebujesz samochodu?
__label__pl	Chyba jesteś szalony.
__label__pl	Ten mężczyzna jest stary.
__label__pl	Nie zgubiliśmy się.
__label__pl	Tom jest teraz zajęty.
__label__pl	Byłem wściekły.
__label__pl	Zatrzymaj to dla siebie!
__label__pl	On nie jest naszym wrogiem.
__label__pl	Kiedy odjeżdża twój pociąg?
__label__pl	Na koniec wygrałem.
__label__pl	Znikam.
__label__pl	Czuję gaz.
__label__pl	Tom zawsze przegrywa.
__label__pl	Nie bądź idiotą.
__label__pl	Czy jestem głupi?
__label__pl	Pachnie dobrze.
__label__pl	Kto to ma?
__label__pl	Okno jest zamknięte.
__label__pl	Było nam nudno.
__label__pl	Nasze zasoby są ograniczone.
__label__pl	Czuję się zestresowany.
__label__pl	Tom dobrze mnie zna.
__label__pl	Nie mogę ci tego dać.
__label__pl	Jaki masz problem?
__label__pl	Zaufaliśmy Tomowi.
__label__pl	Jak długo już palisz?
__label__pl	Nadal ją kocha.
__label__pl	Spróbujcie!
__label__pl	Jestem przyjacielem.
__label__pl	Tom nie jest naiwny.
__label__pl	W pobliżu mojej szkoły jest duży park.
__label__pl	Tom miał silne bóle.
__label__pl	On dobrze mówi po angielsku.
__label__pl	Tom pości.
__label__pl	Biorę go.
__label__pl	Kupuję kurtkę.
__label__pl	Koronawirus jest niebezpieczny.
__label__pl	Co to jest koronawirus?
__label__pl	Czy Tom jest wyleczony?
__label__pl	Zaryzykujemy.
__label__pl	Zaryzykuję.
__label__pl	Akceptuję ryzyko.
__label__pl	Mój stan zdrowia jest dobry.
__label__pl	Zdrowie jest wszystkim, czego chcę.
__label__pl	Czy cieszysz się dobrym zdrowiem?
__label__pl	Ona nienawidzi biegać.
__label__pl	Nic się nie stanie.
__label__pl	To się stanie.
__label__pl	To się stanie później.
__label__pl	Tom rzadko się uśmiechał.
__label__pl	Nasz nauczyciel rzadko się śmieje.
__label__pl	Umiem jeździć na rowerze.
__label__pl	Lubię jeździć na rowerze.
__label__pl	Tom nie umie jeździć na rowerze.
__label__pl	Tom był moim studentem.
__label__pl	Nie jesteśmy studentami.
__label__pl	Nie jesteś studentem.
__label__pl	Woda jest ważna.
__label__pl	Zmiana jest ważna.
__label__pl	Edukacja jest ważna.
__label__pl	Doświadczenie jest ważne.
__label__pl	To nie było ważne.
__label__pl	To było idealne.
__label__pl	To nie jest idealne.
__label__pl	To nie są idealne warunki.
__label__pl	To jest idealne.
__label__pl	Mamy pełnię księżyca.
__label__pl	Lubię opowieści.
__label__pl	Ona czeka.
__label__pl	Po co to zmieniać?
__label__pl	On rozwiązuje zadanie.
__label__pl	Oni mieli rację.
__label__pl	Książka jest po lewej stronie obok filiżanki.
__label__pl	Tom uwielbia makaron.
__label__pl	Czy często płaczesz?
__label__pl	Rzeka zalała cały region.
__label__pl	To dla mnie dobra wiadomość.
__label__pl	Nikt nie jest szczęśliwy.
__label__pl	To świetny pomysł!
__label__pl	Zrobiło się ciemno.
__label__pl	Ona jest bardzo mądra.
__label__pl	Czy ktoś za mną tęsknił?
__label__pl	Już więcej nie pamiętam.
__label__pl	To dostanie pan w drogerii.
__label__pl	On jest dobrym uczniem.
__label__pl	Oczywiście każdy chce wygrać.
__label__pl	Dlaczego Tom się ukrywa?
__label__pl	Potrzebny mi jest znaczek pocztowy.
__label__pl	Miałeś rację.
__label__pl	Wszyscy to wiedzieliśmy.
__label__pl	Co ty robisz tu w środku?
__label__pl	Tom wygrywa.
__label__pl	Czyja to torebka?
__label__pl	Tom nie miał jedzenia.
__label__pl	Musisz tu zostać.
__label__pl	Gdzie jest mój pokój?
__label__pl	Daj mi czas!
__label__pl	Czy to dobrze?
__label__pl	Tom nie pije czerwonego wina.
__label__pl	Ona niczego się nie boi.
__label__pl	Jesteś moim dzieckiem.
__label__pl	Chodźcie tu natychmiast!
__label__pl	Tak to zrobiłem.
__label__pl	Tom był całkiem uroczy.
__label__pl	Niedziela jest pierwszym dniem tygodnia.
__label__pl	Proszę przestań kłamać.
__label__pl	Czy dostarczacie w niedziele?
__label__pl	Nie chcę słyszeć żadnego sprzeciwu.
__label__pl	Ja wziąłem te pieniądze.
__label__pl	To wiadro przecieka.
__label__pl	To nie było moje.
__label__pl	Czy ten samochód jest nowy?
__label__pl	Tom lubi szympansy.
__label__pl	Kupiłem zegarek na rękę.
__label__pl	Jestem właścicielem tego samochodu.
__label__pl	Tutaj jesteś bezpieczniejszy.
__label__pl	Ja nie słucham.
__label__pl	Tom jest wytrwały.
__label__pl	Tom jest fantastyczny.
__label__pl	Nie jestem bogatym człowiekiem.
__label__pl	Zabiłeś Toma.
__label__pl	Muszę być pewien.
__label__pl	Czy pan to sprawdził?
__label__pl	To jest nieporęczne.
__label__pl	Tom mi zaufał.
__label__pl	Możesz na to odpowiedzieć.
__label__pl	Nie zaprzeczę temu.
__label__pl	Idziesz do szpitala.
__label__pl	O co chcesz mnie zapytać?
__label__pl	Czy może pan to otworzyć?
__label__pl	Powiedz coś!
__label__pl	Musicie odpocząć.
__label__pl	Spotkałem Toma niedawno.
__label__pl	Czy masz jabłka?
__label__pl	Zaprosiliście go?
__label__pl	Mam wielu krewnych.
__label__pl	Nie jestem zdrajcą.
__label__pl	Tom pił piwo.
__label__pl	Wchodzę w to!
__label__pl	Czy to jest wystarczająco duże?
__label__pl	Tęsknię za moimi przyjaciółmi.
__label__pl	Mam problemy z oddychaniem.
__label__pl	Jestem przekonany.
__label__pl	Tom jest nastolatkiem.
__label__pl	Uwielbiam ciasta.
__label__pl	Ona pływa w pieniądzach.
__label__pl	Chciałbym piwo.
__label__pl	Nikt cię nie kocha.
__label__pl	Marie ma pytanie.
__label__pl	Chcę więcej pieniędzy.
__label__pl	Mamy pecha.
__label__pl	Lubię przygodę.
__label__pl	Ta kawa jest słodka.
__label__pl	Może mogę pomóc.
__label__pl	Czy dostałeś coś do jedzenia?
__label__pl	Tom jeździ wolno.
__label__pl	Gram na gitarze.
__label__pl	Piekę chleb.
__label__pl	To jest amerykańskie.
__label__pl	Wszystko jest możliwe.
__label__pl	Będzie lepiej.
__label__pl	Tom był szczęśliwy.
__label__pl	Potrzebujesz pomocy.
__label__pl	Musisz przestać.
__label__pl	Chciałbym oglądać telewizję.
__label__pl	Tom jest pijany.
__label__pl	Tom kocha konie.
__label__pl	Byliśmy przyjaciółmi.
__label__pl	Bakterie są wszędzie.
__label__pl	Daj jej to!
__label__pl	Jest mi niedobrze.
__label__pl	To musi się skończyć.
__label__pl	Udowodnij mi to.
__label__pl	Czy powiedziałeś tak?
__label__pl	Muszę wracać.
__label__pl	To jest niepokojące.
__label__pl	Tom potrzebuje ubrań.
__label__pl	Własnie się kąpię.
__label__pl	Czy on przyjdzie?
__label__pl	Wszystko jest ważne.
__label__pl	Zrób to głośniej.
__label__pl	Kto to mówi?
__label__pl	Jesteśmy niecierpliwi.
__label__pl	Czy ma pan ryż?
__label__pl	On jest nieprzytomny.
__label__pl	Zostajesz tam.
__label__pl	Tom tęskni za domem.
__label__pl	Tom jest niespokojny.
__label__pl	Ona go chce.
__label__pl	Istnieją zasady.
__label__pl	Czy Tom omówił to z Marią?
__label__pl	Ptaki ćwierkają.
__label__pl	Nie znosimy się.
__label__pl	Gratuluję ci!
__label__pl	Czas jest przekroczony.
__label__pl	Uważam, że to jest godne zaufania.
__label__pl	Mam wino.
__label__pl	To było cudowne.
__label__pl	To jest inne.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy złodziejami.
__label__pl	Tom, Mary, John i Alice są złodziejami.
__label__pl	To jest kradzież.
__label__pl	Nie kradnę.
__label__pl	Złap piłkę.
__label__pl	Ja tylko żartowałem.
__label__pl	Teraz wszystko do siebie pasuje!
__label__pl	Bardzo lubię się targować.
__label__pl	Pozwól mi zadzwonić do Toma.
__label__pl	Będę uciekać.
__label__pl	Jestem nauczycielem geografii.
__label__pl	Mój przyjaciel był w grupie aktorskiej.
__label__pl	To jest zbyt wątpliwe.
__label__pl	Pojechałem na wieś.
__label__pl	Zapamiętam to sobie.
__label__pl	Muszę sobie umyć włosy.
__label__pl	Jesteś pięknością.
__label__pl	Nie możesz mi tego zrobić.
__label__pl	Czy potrzebujemy specjalnego zezwolenia?
__label__pl	Kto jest z państwem?
__label__pl	Czy Tom pracował dla pana?
__label__pl	Czy to było przerażające?
__label__pl	Strasznie zazdroszczę tym ludziom.
__label__pl	Panowała niesamowita cisza.
__label__pl	Zapomniał pan zamknąć drzwi.
__label__pl	Czy możemy zakończyć ten incydent?
__label__pl	Przejmuję Toma.
__label__pl	Słuchawka prysznicowa jest złamana.
__label__pl	Mamy różne poglądy.
__label__pl	Czy mam to przepołowić?
__label__pl	Można zetrzeć ser lub pomidory na tarce.
__label__pl	Skórka jest chrupiąca.
__label__pl	Tom jest słabeuszem.
__label__pl	Uwielbiam gotować.
__label__pl	Byłem tam.
__label__pl	Coś wydaje się być nie tak.
__label__pl	Nie możemy wygrać.
__label__pl	Dzwoniłem do ciebie dziś po południu.
__label__pl	Potrzebujesz tego.
__label__pl	To należy do niego.
__label__pl	Czego szukacie?
__label__pl	Ubierz ją.
__label__pl	Nie mogłem przestać.
__label__pl	Czy jest pan zły?
__label__pl	To wygląda tak prawdziwie.
__label__pl	Wszyscy ufają Tomowi.
__label__pl	Odwiedźmy Toma!
__label__pl	Nikt jej nie lubi.
__label__pl	Byłem zniechęcony.
__label__pl	Była w depresji.
__label__pl	On jest rannym ptaszkiem.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy braćmi.
__label__pl	Ona jest bogata.
__label__pl	On jest niekompetentny.
__label__pl	To jest śmieszne.
__label__pl	To jest podłe!
__label__pl	Nic nie widziałem.
__label__pl	Widzę to.
__label__pl	Skończyliśmy?
__label__pl	Nie mam siły, aby próbować dalej.
__label__pl	Wasza kolej.
__label__pl	Znowu się spóźniliście.
__label__pl	Jesteście zupełnie sami?
__label__pl	Nie jesteście zajęci?
__label__pl	Jesteście jeszcze głodni?
__label__pl	Dlaczego jesteście w domu?
__label__pl	Jesteście z policji?
__label__pl	Jesteście uzbrojeni?
__label__pl	Jesteście pod wrażeniem?
__label__pl	Nie wyszliście?
__label__pl	Leżałem.
__label__pl	Gdzie ją położyłeś?
__label__pl	Muszę się położyć.
__label__pl	Ilu Państwa jest? 3 osoby.
__label__pl	Niech pan otworzy te drzwi.
__label__pl	Czy piszesz listy miłosne?
__label__pl	Kupuję zmywarkę.
__label__pl	To mogłoby się zepsuć.
__label__pl	Oni nie mogą wejść.
__label__pl	Głodujemy.
__label__pl	Czy to jest przesolone?
__label__pl	Tom pali.
__label__pl	Tom drży.
__label__pl	Opuściłem moją żonę.
__label__pl	Ta strona internetowa jest niedostępna.
__label__pl	Ta herbata smakuje dobrze.
__label__pl	Tom pracuje powoli.
__label__pl	Czy Tom zemdlał?
__label__pl	On kupuje okulary.
__label__pl	My cię znamy.
__label__pl	Oddzwonię do ciebie.
__label__pl	Jestem żądny przygód.
__label__pl	Uratował mi pan życie.
__label__pl	Oni uratowali mi życie.
__label__pl	Są bardzo słodkie.
__label__pl	Czy Tom tam jest?
__label__pl	Dostałem nowy aparat fotograficzny.
__label__pl	Nic ci nie jestem winien.
__label__pl	Tom jest zajęty.
__label__pl	Pokój jest przestronny i jasny.
__label__pl	Ukryj pieniądze!
__label__pl	Odwiedzili nas.
__label__pl	Tom jest skazańcem.
__label__pl	Byłem jedynym mężczyzną.
__label__pl	A ja?
__label__pl	To jest część planu.
__label__pl	To jest niezapomniane.
__label__pl	Jesteś nadęty.
__label__pl	Gdzie jest twoja rodzina?
__label__pl	To takie proste.
__label__pl	Tom nienawidzi marchewki.
__label__pl	Ona jest agresywna.
__label__pl	Niech pan wezwie lekarza.
__label__pl	Gąbka wchłania wodę.
__label__pl	Ten zakład przegrałem.
__label__pl	Czy jestem ci winien pieniądze?
__label__pl	Przyjadę samochodem.
__label__pl	To nie jest żart!
__label__pl	Nie potrzebujemy pana.
__label__pl	Teraz nienawidzę Toma.
__label__pl	Twarz Toma jest czerwona.
__label__pl	Nie mogę teraz o tym rozmawiać.
__label__pl	Nie przegramy.
__label__pl	Przynieś mi moją skrzynkę narzędziową.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy otoczeni!
__label__pl	Mamy długą drogę za sobą.
__label__pl	Tom jest ateistą.
__label__pl	Mam suchą skórę.
__label__pl	Mój kot lubi mleko.
__label__pl	Nadal żyję.
__label__pl	Musicie iść.
__label__pl	Zajmiemy się tym.
__label__pl	Tom ma nową pracę.
__label__pl	Nie ma nadziei.
__label__pl	Mam nadzieję, że to zadziała.
__label__pl	Ta spódnica jest dla mnie za szeroka.
__label__pl	Ona jest atrakcyjna.
__label__pl	Powiedziałeś trzydzieści?
__label__pl	Znasz tych ludzi.
__label__pl	Jest nowy dzień.
__label__pl	Powinieneś jeść warzywa.
__label__pl	Podoba mi się moja praca.
__label__pl	Szukam samochodu.
__label__pl	Lubisz Mozarta?
__label__pl	Nie będę w stanie ci pomóc.
__label__pl	Każdy kocha lalki.
__label__pl	Kupuję różę.
__label__pl	Gdzie jest haczyk?
__label__pl	Idę sam.
__label__pl	Z jakiego powodu tam byłeś?
__label__pl	Będę spał na kanapie.
__label__pl	Czy jadł pan już obiad?
__label__pl	Pozwól mi zmierzyć twoją temperaturę.
__label__pl	Marzyłem.
__label__pl	To było skomplikowane.
__label__pl	Czekamy na odlot.
__label__pl	Nie mamy już czerwonego wina.
__label__pl	Oni dużo piją.
__label__pl	Byłem wzruszony.
__label__pl	To wygląda bardzo smacznie.
__label__pl	Tom spojrzał w górę.
__label__pl	Proszę bądź cierpliwy!
__label__pl	To tylko pieniądze.
__label__pl	Chcę to zrobić jeszcze raz.
__label__pl	Co my tu mamy?
__label__pl	Strzelamy.
__label__pl	Były idealne.
__label__pl	Czy w domu jest pralka?
__label__pl	To jest kura.
__label__pl	Nie będę tego nosić.
__label__pl	Mówię przez sen.
__label__pl	Nie jesteś martwy.
__label__pl	Możemy porozmawiać o tym później.
__label__pl	Czy Tom zjadł coś na kolację?
__label__pl	Daj mi swój telefon!
__label__pl	Tom kocha dzieci.
__label__pl	Wołamy cię.
__label__pl	On jest urzędnikiem.
__label__pl	Jestem więźniem.
__label__pl	Pójdę w niedzielę.
__label__pl	To jest sprzeczność.
__label__pl	My płacimy.
__label__pl	To było bardzo łatwe.
__label__pl	Potrzebuję czegoś jadalnego.
__label__pl	Kupiłem zegarek.
__label__pl	Nie jesteście bliźniakami.
__label__pl	Nie lekceważ tego.
__label__pl	Odbiorę cię.
__label__pl	Czy pan to wiedział?
__label__pl	Tom przyszedł trzy minuty wcześniej.
__label__pl	Dużo mówię.
__label__pl	On pisze list.
__label__pl	To nie może być prawdziwy diament.
__label__pl	Mógłbym ci pomóc?
__label__pl	Nie umiała pływać.
__label__pl	Kim są pozostali?
__label__pl	Tak gotuje się ryż.
__label__pl	Czy jesteś godny zaufania?
__label__pl	Być może ona nie przyjdzie.
__label__pl	Tom jest cierpliwy.
__label__pl	Kocham ten las.
__label__pl	Chodź natychmiast do domu.
__label__pl	Czy Tom tu przyszedł?
__label__pl	Spróbuj teraz spać!
__label__pl	Czy to jest nowe?
__label__pl	Nie będę cię okłamywać.
__label__pl	Tom pójdzie.
__label__pl	Jem fasolę.
__label__pl	Dlaczego uciekłeś?
__label__pl	Uczę francuskiego.
__label__pl	Już się spotkaliśmy.
__label__pl	Czy Tom już dzwonił?
__label__pl	To było bezbolesne.
__label__pl	To jest żart.
__label__pl	Gdzie mogę zaparkować?
__label__pl	Jak to się skończy?
__label__pl	Należy do mojego brata.
__label__pl	Ma trzech synów.
__label__pl	Widziałem już dość.
__label__pl	Co to jest odleżyna i jak się powstaje?
__label__pl	Potrzebuję wsparcia.
__label__pl	Niech pan wspiera Toma!
__label__pl	Wspieraj Toma!
__label__pl	Potrzebuję odrobinę wsparcia.
__label__pl	Gdzie mogę odłożyć moją torbę?
__label__pl	Boli mnie klatka piersiowa.
__label__pl	Mam bóle w klatce piersiowej.
__label__pl	Można zapobiec chorobie.
__label__pl	Że co?
__label__pl	Kiedy jesteś na zjeździe dalekich krewnych, nie czujesz się jak w domu.
__label__pl	Kapitan kazał swoim ludziom natychmiast się zebrać.
__label__pl	Miał ich na oku. / Pilnował ich.
__label__pl	Dużo przeklina, gdy jest wkurzony.
__label__pl	Chcesz go?
__label__pl	Komórki tworzą tkankę.
__label__pl	Istnieje wiele czynników.
__label__pl	Wykształcenie jest ważnym czynnikiem.
__label__pl	Maria chce przebudować swoją kuchnię.
__label__pl	Nauczycielka dała mi najdłuższy rozdział.
__label__pl	Przeczytałem tylko cztery pierwsze rozdziały.
__label__pl	Dzisiaj zostaję w domu.
__label__pl	Przeczytaj to najpierw!
__label__pl	Co powiemy Tomowi?
__label__pl	Na obiad zjadłem hot doga.
__label__pl	Jest dopiero trzecia.
__label__pl	Kot jest w fontannie.
__label__pl	Czy jestem tu bezpieczny?
__label__pl	Tutaj jest bezpiecznie.
__label__pl	Tutaj jesteś bezpieczny.
__label__pl	Jestem całkiem pewny.
__label__pl	Tu nie jest bezpiecznie.
__label__pl	Nie bądź zbyt pewny!
__label__pl	Jestem pewien mojej sprawy.
__label__pl	Nie mogę powiedzieć tego na pewno.
__label__pl	Jestem w kłopotach.
__label__pl	Ten dom jest dobrze izolowany.
__label__pl	To jest zbyt trudne.
__label__pl	Daj mi tą łyżkę.
__label__pl	Może ceny się zmienią.
__label__pl	Stanie się to wcześniej czy później.
__label__pl	Mamy siebie.
__label__pl	Było bardzo wietrznie.
__label__pl	Tom lubi wszystkich i wszyscy lubią Toma.
__label__pl	On idzie do szkoły.
__label__pl	Tom jest bardzo skąpy.
__label__pl	On jest trochę skąpy.
__label__pl	Czas wstawać!
__label__pl	Pływanie sprawiło mi radość.
__label__pl	Oni się mylą.
__label__pl	Nienawidzę chłodnych zimowych dni.
__label__pl	Zrobię ci kawę.
__label__pl	Czy masz głęboki talerz na zupę?
__label__pl	On jedzie windą.
__label__pl	Możemy się spotkać.
__label__pl	Czy Tom wybrał?
__label__pl	Czy to się nadaje?
__label__pl	Dzięki za mleko!
__label__pl	On ciągle czyta.
__label__pl	Potrafię przejrzeć twoje kłamstwa.
__label__pl	Widzisz kogoś?
__label__pl	Na to nie mam odpowiedzi.
__label__pl	Śmierdzą.
__label__pl	Czy dotarł?
__label__pl	Wiesz, gdzie jesteśmy?
__label__pl	Oboje ogłosili swoje zaręczyny.
__label__pl	Żaden z niego nauczyciel.
__label__pl	Żaden z niego artysta.
__label__pl	Lepiej jest zostać w środku niż wychodzić na zewnątrz.
__label__pl	Wiele dzieciaków nosi ten typ kapelusza.
__label__pl	Jack zdaje się mocno tego żałować.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary założyli narty.
__label__pl	Miejmy nadzieję, że następny sezon jest lepszy.
__label__pl	Nie lubię amerykańskiej muzyki.
__label__pl	Algeria i Wenezuela są krajami bogatymi w ropę.
__label__pl	Ona jest życzliwą czarownicą.
__label__pl	Tom często pożycza pieniądze od swoich przyjaciół.
__label__pl	Wydaje się, że Tom powiedział prawdę.
__label__pl	Kiedy ostatni raz miałeś częste zawroty głowy?
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że kupiłby trochę znaczków.
__label__pl	Dobrze powiedziane.
__label__pl	Tom nie był pewny jak ma postępować.
__label__pl	Ludzie zaczynają się przyglądać.
__label__pl	Przynieś to tutaj.
__label__pl	Otwórzmy okno!
__label__pl	Potrzebujemy darowizn.
__label__pl	Musiałem pracować.
__label__pl	Medytuję.
__label__pl	Co ci powiedziano?
__label__pl	Dzwoniła żona Toma.
__label__pl	Ma około czterdziestu lat.
__label__pl	Potrzebuję tych pieniędzy.
__label__pl	Nadal pada deszcz.
__label__pl	Dobrze dla ciebie.
__label__pl	Następne dostaniemy my.
__label__pl	Teraz przejmujesz ty.
__label__pl	Studiuję psychologię.
__label__pl	Tom coś wiedział.
__label__pl	Odłóż to pudełko.
__label__pl	Wiatr zawył.
__label__pl	Będziemy za panem tęsknić.
__label__pl	Co jestem winien Tomowi?
__label__pl	Nie pomyliłeś się.
__label__pl	Daj Tomowi coś do jedzenia.
__label__pl	Widziałem go znowu.
__label__pl	Wyprowadzam się z Bostonu.
__label__pl	Ona go jeszcze nigdy nie widziała.
__label__pl	Mówię nie.
__label__pl	Cieszę się z tego.
__label__pl	Wszyscy mnie nienawidzą.
__label__pl	Zjadłem banana.
__label__pl	Jem powoli.
__label__pl	Oni czekają na moją odpowiedź.
__label__pl	Czekają na moją odpowiedź.
__label__pl	Ona go nastraszyła.
__label__pl	Lód pęknie pod twoim ciężarem.
__label__pl	To jest trochę tłuste.
__label__pl	To jest na pewno zabawne.
__label__pl	Tom jest naszym klientem.
__label__pl	Kto jest na diecie?
__label__pl	Mam dopiero trzynaście lat.
__label__pl	Kto ją ma?
__label__pl	Czy macie córki?
__label__pl	Tom lubi oliwki.
__label__pl	Kto krzyczał?
__label__pl	Szukam pana.
__label__pl	On szuka naszego samochodu.
__label__pl	Impreza się skończyła.
__label__pl	Możecie wejść.
__label__pl	To będzie ubaw!
__label__pl	Gdzie jest mój pierścionek?
__label__pl	Będę sam.
__label__pl	Pojechałem do Poczdamu.
__label__pl	Czy masz papier?
__label__pl	To jest czasochłonne.
__label__pl	Czy jest pan emeryturze?
__label__pl	To musi wystarczyć.
__label__pl	Miłość jest skomplikowana.
__label__pl	Moja mama mnie kocha.
__label__pl	Byłem uprzejmy.
__label__pl	Czy to bardzo boli?
__label__pl	Tom doił krowę.
__label__pl	Czy czujesz się lepiej?
__label__pl	Uprawiamy tutaj pszenicę.
__label__pl	Tom był znudzony.
__label__pl	Znam dobrze Boston.
__label__pl	Tom daje lekcje jogi.
__label__pl	To pomaga.
__label__pl	Jest pan dobrym kucharzem.
__label__pl	Uwielbiam czosnek.
__label__pl	Zaraz zrobimy przerwę.
__label__pl	Jest przejrzyste.
__label__pl	Przygotuj się do spania!
__label__pl	Jestem przygnębiony.
__label__pl	Jest bardzo ciemno.
__label__pl	Próbowaliśmy.
__label__pl	Gdzie jest moja żona?
__label__pl	Nigdy więcej jej nie zobaczę.
__label__pl	Jestem sławny.
__label__pl	Tom gra w brydża.
__label__pl	Wieżowiec się pali.
__label__pl	Było za późno.
__label__pl	Pan musi to dla mnie zrobić.
__label__pl	Potrzebuję hydraulika.
__label__pl	Tom jest zły.
__label__pl	To może być zabawne.
__label__pl	Lubię wyścigi konne.
__label__pl	Tom wydawał się wściekły.
__label__pl	Tom to zrozumie.
__label__pl	Tom spadł ze schodów.
__label__pl	Są zimne.
__label__pl	Potrzebujemy więcej czasu.
__label__pl	Kupujemy samochód.
__label__pl	Spóźniają się.
__label__pl	Ma pięć uderzeń serca na minutę.
__label__pl	Chodźcie do pokoju.
__label__pl	Zatrudniliśmy Toma.
__label__pl	Tom jest przygnębiony.
__label__pl	Chciałbym po prostu wygrać.
__label__pl	Nie obawiaj się!
__label__pl	Czekam na kolację.
__label__pl	Weź swoje tabletki!
__label__pl	Na razie cieszę się, że mam z kim iść.
__label__pl	Czy mogę trochę odpocząć?
__label__pl	Zrobiłem pierwszy krok.
__label__pl	Chyba nie pomogłem.
__label__pl	Tom mi to powiedział.
__label__pl	Chcę odzyskać mój klucz.
__label__pl	Chcesz się poddać?
__label__pl	Tom nie miał alibi.
__label__pl	Tom stoi.
__label__pl	Miałem operację biodra w 2013 roku.
__label__pl	On jest bardzo szczery.
__label__pl	Prawie nie znam Toma.
__label__pl	Czy jest jakaś wiadomość?
__label__pl	Dlaczego miałbym się śmiać?
__label__pl	Nie możemy.
__label__pl	Gdzie chciałbyś mieszkać?
__label__pl	Wyglądam jak Tom.
__label__pl	Zacznijmy tutaj!
__label__pl	Czy masz nadwagę?
__label__pl	Czekam na jedzenie.
__label__pl	Tom się ubrał.
__label__pl	Sprawdziliście to?
__label__pl	Nienawidzę pracy.
__label__pl	Przestań do mnie pisać.
__label__pl	Tom też to widział.
__label__pl	Uwielbiam ten film.
__label__pl	Nie chcę dzisiaj iść.
__label__pl	Tę pracę zostawiam tobie.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy uratowani.
__label__pl	Hurra!
__label__pl	Będzie coraz gorzej.
__label__pl	Dom był duży.
__label__pl	Do licha!
__label__pl	Jestem w dobrym nastroju.
__label__pl	Bracia!
__label__pl	Jestem mocno przeziębiony.
__label__pl	Hamuj.
__label__pl	Pobierzmy się.
__label__pl	Czyżby?
__label__pl	Pewnie.
__label__pl	Biedactwo!
__label__pl	Mam jeszcze więcej.
__label__pl	Tom się nie przedstawił.
__label__pl	Wiedzieliśmy wystarczająco.
__label__pl	Chciałbym siedzieć przy oknie.
__label__pl	Tom chyba przyjdzie.
__label__pl	Oni mnie kochają.
__label__pl	Przeczytałeś ją?
__label__pl	Dlaczego chcesz to zrobić?
__label__pl	Marzenie się spełniło
__label__pl	Nagle zahamowałem.
__label__pl	Nic nie możemy dla ciebie zrobić.
__label__pl	Przyjedziemy.
__label__pl	Tom śpiewa.
__label__pl	Tom myśli.
__label__pl	Tom płacze.
__label__pl	Tom wyje.
__label__pl	Tom oddycha.
__label__pl	Tom drzemie.
__label__pl	Tom gwiżdże.
__label__pl	Tom krzyczy.
__label__pl	Znikamy.
__label__pl	Czy on przyszedł?
__label__pl	Iść dalej!
__label__pl	Jechać dalej!
__label__pl	Łap!
__label__pl	Weźcie.
__label__pl	Naprzód.
__label__pl	Zmiana tematu!
__label__pl	Studiujesz?
__label__pl	Słyszę.
__label__pl	Przychodzicie.
__label__pl	Nadchodzi.
__label__pl	Szukają.
__label__pl	Wszyscy czekają.
__label__pl	Wszyscy mówią.
__label__pl	Nie krzycz!
__label__pl	Błyszczy się.
__label__pl	Współpracuję.
__label__pl	Toniemy?
__label__pl	Uśmiechasz się?
__label__pl	Jazda autobusem trwa.
__label__pl	On czeka.
__label__pl	Czy ty uczysz?
__label__pl	Kop szybciej.
__label__pl	Ucz się więcej.
__label__pl	Oszukał.
__label__pl	Tańczą.
__label__pl	Oni tańczą.
__label__pl	Pobiegła.
__label__pl	Idź wziąć prysznic!
__label__pl	Tom żyje.
__label__pl	Wszystko działa.
__label__pl	Pływanie zabronione!
__label__pl	Kąpiel zabroniona!
__label__pl	Naciśnij na to.
__label__pl	Spójrz w dół.
__label__pl	Tom malował.
__label__pl	Tom marzył.
__label__pl	Tom pisał.
__label__pl	Idziecie.
__label__pl	Idziesz.
__label__pl	Chwyciłem linę aby nie upaść.
__label__pl	Minęło wiele czasu odkąd miałem taką przyjemną niespodziankę.
__label__pl	Czy już postawiłeś choinkę?
__label__pl	Będę się kontaktował jeżeli będę miał więcej putań.
__label__pl	Z powodu braku uczestników musieliśmy odroczyć zgromadzenie ogólne.
__label__pl	Nie potrzebuję zajęcia.
__label__pl	Zawsze chodź na pogrzeby innych bo inaczej oni nie przyjdą na twój.
__label__pl	Tom wcale cię bardzo nie lubi
__label__pl	Tom może tu usiąść.
__label__pl	Tom boi się że może być zwolniony (z pracy).
__label__pl	Mieszka na peryferiach Algieru.
__label__pl	Czy Tom może nie mieć racji?
__label__pl	Tom powinien być nauczycielem.
__label__pl	Pies nazywa się Ken.
__label__pl	Wszystko wydaje się iść dobrze.
__label__pl	Proszę nie palić za dużo.
__label__pl	Nudny wykład profesora usypiał mnie.
__label__pl	Wstyd!
__label__pl	Pięknie.
__label__pl	Przyjemnie.
__label__pl	Kto zniknął?
__label__pl	Zostajemy.
__label__pl	Ja wiem!
__label__pl	Płacisz?
__label__pl	Bez paniki.
__label__pl	Jedzą.
__label__pl	Okropnie!
__label__pl	Ekstremalnie!
__label__pl	Eureka!
__label__pl	Spoko!
__label__pl	Tom kicha.
__label__pl	Tom tonie!
__label__pl	Tom żartuje.
__label__pl	Tom pakuje.
__label__pl	Zjedzcie wszystko.
__label__pl	Pracujemy.
__label__pl	Słyszymy!
__label__pl	Obudź Toma!
__label__pl	Bardzo chętnie.
__label__pl	Wolałbym umrzeć.
__label__pl	Wolałbym popływać.
__label__pl	To taki piękny kwiat.
__label__pl	To taki miły dzień.
__label__pl	On jest nieprzewidywalny.
__label__pl	Życie jest nieprzewidywalne.
__label__pl	Esperanto jest łatwiejsze.
__label__pl	To jest o wiele łatwiejsze.
__label__pl	Kwestia opinii.
__label__pl	To jest miejska legenda.
__label__pl	Jest wiele legend w Japonii.
__label__pl	Wsiadaj!
__label__pl	Przyjdź koniecznie!
__label__pl	Do pełna, proszę.
__label__pl	Popatrz tam!
__label__pl	Kłamiesz.
__label__pl	Podpisz tutaj.
__label__pl	Czy to działa?
__label__pl	Zejdź na dół!
__label__pl	Oni kłamią!
__label__pl	Oglądasz?
__label__pl	Żartujemy.
__label__pl	Zaczekaj chwilkę!
__label__pl	Czy to pomaga?
__label__pl	Czy Tom przychodzi?
__label__pl	Nie kłam!
__label__pl	Drżałem.
__label__pl	Umyj wszystko!
__label__pl	Pomóżcie mi!
__label__pl	Kto weźmie udział?
__label__pl	Tom weźmie udział.
__label__pl	Zmarł niedawno.
__label__pl	Ostatnio widziałem Jamesa.
__label__pl	Miłość przychodzi od miłości, gdy chcę by mnie kochano powinienem pokochać pierwszy.
__label__pl	Miłość jest owocem miłości, gdy chcesz by cię pokochano pokochaj pierwszy
__label__pl	Tom musiał zrobić objazd.
__label__pl	Tom musiał wykonać objazd.
__label__pl	Nie podoba mi się to co powiedziałeś o Tomie.
__label__pl	Tom nie mógł cię słyszeć.
__label__pl	Byłem smutny gdy odeszła.
__label__pl	Myślę, że powinieneś powiedzieć Mary to co chce wiedzieć.
__label__pl	Uważam, że powinieneś powiedzieć Mary to co chce wiedzieć.
__label__pl	Pojawiła się w szkole punktualnie mimo śnieżycy.
__label__pl	Nigdy mi się nie przydarzyło by Tom nie przyszedł.
__label__pl	Morze jest gniewne.
__label__pl	Morze się gniewa.
__label__pl	Kiedy zaczynasz odprawę?
__label__pl	O mojej matce mówi się, że była piękna gdy była dziewczynką.
__label__pl	O mojej matce mówi się, że będąc dziewczynką była piękna.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary mówili po francusku stąd nie wiedziałem o czym rozmawiali.
__label__pl	To prawda co powiedziałeś.
__label__pl	To prawda coś powiedział.
__label__pl	To prawda co powiedziałaś.
__label__pl	To co powiedziałeś jest prawdą.
__label__pl	To co powiedziałaś jest prawdą.
__label__pl	Człowiek jest niewolnikiem zwyczajów.
__label__pl	Człowiek jest niewolnikiem przyzwyczajeń.
__label__pl	Minęło dwadzieścia lat odkąd się pobrali.
__label__pl	Jeżeli ja im nie powiem to to to zrobi?
__label__pl	To tylko jeszcze bardziej komplikuje sprawę.
__label__pl	Osobowość Toma zmienia się, gdy łapie za mikrofon.
__label__pl	Nasz oddział zaatakował wroga.
__label__pl	Broń się!
__label__pl	Jemy.
__label__pl	Czy Tom świętuje?
__label__pl	Łamie się!
__label__pl	Zaprzeczasz?
__label__pl	Czy pan zaprzecza?
__label__pl	Bez obaw!
__label__pl	Świętujemy.
__label__pl	Tom gotuje.
__label__pl	Tom krwawi.
__label__pl	Zajmij Toma.
__label__pl	Tom oślepł.
__label__pl	Ach tak.
__label__pl	Bądź pewny siebie!
__label__pl	Działa?
__label__pl	Skłamała.
__label__pl	Bądźcie dzielni!
__label__pl	Prowadź!
__label__pl	Improwizowałem.
__label__pl	Tom jest początkującym.
__label__pl	On sprzedaje napoje.
__label__pl	Chcę zajrzeć do środka.
__label__pl	Wędkowanie to przyjemność.
__label__pl	Chcę przyjść.
__label__pl	Czy jesteś piosenkarzem?
__label__pl	Przyprowadź Toma.
__label__pl	Chcesz sałatki?
__label__pl	Nie róbcie tego!
__label__pl	Nazywam się Tom.
__label__pl	Tom lubi lody waniliowe.
__label__pl	Tom jest szczęśliwy.
__label__pl	Byłem w pracy.
__label__pl	Czy to twoje?
__label__pl	Pobraliśmy się.
__label__pl	Ciągle się kłócimy.
__label__pl	Mamy gości.
__label__pl	Mieszkamy razem.
__label__pl	Potrzebujemy pomocy.
__label__pl	Powinniśmy byli iść.
__label__pl	Pracujemy razem.
__label__pl	To jest fantastyczne!
__label__pl	Jesteśmy sami.
__label__pl	Wszyscy są zszokowani.
__label__pl	Szukam kogoś.
__label__pl	Maria cię lubi.
__label__pl	Proszę nie odchodź!
__label__pl	Nie powtarzaj tego!
__label__pl	Czy mrówki mają uszy?
__label__pl	Może pan chodzić?
__label__pl	Las się pali.
__label__pl	Czy on ma tatuaże?
__label__pl	Czy ona ma tatuaże?
__label__pl	Czy macie koce?
__label__pl	Nakarmcie ptaki!
__label__pl	Pana kolej.
__label__pl	Czy masz ryż?
__label__pl	Lubią jabłka.
__label__pl	Woda jest mokra.
__label__pl	Udanej pracy ślicznotki!
__label__pl	Niech będzie choćby późno a pomyślnie.
__label__pl	Zraniłem się w ramię.
__label__pl	Włosy sięgają jej do ramion.
__label__pl	To jest mój kuzyn.
__label__pl	Tom wycelował.
__label__pl	Nic nie obiecuj!
__label__pl	Tom zamilkł.
__label__pl	Tom chichocze.
__label__pl	Czy Thomas żartuje?
__label__pl	Nie ufaj nikomu!
__label__pl	Jecie.
__label__pl	Tom odszedł z pracy.
__label__pl	Nie przerywaj!
__label__pl	Proszę śpiewaj.
__label__pl	Cały czas prosto!
__label__pl	Bądź tolerancyjny.
__label__pl	Zapomnijcie.
__label__pl	Wahałem się.
__label__pl	Proszę iść dalej!
__label__pl	Już dobrze.
__label__pl	Obserwuję.
__label__pl	Pływam.
__label__pl	Oni czekają.
__label__pl	Wypij swoje mleko.
__label__pl	Co ja mam?
__label__pl	On mieszka sam.
__label__pl	Jakie rozczarowujące!
__label__pl	Ty szukasz.
__label__pl	On szuka.
__label__pl	Ona szuka.
__label__pl	Wy szukacie.
__label__pl	Ona widzi.
__label__pl	Oni widzą.
__label__pl	Wy widzicie.
__label__pl	Ona przychodzi.
__label__pl	Nie bądź głupi!
__label__pl	Nie bądźcie głupi!
__label__pl	Jesteś nauczycielką.
__label__pl	Umieram z pragnienia.
__label__pl	Proszę płacić.
__label__pl	Weź aspirynę.
__label__pl	Tom się modli.
__label__pl	Tom się jąka.
__label__pl	Tom dowcipkuje.
__label__pl	Proszę zapiąć pasy!
__label__pl	Zaniechaj tego!
__label__pl	Nie ustępować!
__label__pl	Nie ma o czym rozmawiać!
__label__pl	Kłamiecie.
__label__pl	Wy kłamiecie.
__label__pl	Wszystko płacze.
__label__pl	Jest Boże Narodzenie.
__label__pl	Tom chce się bawić.
__label__pl	Czy chciałby pan śniadanie?
__label__pl	Obiecuję.
__label__pl	Denerwuję cię?
__label__pl	Uwielbiam spacery po lesie.
__label__pl	Zepsuło się.
__label__pl	Umrę.
__label__pl	Jest białe.
__label__pl	Boli mnie ucho.
__label__pl	Jest biała.
__label__pl	Tom jeszcze śpi.
__label__pl	Pamiętam.
__label__pl	Tom uszczypnął Mary.
__label__pl	Jakbym tego nie wiedział!
__label__pl	Umieram z pragnienia. Daj mi wody!
__label__pl	To jabłko jest zielone.
__label__pl	Tomasz śpiewa.
__label__pl	Jabłko jest zielone.
__label__pl	Jakże piękne jesteście!
__label__pl	Złe drzewo wydaje złe owoce.
__label__pl	Jesteś śpiąca czy zmęczona?
__label__pl	Torturowałem więźniów.
__label__pl	W moim mieście jest dobre muzeum.
__label__pl	Maria pocałowała swoją kotkę.
__label__pl	Dzisiaj nie możesz spotkać się z Tomaszem.
__label__pl	Czy jesteś prawnikiem?
__label__pl	Jej głos wybrzmiewał w korytarzu.
__label__pl	Jestem stary, ale nie aż tak.
__label__pl	Jestem młody, ale nie aż tak.
__label__pl	Bardzo dobrze mi płacisz.
__label__pl	To sprawi, że zyskamy na czasie.
__label__pl	Wrócę o 14:30.
__label__pl	Nie potrzebuję twojej pomocy, ale za to ty potrzebujesz mojej.
__label__pl	Jestem zajęty pracą domową.
__label__pl	Lepiej to zostaw.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary są zachwyceni japońskim anime.
__label__pl	Tom jest zachwycony japońskim anime i mangą.
__label__pl	Mary jest zachwycona niemiecką muzyką.
__label__pl	Chodź sam.
__label__pl	Pan prowadzi.
__label__pl	Oni jadą.
__label__pl	Tom zagwizdał.
__label__pl	Tom zaprotestował.
__label__pl	Tom protestował.
__label__pl	Bądźcie obiektywni.
__label__pl	Paliło się.
__label__pl	Spaliło się.
__label__pl	Śmierdzicie.
__label__pl	Nie kłóć się.
__label__pl	Idźcie na spacer!
__label__pl	Nie odbiegaj od tematu.
__label__pl	Smakuje?
__label__pl	Milczeli.
__label__pl	Mimo to dziękuję.
__label__pl	Ktoś śpiewa.
__label__pl	Nic dziwnego!
__label__pl	Zrób to.
__label__pl	Dziękuję za to.
__label__pl	Podziel to na akapity.
__label__pl	Napije się pan?
__label__pl	Pobiegłem.
__label__pl	Pozwoli pan?
__label__pl	Pozwala pan?
__label__pl	Chrapię.
__label__pl	Wariuję.
__label__pl	Coś przeciwko?
__label__pl	Kto się śmieje?
__label__pl	On jeździ na rolkach.
__label__pl	Dobrze pogryźć!
__label__pl	Rumienisz się?
__label__pl	Pan się rumieni?
__label__pl	Rumienicie się?
__label__pl	Nikt nie oszukiwał.
__label__pl	Przyjdź mnie odwiedzić.
__label__pl	Usiądźcie.
__label__pl	Kto idzie?
__label__pl	Walczymy.
__label__pl	Pościmy.
__label__pl	Kto pości?
__label__pl	Umieramy.
__label__pl	Tonę.
__label__pl	Tom współpracuje.
__label__pl	Tańczymy.
__label__pl	Współpracujemy.
__label__pl	Tom przychodzi.
__label__pl	Naprawdę zabawne.
__label__pl	Skontroluj ją.
__label__pl	Ktoś je.
__label__pl	Oni przychodzą.
__label__pl	Zawróć!
__label__pl	Śpiewaj proszę!
__label__pl	Tak się dzieje!
__label__pl	Medytujemy.
__label__pl	Byłem zmieszany.
__label__pl	Byłem gotowy.
__label__pl	Tom pobiegnie.
__label__pl	Tom właśnie wygrywa.
__label__pl	Będziemy pracować.
__label__pl	Tom będzie pracował.
__label__pl	Będziemy biegać.
__label__pl	Właśnie rozmawiam.
__label__pl	Tom poddał się?
__label__pl	Tom zacznie.
__label__pl	Tom zaczyna.
__label__pl	Tom umrze z głodu.
__label__pl	Zaczynamy.
__label__pl	Kto zacznie?
__label__pl	Będziemy zaczynać.
__label__pl	Odwrócił się.
__label__pl	Nie patrzeć!
__label__pl	Masz bzika.
__label__pl	No dobra!
__label__pl	Przyszliśmy tutaj, aby cię zobaczyć.
__label__pl	Każdego ranka słońce śmiało się przez okno.
__label__pl	Chciałby pan wejść i napić się filiżankę kawy?
__label__pl	Ta fabryka produkuje co miesiąc tysiące butelek.
__label__pl	Silnik tego samochodu zepsuł się po drodze.
__label__pl	Naprawdę tego potrzebuję.
__label__pl	Czy jest tu ktoś jeszcze?
__label__pl	Nigdy nie jem mięsa.
__label__pl	Jesteście moimi przyjaciółmi
__label__pl	Muszę coś przeczytać.
__label__pl	Będzie gorzej.
__label__pl	Czy Tom tego próbował?
__label__pl	Będziemy tutaj.
__label__pl	Otwórzcie te drzwi.
__label__pl	Wkrótce zamierzamy zdetonować bombę.
__label__pl	Powiedziała mi, że się nie zgadza.
__label__pl	Piramidy wciąż kryją wiele tajemnic.
__label__pl	Ciemność i cisza nocy kryją w sobie najskrytsze myśli.
__label__pl	To był głęboki mrok.
__label__pl	Pocierałam zapałki w ciemności.
__label__pl	Szybko zgaś lampę, ukryjemy się w ciemności!
__label__pl	Teraz, gdy król bez dziedzica oszalał, a ród został otruty, nadeszła wreszcie szansa na objęcie tronu przez generała.
__label__pl	To będzie dobre.
__label__pl	Ten żółty dom jest piękny.
__label__pl	Jestem bardzo nieśmiała.
__label__pl	Jestem bardzo nieśmiały.
__label__pl	Przyjdziecie dziś wieczorem?
__label__pl	Tom jest niezdecydowany.
__label__pl	Ta filiżanka jest biała.
__label__pl	Tom nienawidził Mary.
__label__pl	Ona wygląda młodo.
__label__pl	Tom nigdy się nie śmieje.
__label__pl	Widzę twój dom.
__label__pl	To żadna nowość.
__label__pl	Ken ma dwa koty.
__label__pl	Uczę się powoli.
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie czujesz się szczęśliwy?
__label__pl	Nie musisz pracować w niedziele.
__label__pl	Jem kurczaka.
__label__pl	Czy to nie jest wspaniałe?
__label__pl	Pozwól mi to usłyszeć.
__label__pl	Objęła go.
__label__pl	Dracula pije krew.
__label__pl	Kto jest następny w kolejce?
__label__pl	On widzi dom.
__label__pl	Wstaję o siódmej.
__label__pl	Klaskałem.
__label__pl	Palę.
__label__pl	Śmierdzę.
__label__pl	Krzyknąłem.
__label__pl	Zatrzymałem się.
__label__pl	Odwołałem.
__label__pl	Zbadaj to.
__label__pl	Zjedz to.
__label__pl	Przeczytaj tą pieprzoną instrukcję!
__label__pl	Tom czyta teraz instrukcję.
__label__pl	Chcesz zjeść posiłek w tej karczmie?
__label__pl	Niektórzy uważali, że Nixon powinien był stawić się w sądzie.
__label__pl	Niektóre z taryf wynosiły nawet sześćdziesiąt procent.
__label__pl	Ten kryzys groził podziałem państwa.
__label__pl	Nie będę dzisiaj śpiewał.
__label__pl	Tom myślał, że zrobienie tego będzie bezpieczne.
__label__pl	Jak bardzo tego chcesz?
__label__pl	Tom jest kapitanem drużyny.
__label__pl	Chyba nie oczekujesz, że ci pomogę, co?
__label__pl	Tom obiecał Mary, że nigdy już nie zobaczy się z Alice.
__label__pl	Tom obiecał, że już nigdy mnie nie uderzy.
__label__pl	Tom bardzo boi się ciemności.
__label__pl	Tom musiał wiedzieć, że Mary nie będzie chciała go na jej imprezie.
__label__pl	Ile dostajesz kieszonkowego od swoich rodziców?
__label__pl	To mało prawdopodobne, że Tom będzie znał tę piosenkę.
__label__pl	Nie bądź taki zadufany w sobie.
__label__pl	Musimy posprzątać kuchnię.
__label__pl	Jestem aspirującym pisarzem.
__label__pl	Chcesz ze mną grać?
__label__pl	Mąż Tomasza jest gejem.
__label__pl	Kobieta śpi w sypialni.
__label__pl	Rzeczywiście nie jesteś idiotą.
__label__pl	Tom został dźgnięty trzy razy.
__label__pl	Budzę się o siódmej.
__label__pl	Tom umiera z głodu.
__label__pl	Kto stoi?
__label__pl	My stoimy.
__label__pl	Kto żartuje?
__label__pl	Kto nuci?
__label__pl	Ja nucę.
__label__pl	Tom nuci.
__label__pl	Kto przychodzi?
__label__pl	Nie trać nadziei!
__label__pl	Wspierajcie Toma!
__label__pl	Zostawcie to.
__label__pl	Urozmaicenie odświeża.
__label__pl	Tańczyłem.
__label__pl	Przeskocz to!
__label__pl	Przeskocz nad tym!
__label__pl	Oni byli posłuszni.
__label__pl	Tom rozmawia.
__label__pl	Miej szacunek!
__label__pl	Nikt się nie śmiał.
__label__pl	Nikt się nie śmieje.
__label__pl	Bredzisz.
__label__pl	Nikt nie nadchodzi.
__label__pl	Lubię tańczyć.
__label__pl	Potrzebuję kogoś.
__label__pl	Twój jest tam.
__label__pl	Pająki przędą sieci.
__label__pl	Był w stanie uciec.
__label__pl	On jest aktorem.
__label__pl	Koszty utrzymania rosną.
__label__pl	Dobrze. A tobie?
__label__pl	Ona mnie zna.
__label__pl	Jest aktywna.
__label__pl	Pająki tkają sieci.
__label__pl	Lubię oba.
__label__pl	Lubię obie.
__label__pl	Będzie pochmurno.
__label__pl	Tylko tutaj podpisać.
__label__pl	Oni potrafią pływać.
__label__pl	Świętuję.
__label__pl	Krwawię.
__label__pl	Oni się kłócą.
__label__pl	Ktoś rozmawia.
__label__pl	Czy napoje są bezpłatne?
__label__pl	To nic nie znaczy!
__label__pl	Odrób zadanie domowe.
__label__pl	On jest ślepy.
__label__pl	Jestem tłumaczem.
__label__pl	Gram w tenisa.
__label__pl	Co chcesz?
__label__pl	Wezmę udział.
__label__pl	Czy ona jest taksówkarzem?
__label__pl	Chodźmy teraz!
__label__pl	Studiujemy muzykę.
__label__pl	On źle widzi.
__label__pl	Jest pan mądry.
__label__pl	Czy jest wietrznie?
__label__pl	Czy wieje wiatr?
__label__pl	Zgaś ogień!
__label__pl	Czy nadal pada deszcz?
__label__pl	Pada jeszcze?
__label__pl	Zachorowałem.
__label__pl	Przyjdę dzisiaj.
__label__pl	Czy jesteście przyjaciółmi?
__label__pl	Nie odchodź!
__label__pl	Hiszpański jest łatwy.
__label__pl	Ona mówi po portugalsku.
__label__pl	Bał się pan?
__label__pl	Baliście się?
__label__pl	Czy będzie padać?
__label__pl	Czy jest pan sam?
__label__pl	Nam jest gorąco.
__label__pl	Robi się zimniej.
__label__pl	Będzie zimniej.
__label__pl	On jest kierowcą autobusu.
__label__pl	Nie chcę nigdzie iść.
__label__pl	Zostańcie siedzieć.
__label__pl	Milczał.
__label__pl	Kocham konie.
__label__pl	Wejdź do pokoju.
__label__pl	Chodź do pokoju.
__label__pl	Oni lubią kawę.
__label__pl	Czy chce pan lody?
__label__pl	Nie denerwuje mnie.
__label__pl	Brzmi łatwo.
__label__pl	Brzmi lekko.
__label__pl	Ona była idealna.
__label__pl	Była idealna.
__label__pl	Byłeś idealny.
__label__pl	Gdzie on gra?
__label__pl	Pozwól mi mówić.
__label__pl	To jest sabotaż.
__label__pl	To nic nie da.
__label__pl	Chcę zostać.
__label__pl	Odwiedziłem Toma.
__label__pl	Czego oni szukają?
__label__pl	To skomplikowane.
__label__pl	To jest ładne.
__label__pl	To jest trucizna.
__label__pl	Mam problemy.
__label__pl	Poczekajmy tutaj!
__label__pl	Musi pan pomóc!
__label__pl	Musicie pomóc!
__label__pl	Musisz zacząć!
__label__pl	Musi pan zacząć!
__label__pl	Co myślicie?
__label__pl	Będę walczyć.
__label__pl	Jestem łysy.
__label__pl	Miał szczęście.
__label__pl	To jest na dole.
__label__pl	To jest poniżej.
__label__pl	To jest dziecinne.
__label__pl	Sprawdźmy.
__label__pl	Zaatakujmy.
__label__pl	Zjedzmy.
__label__pl	Zapytajmy.
__label__pl	Improwizujmy.
__label__pl	Świętujmy.
__label__pl	Zrelaksujmy się.
__label__pl	Wyjdźmy.
__label__pl	Pracujmy.
__label__pl	Niech Tom odpowie.
__label__pl	Niech Tom przyjdzie.
__label__pl	Niech Tom zdecyduje.
__label__pl	Nie mogę pozwolić ci odejść.
__label__pl	Nie mogę pozwolić ci ryzykować.
__label__pl	Nie mogę pozwolić ci wejść bez przepustki.
__label__pl	Pozwól mi odejść!
__label__pl	Spotkaliśmy się w zeszłym tygodniu.
__label__pl	To się stało w zeszłym tygodniu.
__label__pl	W zeszłym tygodniu padało.
__label__pl	Widziałem ją w zeszłym tygodniu.
__label__pl	Zrobiliśmy to w zeszłym tygodniu.
__label__pl	W zeszłym tygodniu byliśmy bardzo zajęci.
__label__pl	W zeszłym tygodniu nie byłem zajęty.
__label__pl	Tom zmarł w zeszłym roku.
__label__pl	Stało się to w zeszłym roku.
__label__pl	Kupiłem to w zeszłym roku.
__label__pl	Tom miał długie włosy w zeszłym roku.
__label__pl	Tom dużo podróżował w zeszłym roku.
__label__pl	Gdzie pracowałeś w zeszłym roku?
__label__pl	Zejdź na dół.
__label__pl	Zszedł na dół.
__label__pl	Jestem na dole.
__label__pl	Mój ogród jest mały.
__label__pl	Kocham twój ogród.
__label__pl	Każdy dom miał ogród.
__label__pl	Co jest w ogrodzie?
__label__pl	Podleję ogród.
__label__pl	Poszła na górę.
__label__pl	Zabierz Toma na górę.
__label__pl	Kto jest teraz na górze?
__label__pl	Mój pokój jest na górze.
__label__pl	Pewnego wieczoru do mojego domu przyszedł mężczyzna.
__label__pl	Pewnego dnia Tom zrozumie.
__label__pl	Spotkamy się ponownie pewnego dnia.
__label__pl	Czy zgłosiłeś co się stało?
__label__pl	Nie chciałem was obrazić.
__label__pl	Co państwu powiedziano?
__label__pl	Tom kupił sobie motocykl.
__label__pl	Już to omawialiśmy.
__label__pl	Już o tym dyskutowaliśmy.
__label__pl	Ukryliście pieniądze?
__label__pl	Czy ukrył pan pieniądze?
__label__pl	Mam żaglówkę.
__label__pl	Tom się śpieszy.
__label__pl	Oni się śmieją.
__label__pl	Niech pan pyta!
__label__pl	Widzisz.
__label__pl	Zobaczysz.
__label__pl	On widzi.
__label__pl	Czekolada smakuje słodko.
__label__pl	Niech mi pan odpowie.
__label__pl	Musisz sprawdzić każdą informację.
__label__pl	Masz serw.
__label__pl	Samochód wpadł mi w poślizg na zakręcie.
__label__pl	4. Olej sezamowy w woku podgrzać i roztopić masło.
__label__pl	Wymieszać składniki w misce.
__label__pl	Tylko do użytku zewnętrznego.
__label__pl	Lekarz podał pacjentowi lek.
__label__pl	Ta maszyna nie jest łatwa w obsłudze.
__label__pl	Tom ma słabą pamięć.
__label__pl	Mam pamięć złotej rybki.
__label__pl	Ból ustąpi.
__label__pl	Gdy pan weźmie ten lek, skurcze żołądka ustąpią.
__label__pl	Brak wejścia!
__label__pl	Kogo to interesuje?
__label__pl	Powiedziane, zrobione!
__label__pl	Spieszyło się.
__label__pl	Uśmiechnij się!
__label__pl	Poddaj się!
__label__pl	Zrezygnuj!
__label__pl	On stał.
__label__pl	Czerwone wino, proszę.
__label__pl	Wstydźcie się!
__label__pl	Idziecie?
__label__pl	No dobrze!
__label__pl	To żyje!
__label__pl	Nauczasz?
__label__pl	Rozzłościł się.
__label__pl	Chudnę.
__label__pl	Nie umieraj, Tom.
__label__pl	Zostałem złapany.
__label__pl	Zdenerwowała się.
__label__pl	Oni się zdenerwowali.
__label__pl	Ona była ostatnia.
__label__pl	Wszystko stało się czarne.
__label__pl	Zostałem zwolniony.
__label__pl	Tom został zamordowany.
__label__pl	Tysiące zostało bez pracy.
__label__pl	Tom został zatrudniony.
__label__pl	Tom został policjantem.
__label__pl	Zostałem wykorzystany.
__label__pl	Tom został zabity.
__label__pl	Zostaliśmy rozdzieleni.
__label__pl	Dom został sprzedany.
__label__pl	Kiedy zostało to wybudowane?
__label__pl	Moje marzenie stało się rzeczywistością.
__label__pl	Jak Tom został zamordowany?
__label__pl	To zostało już sprawdzone.
__label__pl	Co zostało ci powiedziane.
__label__pl	Zostaliśmy okradzeni.
__label__pl	W tym tygodniu nie zostaliśmy opłaceni.
__label__pl	Tom jest porządny.
__label__pl	Zrób to zaraz!
__label__pl	Tom jest sprzedawcą.
__label__pl	Tom jest pisarzem.
__label__pl	Czy on się teraz uczy?
__label__pl	Tom właśnie wędkuje.
__label__pl	Tom jest silny.
__label__pl	Tom jest śmieszny.
__label__pl	Tom chciał zostać.
__label__pl	Tom cię kocha.
__label__pl	Tom kocha panią.
__label__pl	Tom kocha was.
__label__pl	On będzie znienawidzony.
__label__pl	On jest znienawidzony.
__label__pl	Po prostu odejdź.
__label__pl	Tom wpadł do środka.
__label__pl	Potrzebujemy narzędzia.
__label__pl	Kto mówi po francusku?
__label__pl	Lubię piosenki ludowe.
__label__pl	Jutro pracujemy.
__label__pl	Tom jest jasnowidzem.
__label__pl	Tom jest psychologiem.
__label__pl	Taksówka czeka.
__label__pl	To nie pomaga.
__label__pl	Tom stał się poważny.
__label__pl	Czy to jest możliwe?
__label__pl	Tom chce mówić.
__label__pl	Tom wygra.
__label__pl	Oni chcą pomóc.
__label__pl	Pomagaliśmy sobie nawzajem.
__label__pl	Tom chce działać.
__label__pl	Będziemy gotować.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy zaniepokojeni.
__label__pl	Jest noc.
__label__pl	Niech nam pan pomoże!
__label__pl	Nic nie powiedziała.
__label__pl	Tom chciał Mary.
__label__pl	Mam nietolerancję laktozy.
__label__pl	Idź po prostu za Tomem.
__label__pl	Po prostu idź dalej!
__label__pl	Po prostu to zignoruj!
__label__pl	Dźwięk strzelania z karabinu przełamał poranną ciszę.
__label__pl	Nie mogę cię tu po prostu zostawić.
__label__pl	Nie mogę pana po prostu tu zostawić.
__label__pl	Na te pytania da się łatwo odpowiedzieć.
__label__pl	Po prostu już cię nie rozumiem.
__label__pl	Nie może pan po prostu iść.
__label__pl	Jestem po prostu tylko leniwy.
__label__pl	Niech pan po prostu pozwoli Tomowi odejść.
__label__pl	Po prostu pozwól Tomowi odejść.
__label__pl	Po prostu pozwólcie Tomowi odejść.
__label__pl	To jest po prostu wspaniałe!
__label__pl	Gdzie jest lekarz?
__label__pl	On idzie do lekarza.
__label__pl	Tom poszedł do lekarza.
__label__pl	Nie mogłem spać.
__label__pl	Nie mogłem odpowiedzieć.
__label__pl	To nie mogło zaszkodzić.
__label__pl	Nie mogłem oddychać.
__label__pl	Tom nie umiał pływać.
__label__pl	Tom nie mógł przestać.
__label__pl	Nie mogłem czekać.
__label__pl	Nie mogłem na to nic poradzić.
__label__pl	Nie mogłem się ruszyć.
__label__pl	Co przegapiłeś?
__label__pl	Udało ci się.
__label__pl	U nas wszystko w porządku.
__label__pl	Tom was znajdzie.
__label__pl	Rzeczywiście widzieliśmy ten wypadek.
__label__pl	Nie mogę oddychać.
__label__pl	To jest wygodne.
__label__pl	Byłeś zajęty?
__label__pl	Jestem starszy niż Tom.
__label__pl	Czy moja odpowiedź jest poprawna?
__label__pl	Pośpieszcie się!
__label__pl	Co wam powiedziano?
__label__pl	Usiądźcie przy stole.
__label__pl	Czy jeden z was to Tom?
__label__pl	Może mogę wam pomóc.
__label__pl	Tom się was boi.
__label__pl	Czy powinienem wam pomóc przy zmywaniu.
__label__pl	Nie mam dla was czasu.
__label__pl	Nie mogę wam tego dać.
__label__pl	Tom ma pytanie.
__label__pl	Nie lubisz nas?
__label__pl	Idziesz do pracy.
__label__pl	Nie mogę cię uratować.
__label__pl	Czy jest pan pijany?
__label__pl	To tylko przeziębienie.
__label__pl	Chcę zjeść pizzę.
__label__pl	Coś tu ładnie pachnie.
__label__pl	Lubię chleb.
__label__pl	Ona idzie do domu.
__label__pl	Tom jest bez koszuli.
__label__pl	Czy mam czerwone uszy?
__label__pl	Kupuję wodę.
__label__pl	Czy ja go znam?
__label__pl	Sprowadź go tu.
__label__pl	Ona tęskni za nim.
__label__pl	Ona go obraziła.
__label__pl	Możesz do niego zadzwonić?
__label__pl	Znajdzie go pan.
__label__pl	Tom go widział.
__label__pl	Skąd go pan zna?
__label__pl	Kto teraz go ma?
__label__pl	Znalazłem go.
__label__pl	Znaleźliśmy go.
__label__pl	Kto go znalazł?
__label__pl	Tom go znalazł.
__label__pl	Czy Tom go znalazł?
__label__pl	Trzeba go umyć.
__label__pl	Zepsułeś go?
__label__pl	Ukradłeś go?
__label__pl	Ona jest w nim zakochana.
__label__pl	Widziałem go niedawno.
__label__pl	Jeszcze go nie spotkałem.
__label__pl	Musisz się pospieszyć.
__label__pl	Chcę cię znowu zobaczyć.
__label__pl	Powinieneś się wstydzić!
__label__pl	Chcę z tobą porozmawiać.
__label__pl	Nie znam cię.
__label__pl	Kto cię zatrudnił?
__label__pl	Nie potrzebujemy cię.
__label__pl	Liczymy na ciebie.
__label__pl	Zadzwonimy do ciebie.
__label__pl	Wsiądź do samochodu!
__label__pl	Znajdą cię.
__label__pl	Widziałem cię.
__label__pl	Zadzwonimy do pana.
__label__pl	Czy mogę zapłacić później?
__label__pl	Jak mogę za to zapłacić?
__label__pl	Tom zapłaci.
__label__pl	Kto ci płaci?
__label__pl	Pozwól mi zapłacić dziś wieczorem.
__label__pl	Płacę gotówką.
__label__pl	Zapłacę ci.
__label__pl	Chciałem zapłacić.
__label__pl	Nie zapłaciłem.
__label__pl	Możemy zapłacić.
__label__pl	Zapłacę za to.
__label__pl	Dobrze płacimy Tomowi.
__label__pl	Muszę zapłacić rachunek od lekarza.
__label__pl	Otrzymałem to bez zapłaty.
__label__pl	Zapłacę ten rachunek.
__label__pl	Chcesz tego czy nie?
__label__pl	Jest prawie lato.
__label__pl	Te nożyczki są nowe.
__label__pl	Ten kwiat jest żółty.
__label__pl	Ma pan pięć dolarów?
__label__pl	Zimą słońce zachodzi wcześniej.
__label__pl	Jestem twoim partnerem.
__label__pl	Jest mi bardzo zimno.
__label__pl	Czekam na światłach.
__label__pl	Czy on jest Amerykaninem?
__label__pl	Usiadłem.
__label__pl	Otwórz bramę!
__label__pl	W stawie pływa duża złota rybka.
__label__pl	Wszędzie są kałuże.
__label__pl	Kosiłem trawnik Toma.
__label__pl	Czy łazienka jest gotowa?
__label__pl	Proszę, weź kąpiel.
__label__pl	Czy łazienka jest czysta?
__label__pl	Użyj poręczy.
__label__pl	Jak mam tego używać?
__label__pl	Nich pan użyje farby akrylowej.
__label__pl	Można korzystać z mojego samochodu.
__label__pl	Można tego użyć jako noża.
__label__pl	Kto może używać syreny alarmowej?
__label__pl	Czy mogę to zobaczyć?
__label__pl	Czy mogę państwu pomóc?
__label__pl	Czy mogę pana o coś zapytać?
__label__pl	Czy mogę wejść na pokład?
__label__pl	Czy mogę to wypożyczyć?
__label__pl	Czy mogę to jeszcze raz zobaczyć?
__label__pl	Czy mogę krótko z panem porozmawiać?
__label__pl	Czy mogę krótko z tobą porozmawiać?
__label__pl	Nie możesz grać.
__label__pl	Możesz zaparkować tutaj.
__label__pl	Możesz już iść.
__label__pl	Nie wolno ci zabijać.
__label__pl	Wolno ci iść do domu.
__label__pl	Czy możemy tutaj robić zdjęcia?
__label__pl	Wypij swoje mleko!
__label__pl	Tom był na zewnątrz.
__label__pl	Oni są zaręczeni.
__label__pl	Czy jesteś nieśmiały?
__label__pl	Lubię ryzyko.
__label__pl	To jest ekscytujące.
__label__pl	Tom dużo podróżuje.
__label__pl	Wszyscy lubili Toma.
__label__pl	Czy oni tu byli?
__label__pl	Uwielbiam hamburgery.
__label__pl	Pozwól Tomowi żyć!
__label__pl	Biorę Toma.
__label__pl	Kto ma wartę?
__label__pl	Lubię wspinaczkę.
__label__pl	Każdy czegoś chce.
__label__pl	Przeżyje pan.
__label__pl	Oni przeżyją.
__label__pl	Tom jest w potrzebie.
__label__pl	Kto mi towarzyszy?
__label__pl	Czy Tom jest artystą?
__label__pl	Popatrz na niego.
__label__pl	Chodźmy w górę!
__label__pl	Byłeś zazdrosny.
__label__pl	To było krępujące.
__label__pl	To było niezręczne.
__label__pl	Czy Tom jest sam?
__label__pl	Nie mieliśmy racji.
__label__pl	Tom jest głodny?
__label__pl	To było puste.
__label__pl	Jest pan wolny.
__label__pl	Oni są wolni.
__label__pl	Im jest zimno.
__label__pl	Tom umie gotować.
__label__pl	Tom nic nie znalazł.
__label__pl	Tom im zaufał.
__label__pl	Tom ufa jej.
__label__pl	Tom ci ufa.
__label__pl	Tom panu ufa.
__label__pl	Tom ufa wam.
__label__pl	Byli wszędzie.
__label__pl	Byli zaręczeni.
__label__pl	Były brudne.
__label__pl	Były zabłocone.
__label__pl	Czy Tom został zwolniony?
__label__pl	Tom opuścił Boston.
__label__pl	Kto tam idzie?
__label__pl	Podziwiam was.
__label__pl	Musi pan walczyć!
__label__pl	Mój motocykl jest nowy.
__label__pl	Co mam zobaczyć?
__label__pl	Jak możemy panu podziękować?
__label__pl	Pies Toma mnie ugryzł.
__label__pl	Sam je zrobiłem.
__label__pl	Jestem wujem Toma.
__label__pl	Szukam mojego dowodu osobistego.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy inni.
__label__pl	Tom jest psychiatrą.
__label__pl	Składowanie śmieci zabronione.
__label__pl	Kochałaś Toma?
__label__pl	Te książki należą do mnie.
__label__pl	To nie jest czyste.
__label__pl	Gdzie leży Boston?
__label__pl	Jest szybki.
__label__pl	Nie przezięb się!
__label__pl	Nienawidzę tego.
__label__pl	Przyjedź mnie odwiedzić.
__label__pl	On nadal śpiewał.
__label__pl	Zrób to natychmiast.
__label__pl	Tom dobrze gotuje.
__label__pl	Nic nie powiedział.
__label__pl	Ona miała depresje.
__label__pl	Miałem ból głowy.
__label__pl	Ubawiłem się.
__label__pl	Miałem rację.
__label__pl	Tom tęsknił za domem.
__label__pl	Może byłem w błędzie.
__label__pl	Tom miał syna.
__label__pl	Tom miał piwo.
__label__pl	Nic nie spałem.
__label__pl	Miałem udar.
__label__pl	Co Tom miał na sobie?
__label__pl	Co Tom miał ubrane?
__label__pl	To miało słodki smak.
__label__pl	Auto się zepsuło.
__label__pl	Czy Tom miał dużo roboty?
__label__pl	Nie miałem na to czasu.
__label__pl	Miał założone okulary.
__label__pl	On nie miał już pieniędzy.
__label__pl	Jeszcze nigdy nie miałem samochodu.
__label__pl	Co miał Tom?
__label__pl	Mieliśmy to?
__label__pl	Wszyscy byli głodni.
__label__pl	Mieliśmy wątpliwości.
__label__pl	Tom nigdy nie uczył się niemieckiego.
__label__pl	Mieliśmy plan.
__label__pl	Zjedliśmy obfitą kolację.
__label__pl	Nie mieliśmy na to czasu.
__label__pl	Wiedziałem.
__label__pl	Ona pracuje w branży artystycznej.
__label__pl	Wiedziałem to.
__label__pl	Kto o tym wiedział?
__label__pl	Ponieś konsekwencje.
__label__pl	To był głupi błąd.
__label__pl	Przez wizjer ujrzała nieznajomą twarz.
__label__pl	Czy mógłbyś się uspokoić trochę?
__label__pl	Tom wiedział za dużo.
__label__pl	Już to wiedziałem.
__label__pl	Tom chciał umrzeć.
__label__pl	Chciałem powiedzieć nie.
__label__pl	Chciałem zostać dziennikarzem.
__label__pl	Chciałem być wolny.
__label__pl	Chciałem kurtkę.
__label__pl	Chciałem pomóc Tomowi.
__label__pl	Chciałem ci ją pokazać.
__label__pl	Nie chciałem tego powiedzieć.
__label__pl	Zawsze chciałem mieć córkę.
__label__pl	Chciałem też zostać w Bostonie.
__label__pl	Chcieliśmy deser.
__label__pl	Twoje spodnie są brudne.
__label__pl	Widzimy dom.
__label__pl	Tom ugryzł Mary.
__label__pl	Czy to Tom?
__label__pl	Czy woda jest zimna?
__label__pl	Tom nie powiedział nam o tym.
__label__pl	Będziemy krzyczeć.
__label__pl	Pójdziemy.
__label__pl	Będą umierać.
__label__pl	Jest wiele do zrobienia.
__label__pl	Czy Tom ma dużo do roboty?
__label__pl	Ile kosztuje pół kilograma?
__label__pl	Mam tyle samo pieniędzy, co on.
__label__pl	Ten stół zajmuje zbyt dużo miejsca.
__label__pl	To jest o wiele za ciężkie.
__label__pl	Ile kosztuje bilet?
__label__pl	Nie dostałem wiele.
__label__pl	Czytasz za dużo.
__label__pl	Dużo się nauczyłem.
__label__pl	Nie jem dużo.
__label__pl	Ale ty dużo jesz!
__label__pl	Wiele od niego oczekujemy.
__label__pl	Dużo dzisiaj pracowałem.
__label__pl	Wiele ludzi odeszło.
__label__pl	W rzece pływa dużo ryb.
__label__pl	Ile macie długopisów?
__label__pl	Ile jest łodzi ratunkowych?
__label__pl	Ile noży potrzebujesz?
__label__pl	Tom jest stary.
__label__pl	Muszę pomyśleć.
__label__pl	Muszę się zastanowić.
__label__pl	Moje ręce się trzęsą.
__label__pl	Byłem śpiący.
__label__pl	Tom jest Kanadyjczykiem.
__label__pl	Jestem Kanadyjczykiem.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy Kanadyjczykami.
__label__pl	Mamy czas?
__label__pl	To są mordercy.
__label__pl	On pije wodę.
__label__pl	Wszyscy lubią Toma.
__label__pl	Jestem analfabetą.
__label__pl	Co ja słyszę?
__label__pl	Mam grypę.
__label__pl	Uczę się esperanto.
__label__pl	Jestem wypoczęty.
__label__pl	Jestem zrelaksowany.
__label__pl	Pomagam mu.
__label__pl	Też idę.
__label__pl	Jestem obrażony.
__label__pl	Jestem śmiertelnie zmęczony.
__label__pl	Jestem na górze.
__label__pl	Ona pewnie jest chora.
__label__pl	Musi być zmęczony.
__label__pl	Jego ojciec nie gra w golfa.
__label__pl	On nie może być chory.
__label__pl	Ten chłopiec jest jego bratem.
__label__pl	Wydaje się być bogata.
__label__pl	Ona musi być bardzo szczęśliwa.
__label__pl	Nie chcę być bogaty.
__label__pl	Gdzie będziesz?
__label__pl	Złamał swoje słowo.
__label__pl	Oni muszą być martwi.
__label__pl	Muszę być ślepy.
__label__pl	Będziemy tam.
__label__pl	Muszę być ostrożniejszy.
__label__pl	Nigdy cię nie zapomniałem.
__label__pl	To nie jest nowe.
__label__pl	Podpisałem formularz.
__label__pl	Oni nie są sami.
__label__pl	Nie jest pan sam.
__label__pl	Będzie to trwać długo?
__label__pl	Kto lubi popcorn?
__label__pl	To są kanibale.
__label__pl	Tom posadził kwiaty.
__label__pl	Jestem teraz sam.
__label__pl	Ugotowałem spaghetti.
__label__pl	Tom zostanie.
__label__pl	Nie znacie mojego brata.
__label__pl	Tom tego nie zrobił.
__label__pl	Wyłącz system alarmowy.
__label__pl	Zamówię coś do jedzenia.
__label__pl	Zamawiam coś do jedzenia.
__label__pl	Nie rzucaj niczego na podłogę!
__label__pl	Musisz nam to powiedzieć.
__label__pl	Spaliłem ją.
__label__pl	Ty znasz to.
__label__pl	To jest moje zdanie!
__label__pl	Mieszkam na farmie.
__label__pl	Czy wy to zrobiliście?
__label__pl	Ona idzie do windy.
__label__pl	Wszystko jest świeże.
__label__pl	Farba się złuszczyła.
__label__pl	Gdzie jest mój płaszcz?
__label__pl	Nie muszę już nosić okularów.
__label__pl	Przestał mówić.
__label__pl	Moja matka nie umie jeździć na rowerze.
__label__pl	Zamieszkajmy tutaj.
__label__pl	Dziewczyny wygrały.
__label__pl	Dom jest mały.
__label__pl	Nienawidzę was wszystkich.
__label__pl	Nie mieszaj się.
__label__pl	Jeden z was kłamie.
__label__pl	Jest problem.
__label__pl	Widzisz to?
__label__pl	Nienawidzę wywiadów.
__label__pl	Nie bądź szalony.
__label__pl	Jesteś problemem.
__label__pl	Muszę iść sam.
__label__pl	Steve nie wrócił do domu.
__label__pl	Sprowadzę pomoc.
__label__pl	Tom prawdopodobnie czeka.
__label__pl	Chcę mieć basen.
__label__pl	Gotowe.
__label__pl	Podoba mi się ta odpowiedź.
__label__pl	Kazał mi czekać.
__label__pl	Już próbowałem.
__label__pl	Gdzie jest moja filiżanka.
__label__pl	Oni są tam.
__label__pl	Tom był tutaj.
__label__pl	Czytanie to moja pasja.
__label__pl	Maria jest zabawna.
__label__pl	Nie byłem pijany.
__label__pl	Tom nie cierpi szczurów.
__label__pl	Tom jest mały.
__label__pl	Nigdy nie pytasz.
__label__pl	Czy to kawa?
__label__pl	Co oni zamierzają zrobić?
__label__pl	Oni was znajdą.
__label__pl	Czy to ptak?
__label__pl	Pociłem się.
__label__pl	Musisz to dla mnie zrobić.
__label__pl	Musimy je znaleźć.
__label__pl	Niech pan zje wszystko.
__label__pl	To dobra wiadomość.
__label__pl	Zrobiłem to dla ciebie.
__label__pl	Śpiewaliśmy przez trzy godziny.
__label__pl	Jesteś tu sam?
__label__pl	Czy Tom był bardzo zajęty?
__label__pl	Tom milczy.
__label__pl	Byłem już w łóżku.
__label__pl	Czy pan zamordował Toma?
__label__pl	Tom był bardzo bogaty.
__label__pl	Czy pan ją spotkał?
__label__pl	Palenie w łóżku jest niebezpieczne.
__label__pl	Nie psujmy tego!
__label__pl	Szukasz nas?
__label__pl	Proszek do prania się skończył.
__label__pl	Pamiętasz nas?
__label__pl	Ona przyjdzie być może jutro.
__label__pl	Gdzie jest autobus?
__label__pl	Nie dam rady tego zrobić bez ciebie.
__label__pl	Czuję się silny.
__label__pl	Ten kraj należy do niego.
__label__pl	Ten samochód jest bardzo szybki.
__label__pl	Mam żonę.
__label__pl	Jesteś o wiele za późno.
__label__pl	Nie mam przyszłości.
__label__pl	Gdzie jest moja pizza?
__label__pl	Jedź wolniej!
__label__pl	Czy Tom jest głupi?
__label__pl	Kto cię znalazł?
__label__pl	Kręcę film.
__label__pl	Gdzie jest moje miejsce?
__label__pl	Widziałem ją.
__label__pl	Nie znoszę kłamców.
__label__pl	Kocham mojego tatę.
__label__pl	On będzie tam za dziesięć minut.
__label__pl	Zadzwoń do swojego brata.
__label__pl	To nie jest sen.
__label__pl	Wiedzieliście o tym?
__label__pl	Tom będzie walczył.
__label__pl	On jest teraz przeziębiony.
__label__pl	Nie chcemy wiedzieć.
__label__pl	Ten dom jest bardzo mały.
__label__pl	Jesteś dopiero dzieckiem.
__label__pl	Jadłem kawior.
__label__pl	Kto chce herbaty?
__label__pl	Lubię tą książkę.
__label__pl	Nie jestem wolny.
__label__pl	Nie jestem wolna.
__label__pl	Musieliśmy przestać.
__label__pl	To za szybko.
__label__pl	Czy to rzeczywiście prawda?
__label__pl	Daj mi moje pieniądze.
__label__pl	Mój wujek jest bogaty.
__label__pl	Czy ma pan jabłka?
__label__pl	Kłamałem.
__label__pl	Nie muszę dzisiaj pracować.
__label__pl	Czy Tom jest tutaj?
__label__pl	To już nic nowego.
__label__pl	Jesteś ważny?
__label__pl	Nie chcę iść.
__label__pl	Tom będzie pływał.
__label__pl	Kto odniesie sukces?
__label__pl	Tom szybko się zmęczy.
__label__pl	Tom nie będzie śpiewał.
__label__pl	Tom będzie to używać.
__label__pl	Robi się zimno.
__label__pl	To będzie działać.
__label__pl	Jak to będzie zrobione?
__label__pl	Tom żyje jeszcze.
__label__pl	Dlaczego oni płaczą?
__label__pl	Dlaczego ten pośpiech?
__label__pl	Dlaczego ona tu jest?
__label__pl	Dlaczego oni tu są?
__label__pl	Po co oni tu są?
__label__pl	Dlaczego mnie pytasz?
__label__pl	Dlaczego mnie pytacie?
__label__pl	Dlaczego pyta mnie pan?
__label__pl	Dlaczego tu jestem?
__label__pl	Dlaczego jest ciemno?
__label__pl	Dlaczego to nosisz?
__label__pl	Dlaczego się zatrzymałeś?
__label__pl	Dlaczego poszedłeś?
__label__pl	Dlaczego poszliście?
__label__pl	Chcę wiedzieć, dlaczego.
__label__pl	Chciałbym wiedzieć, dlaczego.
__label__pl	Dlaczego pan poszedł?
__label__pl	Dlaczego się poruszamy?
__label__pl	Chcesz wiedzieć, dlaczego?
__label__pl	Dlaczego muszę iść?
__label__pl	Dlaczego to tam jest?
__label__pl	Dlaczego przestajesz?
__label__pl	Dlaczego to masz?
__label__pl	Dlaczego on tam jest?
__label__pl	Dlaczego musimy umrzeć?
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie słuchasz?
__label__pl	Dlaczego tam nie idziesz?
__label__pl	Dlaczego bierzesz ten lek?
__label__pl	Dlaczego pan bierze ten lek?
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie pójdziesz ze mną?
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie idziesz do domu?
__label__pl	Dlaczego dostałem czwórkę?
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie jesteś ze mną?
__label__pl	Dlaczego Tom wygląda na tak zmęczonego?
__label__pl	Dokąd chciałbyś iść?
__label__pl	Gdzie on chce iść?
__label__pl	Dokąd pan pójdzie?
__label__pl	Skąd pochodzi Tom?
__label__pl	Skąd Tom to wiedział?
__label__pl	Czekanie nic nie daje.
__label__pl	Niech pan teraz nic nie mówi!
__label__pl	To nie było nic poważnego.
__label__pl	Tu nie można nic zrobić.
__label__pl	Nie widziałem nic oprócz mgły.
__label__pl	Nie mogę tak pracować.
__label__pl	Tom czyta powoli.
__label__pl	Będziesz chciał to zobaczyć.
__label__pl	Nie wstydzę się.
__label__pl	Odpocznijcie trochę!
__label__pl	Nie opuszczaj nas!
__label__pl	Mój ojciec jest archeologiem.
__label__pl	Potrzebuję teraz Toma.
__label__pl	Tom nie mógł iść.
__label__pl	Jesteś zakochany?
__label__pl	Znałem ryzyko.
__label__pl	Zaczekamy tutaj.
__label__pl	Niech pan nie czeka!
__label__pl	Zaczekaj na nas!
__label__pl	Czekam na odlot.
__label__pl	Możesz poczekać tutaj.
__label__pl	Kiedy pan to potrzebuje?
__label__pl	Kiedy idziesz?
__label__pl	Kiedy wstałeś?
__label__pl	Kiedy jemy? Jestem głodny!
__label__pl	Kiedy on przyjdzie?
__label__pl	Kiedy idziemy?
__label__pl	Kiedy się urodziłeś?
__label__pl	Po co tu jesteśmy?
__label__pl	Do czego się tego używa?
__label__pl	Czym pan to otworzył?
__label__pl	Ile czasu potrzebujemy?
__label__pl	Jak długo ona już choruje?
__label__pl	Jak długo się tu zatrzymamy?
__label__pl	Jak długo już tu mieszkacie?
__label__pl	Pokaż to nam!
__label__pl	Zostań w środku!
__label__pl	Tom musi iść.
__label__pl	Był pan zajęty?
__label__pl	Byliście zajęci?
__label__pl	Kto jest spragniony?
__label__pl	Jesteśmy optymistami.
__label__pl	Tom jest odprężony.
__label__pl	Tom sprzedaje buty.
__label__pl	Są wszędzie!
__label__pl	Uwielbiam pandy.
__label__pl	Znałeś go?
__label__pl	Znali się.
__label__pl	Znałem Toma dobrze.
__label__pl	Nie znałem Toma.
__label__pl	Co mam powiedzieć?
__label__pl	Mamy iść razem?
__label__pl	Kiedy mam przyjść?
__label__pl	Gdzie mam zaparkować?
__label__pl	Co powinienem kupić?
__label__pl	Kiedy powinienem przyjść?
__label__pl	Trzeba je umyć.
__label__pl	Wieszam pranie.
__label__pl	Tom uwielbia zapach świeżego prania.
__label__pl	Bardzo się rozchorowałem.
__label__pl	Tom nie może być chory.
__label__pl	On robi zdjęcie.
__label__pl	Wykonaliśmy dobrą robotę.
__label__pl	Tom zrobił głośniej telewizor.
__label__pl	Tom robił notatki.
__label__pl	Ten wypadek zdarzył się tutaj.
__label__pl	Nigdy nie próbuj tego sam.
__label__pl	Nigdy nie ufaj Tomowi.
__label__pl	Nigdy się nie mylę.
__label__pl	Tom nigdy nie mówi o swojej pracy.
__label__pl	Czy możemy gdzieś porozmawiać?
__label__pl	Czy możemy się gdzieś spotkać?
__label__pl	Nikogo to nie obchodzi.
__label__pl	Nikt cię nie ocenia.
__label__pl	Nikt mnie nie obserwuje.
__label__pl	Nikt nie odwiedza Toma.
__label__pl	Nikt tego nie robi.
__label__pl	Nikt nie może wiedzieć wszystkiego.
__label__pl	Nikogo tam nie było.
__label__pl	Nikt nie może tego zrozumieć.
__label__pl	Nikt nie może tego powiedzieć.
__label__pl	Nie chcę nikogo zranić.
__label__pl	Nikt nie żył.
__label__pl	Nikt tego nie powiedział.
__label__pl	Nie chcę nikomu sprawić bólu.
__label__pl	Nikt nie może nam pomóc.
__label__pl	Nikt tu nie ma samochodu.
__label__pl	Nikogo tu nie ma oprócz mnie.
__label__pl	Ktoś idzie.
__label__pl	Tom widział kogoś.
__label__pl	Oczywiście ktoś kłamie.
__label__pl	Tom szuka kogoś.
__label__pl	Widzi pan kogoś?
__label__pl	Znalazłem kogoś.
__label__pl	Ktoś ostrzegł Toma.
__label__pl	Tam jest ktoś przy drzwiach.
__label__pl	Czy ktoś może dać mi łyżkę?
__label__pl	Ktoś ukradł mi zegarek.
__label__pl	Tom zjadł coś.
__label__pl	Trochę się spóźniłem.
__label__pl	Potrzebuję trochę snu.
__label__pl	Widziałem coś.
__label__pl	Jest mi trochę zimno.
__label__pl	Połóż się trochę!
__label__pl	To znaczy coś dla nas.
__label__pl	To znaczy coś dla mnie.
__label__pl	Jestem trochę zdenerwowany.
__label__pl	Coś się właśnie zmienia.
__label__pl	Nie mam konia.
__label__pl	Nie jesteśmy mordercami.
__label__pl	To nie był sen.
__label__pl	Nie mamy prądu.
__label__pl	Nie jesteśmy idiotami.
__label__pl	Nie lubisz czekolady, prawda?
__label__pl	Nie mamy dzisiaj lekcji.
__label__pl	Nie mam na to czasu.
__label__pl	Wynocha z mojego łóżka!
__label__pl	Tom leży w łóżku.
__label__pl	Chcę iść do łóżka.
__label__pl	Chcę do łóżka.
__label__pl	Nie pal w łóżku!
__label__pl	Tom pościelił swoje łóżko.
__label__pl	Czyje to łóżko?
__label__pl	Zmęczony poszedł do łóżka.
__label__pl	Chcę do mojego łóżka!
__label__pl	Tom ma w poniedziałek wolne.
__label__pl	Poczekaj z tym do poniedziałku!
__label__pl	Nadal jest poniedziałek.
__label__pl	Od poniedziałku do piątku padał śnieg.
__label__pl	Wrócisz we wtorek?
__label__pl	Pada od niedzieli.
__label__pl	Nie wychodziłem w ostatnią niedzielę.
__label__pl	Nie ma mnie w domu w niedziele.
__label__pl	W niedziele nie ma mnie w domu.
__label__pl	Zjedzmy obiad.
__label__pl	Zjedliście już obiad?
__label__pl	To pudełko jest ciężkie.
__label__pl	To było bardzo ciężkie.
__label__pl	Tom jest ciężko ranny.
__label__pl	Czy to było za trudne?
__label__pl	Ta filiżanka jest ciężka.
__label__pl	Ta walizka jest dla ciebie za ciężka.
__label__pl	Tom jest zdrowy.
__label__pl	On wyzdrowiał.
__label__pl	To jest bardzo zdrowe.
__label__pl	Jeszcze pada.
__label__pl	Hej, pada śnieg!
__label__pl	Wciąż pada śnieg.
__label__pl	Potrafię dobrze jeździć na nartach.
__label__pl	Tom jeździł na nartach.
__label__pl	Ona nie umie jeździć na nartach.
__label__pl	Tu jest mój rower.
__label__pl	Mam zupełnie nowy rower.
__label__pl	Mam całkiem nowy rower.
__label__pl	Chodź tu! Szybko!
__label__pl	Daj to Tomowi.
__label__pl	Pokaż jej!
__label__pl	Pokaż to jej!
__label__pl	Piwo jest dobre.
__label__pl	Dobrze zrobione.
__label__pl	Ona chce się ustatkować i mieć dzieci.
__label__pl	Gdzie on się osiedli?
__label__pl	Zagrajmy w piłkę.
__label__pl	Zamknął oczy.
__label__pl	Mary ma duże oczy.
__label__pl	Niech pan zbada przyczynę!
__label__pl	Kawa jest czarna.
__label__pl	Ona jest zawsze ubrana na czarno.
__label__pl	Czarny ci pasuje.
__label__pl	W czarnym ci do twarzy.
__label__pl	Niedługo zajdzie słońce.
__label__pl	Oni mają wszystko pod kontrolą.
__label__pl	To musi poczekać!
__label__pl	Możemy poczekać.
__label__pl	Proszę poczekaj tutaj.
__label__pl	Poczekaj jeszcze minutę.
__label__pl	Nie każ mi czekać!
__label__pl	Może pan poczekać tutaj.
__label__pl	Nie możemy czekać.
__label__pl	Czekamy na Toma.
__label__pl	Czekam na Twoją odpowiedź.
__label__pl	Wiem o co chodzi.
__label__pl	Ubierz się!
__label__pl	To śmieszne!
__label__pl	Nie wyśmiewaj się z niego!
__label__pl	Nie będę się śmiać.
__label__pl	Przestałem się śmiać.
__label__pl	Idzie pan?
__label__pl	Nie przeszkadzajcie!
__label__pl	Dziękuję za to!
__label__pl	Idź do pracy!
__label__pl	Weź kartę!
__label__pl	Jest pan wspaniały.
__label__pl	Tom jest na dole.
__label__pl	Lubię chodzić.
__label__pl	Idę do knajpy.
__label__pl	Idę trochę na spacer.
__label__pl	Idę na spacer do parku.
__label__pl	Nie idę do twojego domu.
__label__pl	Ja też tutaj chodzę do szkoły.
__label__pl	Idę do fryzjera.
__label__pl	Idę do szpitala.
__label__pl	Idę na dół.
__label__pl	Czy macie jabłka?
__label__pl	Chcę jabłko.
__label__pl	Mój koń lubi jabłka.
__label__pl	On właśnie je jabłko.
__label__pl	Zjedliśmy dużo jabłek.
__label__pl	Lubię banany bardziej niż jabłka.
__label__pl	Jabłko jest w torbie.
__label__pl	Czy na tym drzewie są jabłka?
__label__pl	Jabłko jest na półce obok garnka.
__label__pl	Słońce wschodzi.
__label__pl	Jesteś teraz mężczyzną.
__label__pl	Nie jesteś w formie.
__label__pl	Nie jesteś moim bratem.
__label__pl	Nie śpisz jeszcze?
__label__pl	Jesteś dobrą tancerką?
__label__pl	Jechałeś za szybko?
__label__pl	Jesteś gorszy niż Tom.
__label__pl	Jesteś znowu za późno.
__label__pl	Ona jest akurat poza domem.
__label__pl	Zmarła pięć lat temu.
__label__pl	Czy ona jest w domu?
__label__pl	Czy on jest w domu?
__label__pl	On jest mniej więcej w moim wieku.
__label__pl	Trzymaj się lewej strony.
__label__pl	Tom jest blondynem.
__label__pl	Nie marzę.
__label__pl	Szybko! Chodź tu!
__label__pl	Będę wujkiem.
__label__pl	Chcę wyjść z więzienia.
__label__pl	Nie chcę waszego współczucia.
__label__pl	Chcę mieć rodzinę.
__label__pl	Chcę mieć łóżko wodne.
__label__pl	Chcę znów być szczęśliwy.
__label__pl	Nie chcę pieniędzy.
__label__pl	Chcę z tobą mieszkać.
__label__pl	Nie chcę tu mieszkać.
__label__pl	Chcę stać się bogatym.
__label__pl	Nie chcę tego!
__label__pl	Chcę krzesło.
__label__pl	Chcę szczeniaka.
__label__pl	Wykorzystują cię.
__label__pl	Toma ma czerwoną twarz.
__label__pl	Wytarł pot z twarzy.
__label__pl	Straciłem wszystkie moje pieniądze.
__label__pl	Straciłem nadzieję.
__label__pl	Zgubiłem moją torbę.
__label__pl	Tom stracił cierpliwość.
__label__pl	Zgubiłem mój zegarek.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy zgubieni.
__label__pl	Tom to znalazł.
__label__pl	Czy Tom pana znalazł?
__label__pl	Znaleźli Toma.
__label__pl	Znalazłem wyjście.
__label__pl	Oni to znaleźli.
__label__pl	Tom znalazł pracę.
__label__pl	Znalazłem Toma.
__label__pl	Właśnie go znalazłem.
__label__pl	Idź do swojego pokoju!
__label__pl	Tom opuścił pokój.
__label__pl	W pokoju było zimno.
__label__pl	Podoba mi się twój pokój.
__label__pl	Tom wynajął pokój.
__label__pl	Czy twój pokój jest czysty?
__label__pl	Pokażę ci mój pokój.
__label__pl	Tom właśnie wyszedł.
__label__pl	Byłem dobry.
__label__pl	To był mój pomysł.
__label__pl	To była moja decyzja.
__label__pl	Byłem z Tomem.
__label__pl	Zawsze byłem z ciebie dumny.
__label__pl	Dostałem twój list przedwczoraj.
__label__pl	Ona pisze list.
__label__pl	Piszemy listy.
__label__pl	Podarła ten list.
__label__pl	Nie jestem martwy.
__label__pl	Nie jestem szalony.
__label__pl	Nie jestem zły!
__label__pl	Nie jestem uzbrojony.
__label__pl	Nie jestem zapominalski!
__label__pl	Nie pływałem.
__label__pl	Nie jestem jeszcze zmęczony.
__label__pl	Można mieć pewność?
__label__pl	Tom potrzebuje pieniędzy.
__label__pl	Pieniądze zmieniają ludzi.
__label__pl	Potrzebujemy tych pieniędzy.
__label__pl	Tom ma dużo pieniędzy.
__label__pl	To nie jest cukier.
__label__pl	Czy Tom to kupił?
__label__pl	Kupiłem ten samochód.
__label__pl	Kupiłem dom.
__label__pl	Tom kupił samochód.
__label__pl	Kupiłem nowy aparat fotograficzny.
__label__pl	Gdzie kupił pan ten kapelusz?
__label__pl	Mam przeczucie, że nie puści mnie tak łatwo.
__label__pl	Kupuję spodnie.
__label__pl	Niestety te spodnie mi nie pasują. Czy mogę je wymienić?
__label__pl	Jesteśmy gotowi do drogi.
__label__pl	Mamy czas.
__label__pl	Dzisiaj mam czas.
__label__pl	Czas przestać.
__label__pl	Czas odejść.
__label__pl	Nie mamy czasu na debatę.
__label__pl	Mamy czas do jutra rana.
__label__pl	Telewizor był cały czas włączony.
__label__pl	Potrzebuję jego pomocy.
__label__pl	Tom poprosił o pomoc.
__label__pl	Idź tam i pomóż Tomowi!
__label__pl	Czy Tom potrzebował pomocy?
__label__pl	Tom ma długie nogi.
__label__pl	Podobają mi się twoje nogi.
__label__pl	Jest jeszcze więcej.
__label__pl	Jest coraz więcej zdań.
__label__pl	Czy jest tam kawiarnia?
__label__pl	Czy jest godzina policyjna?
__label__pl	Czy jest nagroda?
__label__pl	Jesteście mądrzy.
__label__pl	Nie jesteście sami.
__label__pl	Nie jesteście martwi.
__label__pl	Jesteście bardzo mądrzy.
__label__pl	Jesteście bardzo zajęci.
__label__pl	Z kim tam jesteście?
__label__pl	Chwileczkę! Dlaczego tu jesteście?
__label__pl	Wy dwoje jesteście piękną parą.
__label__pl	Jesteście otoczeni.
__label__pl	Jesz obiad?
__label__pl	Ona je warzywa.
__label__pl	Jesz powoli.
__label__pl	Moja babcia je pomarańczę.
__label__pl	Mało jesz.
__label__pl	On je słodycze.
__label__pl	Zjadłeś już dziś obiad?
__label__pl	Czy Tom zjadł kolację?
__label__pl	Zjadłem o wiele za dużo.
__label__pl	Oni już jedli.
__label__pl	Zjadłem szpinak.
__label__pl	Czy Tom tam pracował?
__label__pl	Pracowałem całą noc.
__label__pl	Tom pracował w Bostonie.
__label__pl	Pracowaliście wczoraj wieczorem?
__label__pl	Zrobiliśmy naleśniki na śniadanie.
__label__pl	Zmoczyłem sobie buty.
__label__pl	Martwiłem się.
__label__pl	Nie lubię dzieci.
__label__pl	Podróżuję sam.
__label__pl	Nie mogę jechać.
__label__pl	Pojechałem pociągiem.
__label__pl	Czy Tom pojechał do domu?
__label__pl	Oni właśnie wyszli.
__label__pl	Czy Tom właśnie wyszedł?
__label__pl	Nikt nie wyszedł.
__label__pl	Tom nigdy nie mówi o swoim własnym dziecku.
__label__pl	Kładzie dzieci do łóżka.
__label__pl	Tom jest grzecznym dzieckiem.
__label__pl	Czy pan do mnie dzwonił?
__label__pl	Ugotuj dla mnie!
__label__pl	Czy mnie nienawidzisz?
__label__pl	Czy Tom mnie potrzebuje?
__label__pl	Czy pan mnie widzi?
__label__pl	Pan mnie znał.
__label__pl	Hałas mi przeszkadza.
__label__pl	Każdy mnie nienawidzi.
__label__pl	Znasz mnie.
__label__pl	Szukasz mnie?
__label__pl	Każdy mnie lubi.
__label__pl	Fascynują mnie owady.
__label__pl	Czułem się samotny.
__label__pl	Czuję się winny.
__label__pl	Przestraszyłeś mnie.
__label__pl	Czy to dla mnie?
__label__pl	Zdradziłeś mnie.
__label__pl	Nie patrz na mnie!
__label__pl	Znajdzie mnie pan.
__label__pl	Oni mnie znajdą.
__label__pl	Tom mnie uratował.
__label__pl	Zakochałem się.
__label__pl	Tom spojrzał na mnie.
__label__pl	Tak się wstydzę!
__label__pl	Muszę przeprosić.
__label__pl	Masz mnie dosyć?
__label__pl	To mnie po prostu denerwuje.
__label__pl	Co mnie zdradziło?
__label__pl	Tom mnie przytulił.
__label__pl	Będziesz za mną tęsknić.
__label__pl	Tom zrobił na mnie wrażenie.
__label__pl	Czuję się chroniony.
__label__pl	Dzwoniliście do mnie?
__label__pl	Muszę się bronić.
__label__pl	Przypominam sobie o tym.
__label__pl	Czułem się nagi.
__label__pl	Czy Tom wspomniał o mnie?
__label__pl	Nie odsyłaj mnie.
__label__pl	Odesłał mnie.
__label__pl	Myślisz o mnie?

__label__pl	Czy nie wygląda to zabawnie?
__label__pl	Czy nie wygląda to na zabawę?
__label__pl	Tom nie ma ubezpieczenia.

__label__pl	Tom wygląda podejrzliwie.
__label__pl	Mimo że rosyjski jest trudny, Tom chce się go nauczyć.
__label__pl	Tom nie jest tym, który nauczył mnie grać tę piosenkę.
__label__pl	Słyszałem, że Tom uczy się prowadzić.

__label__pl	Moje życie zmieniło się tamtego dnia.
__label__pl	Tamten dzień zmienił moje życie.
__label__pl	Nigdy wcześniej tego nie próbowałem.
__label__pl	Tom wyjął klucz z drzwi.
__label__pl	Tom naprawił drzwi.
__label__pl	Jestem pewien, że zamknąłem drzwi.
__label__pl	Tom otworzył drzwi i wszedłem.
__label__pl	Chcę usiąść przy drzwiach.
__label__pl	Dlaczego otworzyłeś drzwi?
__label__pl	Zamknąłeś drzwi?
__label__pl	Dlaczego zamykasz drzwi?
__label__pl	Wyjrzyj przez okno.
__label__pl	Czy Tom jest tu znowu?

__label__pl	Powinieneś wziąć to zdanie w nawiasy.
__label__pl	Powienieneś wziąć to zdanie w nawiasy.
__label__pl	Przestraszyłeś Toma.
__label__pl	Czułem się zastraszony.
__label__pl	Nie mam szacunku do samej siebie.
__label__pl	Ludzie szanują ludzi z wysokim poczuciem wartości.
__label__pl	Mary nie ma poczucia własnej wartości.
__label__pl	Dostałem tę książkę od niego.
__label__pl	Mam trzy zewnętrzne dyski twarde.
__label__pl	Na biurku Toma jest stos komiksów.
__label__pl	Może powinniśmy usiąść gdzie indziej.
__label__pl	Dlaczego chcesz uczyć się francuskiego?
__label__pl	Możesz to sobie wybić z głowy.
__label__pl	Niewyobrażalne!
__label__pl	Była wychowywana przez swojego dziadka.
__label__pl	Mennad umarł w tamtym roku.
__label__pl	Nie chce teraz ze mną rozmawiać i nie wiem dlaczego.
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie poprosiłeś Toma o pomoc?

__label__pl	Kurczak był martwy.
__label__pl	Tam jest miejsce do zwiedzania.
__label__pl	Czuję, że jestem ci winien wyjaśnienie.
__label__pl	Wiem, że to docenisz.
__label__pl	Ukrył pieniądze pod ubraniem.
__label__pl	Nie jestem z Algierii.
__label__pl	Sami myślał, że czarny kot Layli był opętany.
__label__pl	Tomek nie wie jak dostać się do domu Marii.
__label__pl	Chciałbym poznać mój stan konta.
__label__pl	Tom założył okulary.
__label__pl	Chciałbym więcej zarabiać.
__label__pl	Nie potrafimy żyć za 150,000 yenów miesięcznie.
__label__pl	Czy muszę jeść z Tomkiem?
__label__pl	Tomek odziedziczył dużą sumę pieniędzy.
__label__pl	Nie traktowali mnie źle.
__label__pl	Musimy skończyć to, co zaczęliśmy.
__label__pl	Płakała w swoim pokoju.
__label__pl	Tom pisze bardzo schludnie, prawda?
__label__pl	Szukaliśmy wszędzie, ale nie znaleźliśmy nic.
__label__pl	To niecodzienne.
__label__pl	Oni próbują pomóc.
__label__pl	Lało.
__label__pl	Ten nóż nie jest zbyt ostry.
__label__pl	Widzę drzewo.
__label__pl	To drzewo jest bardzo stare.
__label__pl	To drzewo jest duże.
__label__pl	Możecie zaparkować tutaj.
__label__pl	Ona idzie do parku.
__label__pl	Park był pełen ludzi.
__label__pl	Może pan zaparkować tutaj.
__label__pl	To był kiedyś duży park.
__label__pl	Siedzieliśmy na ławce w parku.
__label__pl	Gdzie pan parkuje?
__label__pl	Podnosi swoją rękę.
__label__pl	Zdrętwiała mi noga.
__label__pl	Złamałem nogę podczas jazdy na nartach.
__label__pl	Muszę rozprostować nogi.
__label__pl	Moje kolano krwawi.
__label__pl	Nie zasypiaj znowu!
__label__pl	Nie mogłem spać ostatniej nocy.
__label__pl	Niech pan spróbuje spać!
__label__pl	Gdzie mam spać?
__label__pl	Sen jest niezbędny.
__label__pl	Czy Tom już nie śpi?
__label__pl	Lek zadziałał.
__label__pl	Czy bierzesz swoje leki?
__label__pl	Czy jesteś uczulony na ten lek?
__label__pl	To jest lek na biegunkę.
__label__pl	Ten lek bardzo pomógł.
__label__pl	Czy mogę się rozejrzeć?
__label__pl	Nie rozglądaj się!
__label__pl	Chcę to przymierzyć.
__label__pl	Uczesz włosy zanim wyjdziesz.
__label__pl	Umyj sobie twarz i uczesz włosy.
__label__pl	Gorączka spadła.
__label__pl	Wczoraj miałem wysoką gorączkę.
__label__pl	Czy ona nadal ma gorączkę?
__label__pl	On nie ma gorączki.
__label__pl	Biegam dwa razy w tygodniu.
__label__pl	Jestem w Bostonie.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy nieszczęśliwi.
__label__pl	Wyrzuć to.
__label__pl	Nie strasz mnie!
__label__pl	To są szpiedzy.
__label__pl	Nie jestem magikiem.
__label__pl	Przejdź do rzeczy!
__label__pl	Chcę rozwodu.
__label__pl	To dobre mięso.
__label__pl	Podajcie nam proszę kilka przykładów.
__label__pl	Chciałbym ci przedstawić mojego syna.
__label__pl	O to chcę zapytać.
__label__pl	Nie sprzeciwiaj się nam!
__label__pl	Tom nas zobaczył.
__label__pl	Czasy są ciężkie.
__label__pl	Twój angielski jest perfekcyjny.
__label__pl	Kupuję baterię.
__label__pl	Pijesz piwo?
__label__pl	Dostałeś już piwo?
__label__pl	Piją piwo.
__label__pl	Zamówiłem piwo.
__label__pl	Pije pan piwo?
__label__pl	Napije się pan piwa?
__label__pl	Tom otworzył piwo.
__label__pl	Ubiegam się o pracę.
__label__pl	Mapa wisi na ścianie.
__label__pl	To była moja kolej.
__label__pl	Sami czekał na przystanku autobusowym.
__label__pl	Kurs zaczyna się o dziesiątej.
__label__pl	Jezioro jest w tym miejscu głębokie.
__label__pl	Niech pan skręci w lewo na następnym rogu!
__label__pl	On chce wziąć udział w zawodach.
__label__pl	Podoba mi się wasze miasto.
__label__pl	Tom opuścił miasto.
__label__pl	Pochodzę z miasta.
__label__pl	Nie lubię zwiedzać dużych miast.
__label__pl	Mieszkam w dużym mieście.
__label__pl	Jestem nowy w mieście.
__label__pl	Chodźmy do miasta!
__label__pl	To jest główna ulica miasta.
__label__pl	Nara to spokojne i piękne miasto.
__label__pl	W każdym amerykańskim mieście jest biblioteka.
__label__pl	W środku miasta wybuchł pożar.
__label__pl	Tu są noże, widelce i łyżki.
__label__pl	Przejdź przez ulicę.
__label__pl	Przeszedłem przez ulicę.
__label__pl	Upuściłem jabłko.
__label__pl	Lubię pomarańcze bardziej niż jabłka.
__label__pl	On pije sok.
__label__pl	Szkło jest przezroczyste.
__label__pl	Tom podniósł swój kieliszek.
__label__pl	Pamiętam Toma.
__label__pl	Nie potrafię sobie przypomnieć tekstu.
__label__pl	Wierzę w cud.
__label__pl	Wierzę w magię.
__label__pl	Zawsze noszę krawat do pracy.
__label__pl	Ty i ja zawsze będziemy przyjaciółmi.
__label__pl	Tom zawsze to robi, kiedy jest w Bostonie.
__label__pl	Zawsze jestem gotów ci pomóc.
__label__pl	Dlaczego zawsze jesteś taki skryty?
__label__pl	Dlaczego te drzwi są zawsze zamknięte?
__label__pl	Zawsze rozmawiam z Tomem po francusku.
__label__pl	Zawsze jeżdżę autobusem.
__label__pl	Zawsze pracuję.
__label__pl	Tom zawsze je lunch sam przy biurku.
__label__pl	Ona jest zawsze wesoła.
__label__pl	Tom zawsze wstawał wcześnie.

__label__pl	Zawsze o tym myślę.
__label__pl	Zawsze chciałem zwierzaka.
__label__pl	Tom zawsze wygląda na chorego.
__label__pl	Tom zawsze nosi ten sam kapelusz.
__label__pl	Mój pokój jest zawsze czysty.
__label__pl	Nie oszczędzaj kosztem swojego zdrowia.
__label__pl	Lubię bułki z chrupiącą skórką.
__label__pl	Zjedz lepiej kilka chrupiących bułeczek zamiast chipsów ziemniaczanych!
__label__pl	Maria siedziała na brzegu łóżka.
__label__pl	Tom usiadł na brzegu łóżka.
__label__pl	Postanowiłem inaczej.
__label__pl	Usmaż mi jajko.
__label__pl	Potrzebuję to dzisiaj.
__label__pl	Idź i zobacz!
__label__pl	Czy to jest plan?
__label__pl	To jest całkiem nowa książka.
__label__pl	Spotkałeś go?
__label__pl	Tom pije wodę.
__label__pl	Widziałem to w telewizji.
__label__pl	Możesz oglądać telewizję.
__label__pl	Widziałem Toma w telewizji.
__label__pl	Wyłączcie telewizor.
__label__pl	Możecie oglądać telewizję.
__label__pl	Proszę wyłącz telewizor.
__label__pl	Może pan oglądać telewizję.
__label__pl	Włącz telewizor.
__label__pl	Oglądam.
__label__pl	Nie patrz w dół!
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie idziesz do kina?
__label__pl	Co jakiś czas chodzimy razem do kina.
__label__pl	Sporadycznie.
__label__pl	Myślę o tym od czasu do czasu.
__label__pl	Od czasu do czasu pracuję dla Toma.
__label__pl	Zbudowano go ponad 500 lat temu.
__label__pl	Czy na zewnątrz jest zimno?
__label__pl	Nie mam dowodu.
__label__pl	Musiałem to zaakceptować.
__label__pl	Nie możemy teraz przestać.
__label__pl	Czy możesz mi powiedzieć dlaczego?
__label__pl	Nienawidzę pustyni.
__label__pl	Lubię tu pracować.
__label__pl	Potrafię śpiewać.
__label__pl	Rzadko piję piwo.
__label__pl	Niebezpieczeństwo minęło.
__label__pl	Nacisnął guzik i czekał.
__label__pl	Tom prawdopodobnie nie ma z tym problemu.
__label__pl	Czyja to herbata?
__label__pl	Ta herbata nie jest dla mnie wystarczająco słodka.
__label__pl	Herbata jest ciepła.
__label__pl	Lubię tę herbatę.
__label__pl	Dzięki za herbatę!
__label__pl	Ta herbata jest bardzo gorąca.
__label__pl	Lubi pan herbatę?
__label__pl	Nie ma cukru.
__label__pl	Kupiłem kilka jajek i trochę mleka.
__label__pl	Zabrakło nam mleka.
__label__pl	Ta wołowina jest delikatna.
__label__pl	Tom mieszka w Rzymie.
__label__pl	Reszta jest dla ciebie.
__label__pl	On znajduje się w pobliżu kościoła.
__label__pl	On mieszka tutaj.
__label__pl	Mamy dziobaka.
__label__pl	Policjant oddał strzał ostrzegawczy.
__label__pl	Nie wiem, kiedy Tom tu dotrze, ale prawdopodobnie jutro po południu.
__label__pl	Mieliśmy wobec Toma wysokie oczekiwania.
__label__pl	Z tego, że lubi malować, nie wynika, że maluje dobrze.
__label__pl	Tom nic nie powie Mary.
__label__pl	Chciał(a)bym wiedzieć, dlaczego nie lubisz Toma.
__label__pl	Okłamałeś Toma.
__label__pl	Spieszył się, żeby złapać autobus.
__label__pl	Osoba, od której dostaniesz list, jest teraz na urlopie.
__label__pl	Co robią mężczyźni?
__label__pl	Nic nie widział(e/a)ś?
__label__pl	Moi rodzice są nauczycielami.
__label__pl	On nie mówi w wielu językach.
__label__pl	Kto zna rosyjski?
__label__pl	Czemu Tom nie wzywał pomocy?
__label__pl	Czy duchy mają cienie?
__label__pl	Myślał(e/a)ś, że nie zauważę?
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że nie mamy czasu.
__label__pl	To dla nas bardzo ważny dzień.
__label__pl	Zwykle budzę się o świcie.
__label__pl	Tom może to zmienić.
__label__pl	Czemu po prostu nie przeczytasz instrukcji?
__label__pl	Tom jest zegarmistrzem.
__label__pl	Sami uważa, że kobiety w islamie są uciskane.
__label__pl	Nie musisz teraz tego robić.
__label__pl	Popatrzył podejrzliwie na wysokiego mężczyznę.
__label__pl	Sami rzucił dziewczynę.
__label__pl	Sami popełnił duży błąd.
__label__pl	Wydaje mi się, że mam wiele do zaoferowania.
__label__pl	Przetłumaczyłem list na francuski.
__label__pl	Nie wydaje mi się, żeby Tom był w stanie to zrobić.
__label__pl	Nie jem meksykańskiego jedzenia tak często, jak Tom.
__label__pl	Mary usłyszała za sobą głośny plusk.
__label__pl	Myślisz, że Tom i Mary byli zadowoleni?
__label__pl	Wiem, że to Tom powinien był powiedzieć Mary, że nie musiała tego robić.
__label__pl	Wyglądasz na smutnego/smutną.
__label__pl	Psy były szczęśliwe.
__label__pl	Nie jestem pewien, czy to się wydarzy.
__label__pl	Prawdopodobnie nie powiedzie mu się.
__label__pl	Nigdy nie byłem w Kagoshimie, ale zamierzam się tam wybrać tego lata.
__label__pl	To był kiedyś gabinet Toma.
__label__pl	Jestem naprawdę dumna ze swoich studentów.
__label__pl	Nigdy nie powinien był tego robić.
__label__pl	Mary jest wybredna w kwestii ubrań.
__label__pl	Przepraszam panią.
__label__pl	To co dokładnie się stało?
__label__pl	To, co zobaczyła Mary, zdenerwowało ją.
__label__pl	Tomowi trzeba zapłacić.
__label__pl	Tom wrócił z Australii o tydzień wcześniej, niż spodziewaliśmy się.
__label__pl	Mówili, że wrócą do domu na obiad.
__label__pl	Arabia Saudyjska i Iran nie ufają sobie nawzajem.
__label__pl	Rodzina Esthery to jemeńscy Żydzi.
__label__pl	Pierwsza połowa filmu była wciągająca, ale zakończenie było rozczarowujące.
__label__pl	Połowa bólu depliacji piersi to oczekiwanie.
__label__pl	Powoli spuścił sprzęgło i odjechał.
__label__pl	Dwumetrowy żywy krokodyl został znaleziony w ogrodowej szklarni w trzecim największym mieście Szwecji, Malmö.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy kim jesteśmy.
__label__pl	Kto ci powiedział o mnie?
__label__pl	Myślę, że Tom wciąż tęskni za domem.
__label__pl	Myślę, że Tom zrobił to specjalnie.
__label__pl	Chciałbym być tak bogaty, jak Tom.
__label__pl	Nie wydaje mi się, żeby była podobna do matki.
__label__pl	Prezydent przełożył wizytę do Japonii.
__label__pl	Ten pociąg jedzie do Nowego Jorku.
__label__pl	Trochę jest jej go żal.
__label__pl	Oboje wychowali się w Algierze.
__label__pl	Zastanawiam się, co powinniśmy teraz zrobić.
__label__pl	Sami znowu zaczął pisać wiadomości do Layli.
__label__pl	Sami i Layla rozmawiają od dłuższego czasu.
__label__pl	Mary mówi, że chce, żebym pojechał z Tomem do Bostonu.
__label__pl	Przebaczysz mi?
__label__pl	Tom i Mary wachlują się.
__label__pl	Sami patrzył na to ze swojego samochodu.
__label__pl	Tom dał nam znać że nie chce tego robić.
__label__pl	Masz starszych braci?
__label__pl	Kończą mu się pieniądze, prawda?
__label__pl	Biskup zlitował się nad zdesperowanymi imigrantami.
__label__pl	To są moje walizki.
__label__pl	Jesteś pewien, że Tom może to zrobić?
__label__pl	Jesteś pewien, że Tomowi się to uda?
__label__pl	I co teraz uważasz na ten temat?
__label__pl	Miałem nadzieję, że Tom da radę nauczyć się, jak to zrobić.
__label__pl	Tom przyjechał w poniedziałek.
__label__pl	Lubię twojego kota, ale on nie lubi mnie.
__label__pl	Nie dosłyszałem ostatniego słowa.
__label__pl	Teraz przedstawię cię swoim rodzicom.
__label__pl	Dziś jest dzień na pranie.
__label__pl	Ona może wrócić.
__label__pl	Otworzyłem drzwi i wyciągnąłem Toma z samochodu.
__label__pl	Powietrze jest lżejsze od wody.
__label__pl	Tom, przyjacielu, wiem że mnie kochałeś, ale nie mogłam być twoja.
__label__pl	Przypuszczam że chcesz mnie spytać, gdzie byłem.
__label__pl	Nie masz broni, prawda?
__label__pl	Źle go oceniłem.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary szli blisko przy sobie.
__label__pl	To jest ta książka, o której rozmawialiśmy z Tomem.
__label__pl	Na mojej liście są jeszcze trzy rzeczy, które musze kupić.
__label__pl	Pierwszy mąż Joséphiny został ścięty podczas Rewolucji Francuskiej.
__label__pl	Jak używa się tej karty?
__label__pl	Co? Nadal nie umiesz prowadzić auta?
__label__pl	Genialne!
__label__pl	Wiem, co Tom próbował zrobić.
__label__pl	Niszczy swoje ubrania.
__label__pl	Tom miał zły dzień w pracy.
__label__pl	Tom rozumie sprawy zagraniczne.
__label__pl	Tom pewnie ciągle się boi.
__label__pl	Tom o tym nie mówił.
__label__pl	Tom planował kogoś zabić.
__label__pl	Sheyna, siostra Beyle, mieszka w Białymstoku.
__label__pl	Powiedział, że boi się tam iść.
__label__pl	Mam nadzieję, że zrozumiecie.
__label__pl	Byłaś bardzo zajęta, prawda?
__label__pl	Tom złamał prawe ramię.
__label__pl	Jeśli gospodarka wkrótce nie przyspieszy, będziemy musieli zacisnąć pasa.
__label__pl	Ocenay pokrywają 70% powierzchni Ziemi.
__label__pl	Nie da się stwierdzić, w co on tak naprawdę wierzy.
__label__pl	Zdecydowanie chcę pomóc.
__label__pl	Tom zrobił to, by przetrwać.
__label__pl	Jesteś bardzo chory.
__label__pl	Trzeba wziąć pod uwagę wiele czynników.
__label__pl	Dowiemy się, jak to zrobić.
__label__pl	Poszukam jej.
__label__pl	Być może będziemy musieli/musiały zrobić więcej.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że wolałby umrzeć, niż to zrobić.
__label__pl	Tom nigdy nie spróbowałby tego robić.
__label__pl	Tom i Maria raczej nie powiedzą Johnowi, że chcieliby to zrobić.
__label__pl	Tom i Maria to kłamcy.
__label__pl	Wiem, wiem.
__label__pl	Obiecała, że będzie mówić po francusku.
__label__pl	Głośniej!
__label__pl	Czemu myślisz, że Tom i Maria planują się rozwieźć?
__label__pl	Woda płynie pod mostem.
__label__pl	Przynajmniej tyle mogę zrobić.
__label__pl	Miałem szansę to kupić, ale nie zdecydowałem się.
__label__pl	Nie obchodzi mnie, co się stanie, i tak zamierzam powiedzieć twoim rodzicom.
__label__pl	Już to przerabialiśmy.
__label__pl	Tom zawsze kładzie się przed północą.
__label__pl	Maria wie, że mi się podoba.
__label__pl	Jest przy swoim biurku.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że chce mówić z menedżerem.
__label__pl	Jest kreatywna, prawda?
__label__pl	Dam sobie radę.
__label__pl	Nasz pociąg odjeżdża o wpół do dziewiątej.
__label__pl	Co było dla ciebie przełomem?
__label__pl	Czy wy wciąż utrzymujecie kontakt?
__label__pl	Podobają mu się pulchne dziewczyny.
__label__pl	Bardzo martwię się o środowisko.
__label__pl	Jest pochmurno, ale nie pada.
__label__pl	W zeszłym miesiącu nasza dwudziestopięcioletnia córka urodziła dziewczynkę.
__label__pl	Czułem się, jakbym nie miał wyboru.
__label__pl	Chciał(a)bym wiedzieć, ile będę musiał(a) zapłacić.
__label__pl	Jesteś zadowolony z wyniku?
__label__pl	Susza, ubóstwo i bezrobocie napędzały emigrację z Mauretanii od lat siedemdziesiątych.
__label__pl	Tom nie wie jak robić zdjęcia.
__label__pl	Czy ktoś może wyjaśnić, co się tu dzieje?
__label__pl	Fizyka to podstawowa nauka przyrodnicza.
__label__pl	Uczęszczam na konferencje naukowe.
__label__pl	Kreacjonizm to pseudo-nauka.
__label__pl	Pogoda jest prognozowana naukowo.
__label__pl	Nauka odmieniła nasze życia.
__label__pl	Te twierdzenia nie mają naukowych podstaw.
__label__pl	Małe dzieci często fascynują się nauką.
__label__pl	W ostatnich latach, nauka dokonała nadzwyczajnego postępu.
__label__pl	On jest jednym z największych naukowców na świecie.
__label__pl	Naukowcy jeszcze nie umieją uleczyć raka.
__label__pl	Nigdy nie zostaniesz informatykiem.
__label__pl	Jej ojciec poświęcił całe życie nauce.
__label__pl	Komisja składa się z naukowców i inżynierów.
__label__pl	Niektórzy naukowcy wierzą, że efekt cieplarniany jest zmyślony.
__label__pl	Nowoczesna technologia uczyniła nasze życia wygodniejszymi.
__label__pl	Obietnic należy dotrzymywać.
__label__pl	Przyszedłem ostrzec cię przed tym, co się stanie.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy teraz bardzo zajęci.
__label__pl	Przyszedłem kilka minut za wcześnie.
__label__pl	Tom wyraźnie nie chce tego robić.
__label__pl	Nie wydaje mi się, żeby Tom był przyjazny.
__label__pl	Zdecydowałem się sprzedać samochód.
__label__pl	Nie chcę, żebyś spotykała się z Tomem.
__label__pl	Tom wyraźnie się czymś martwi.
__label__pl	Musieliśmy/musiałyśmy to zrobić.
__label__pl	Wiedziałeś, że Tom zaczął grać na gitarze dopiero kiedy miał trzydzieści lat?
__label__pl	Tom wyprowadził się tej wiosny od rodziców i od tego czasu mieszka sam.
__label__pl	Powiedziałeś Tomowi, skąd jesteś?
__label__pl	Tom i Maria oboje znowu to zrobili.
__label__pl	Tak naprawdę nie martwię się aż tak o pogodę.
__label__pl	Przestanę ci przerywać.
__label__pl	Przestanę ci przeszkadzać.
__label__pl	Rosja jest wielka.
__label__pl	Nie wydaje mi się, żeby Tom zamierzał to robić, gdy nie miał ochoty.
__label__pl	Nie chcę, żebyś pomyślał, że jestem niezadowolony z twojej decyzji.
__label__pl	Po co ktoś miałby porywać Toma?
__label__pl	Potrzebuję tego na najwcześniej jak to tylko możliwe.
__label__pl	Przyjaciele Toma próbowali mu pomóc.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział że myślał że Maria jeszcze nie śpi.
__label__pl	Nie aresztują Toma, prawda?
__label__pl	Chcę pokazać ci inny sposób na zrobienie tego.
__label__pl	Tom jest byłym studentem Marii.
__label__pl	Tom gra na pianinie i śpiewa.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział że myślał że Maria jest zawstydzona.
__label__pl	Wiem, że Tom nigdy by cię nie okłamał.
__label__pl	Tom jest raczej opryskliwy.
__label__pl	Zaprosiłem Toma na obiad.
__label__pl	Jesteś dużo niższy od Toma, prawda?
__label__pl	Pozostawienie dzieci samych było czystą bezmyślnością.
__label__pl	Tom pisze lewą ręką.
__label__pl	Tomowi spodoba się Boston.
__label__pl	W tamtych czasach w Ameryce Północnej było niewiele dróg.
__label__pl	Wiesz, że w końcu wszyscy się o tym dowiedzą.
__label__pl	Jak można sprawić, by to się więcej nie wydarzyło?
__label__pl	Mógłbyś robić to gdzieś indziej?
__label__pl	Myślałem, że Tom więcej tego nie zrobi.
__label__pl	Wszystko było przykryte kurzem.
__label__pl	Czemu ważne jest poznanie kultury firmy?
__label__pl	Skrytykował mnie za zaniedbywanie obowiązku.
__label__pl	Obserwują mnie.
__label__pl	Spróbuj go przekonać, żeby nam pomógł.
__label__pl	Tom prawie nie mówił.
__label__pl	Zawsze podejrzewałem, że mogłeś trenować kiedyś karate.
__label__pl	Powiedzieli/powiedziały, że zrobiliby/zrobiłyby dla nas wszystko.
__label__pl	Wiemy, że Tom został zastrzelony. Nic więcej nie wiemy.
__label__pl	Idź włóż piżamę.
__label__pl	Kup mi komputer.
__label__pl	Uczenie się języka obcego może być zabawą.
__label__pl	Nie zgodził się na małżeństwo swojej córki.
__label__pl	Algieria jest niepodległym państwem od 1962-go roku.
__label__pl	Jesteś mi winien prawdę.
__label__pl	Ty nigdy się nie poddajesz, prawda?
__label__pl	Wierzymy mu.
__label__pl	Nie miałem pojęcia, że Tom umie mówić po francusku.
__label__pl	Nie miałem pojęcia, że Tom zna francuski.
__label__pl	Wstrzymał(e/a)m oddech i oczekiwał(e/am).
__label__pl	Tom zapomniał napisać do Marii.
__label__pl	Pogrzeb był wczoraj.
__label__pl	Mogę się tobą zająć.
__label__pl	Ona będzie miała rację.
__label__pl	Bardzo mi to smakuje.
__label__pl	Do czego jeszcze Tomek jest zdolny?
__label__pl	Niedawno kupiłem słownik.
__label__pl	Zostaniesz pociągnięty do odpowiedzialności.
__label__pl	Czy Tom jest nadal zły?
__label__pl	Miałem nic złego na myśli.
__label__pl	Wojna jest zła.
__label__pl	Jestem w złym nastroju.
__label__pl	Teraz czuję się źle.
__label__pl	To zła inwestycja.
__label__pl	Źle się dzisiaj czuję.
__label__pl	Dziś czuję się gorzej.
__label__pl	Tom jest złym kucharzem.
__label__pl	Czuję się bardzo źle.
__label__pl	Jak długo Tom był chory?
__label__pl	Myślę, że Tom jest chory.
__label__pl	Mam nadzieję, że Tom nie jest chory.
__label__pl	Na zewnątrz stoi policjant.
__label__pl	Czy ktoś jest na zewnątrz?
__label__pl	Cały dzień byłem na zewnątrz.
__label__pl	Wszedłem do domu.
__label__pl	Powinienem zacząć się pakować.
__label__pl	Pomogę ci się spakować.
__label__pl	Muszę jeszcze spakować walizki.
__label__pl	Wygląda pan na zdenerwowanego.
__label__pl	Czy to jest na sprzedaż?
__label__pl	Moja mama jest ze mnie dumna.
__label__pl	Moja siostra pięknie śpiewa.
__label__pl	Tom potrafił czytać jeszcze przed rozpoczęciem szkoły.
__label__pl	Moja siostrzenica jest opiekunką.
__label__pl	Ta opiekunka jest bardzo miła i uprzejma.
__label__pl	Opiekunka mojej babci jest bardzo miła.
__label__pl	Jego córka jest opiekunką.
__label__pl	Mój siostrzeniec jest opiekunem.
__label__pl	Tom potrzebuje stałej opieki.
__label__pl	Musimy pomyśleć o opiece nad osobami starszymi.
__label__pl	Zawsze po obiedzie jem awokado.
__label__pl	Awokado jest bogate w składniki odżywcze.
__label__pl	Chciałbyś dodać awokado do sałatki?
__label__pl	Chciałbym zjeść mango.
__label__pl	To mango jest bardzo słodkie.
__label__pl	Nigdy jeszcze nie jadłem mango.
__label__pl	Ta dynia pachnie melonem.
__label__pl	Mój brzuch jest gruby jak melon.
__label__pl	Moja dynia była najlepsza.
__label__pl	Pomożemy.
__label__pl	Oni przyjdą znowu.
__label__pl	Oni wrócą.
__label__pl	Wprowadzimy się.
__label__pl	Obejrzę telewizję.
__label__pl	Gdzie będziemy jeść?
__label__pl	Niedługo się przeprowadzę.
__label__pl	Pan się zgubi.
__label__pl	Pospieszymy się.
__label__pl	Tom musi zostać zoperowany.
__label__pl	Co je na stole?
__label__pl	Tom nigdy nie pozwoliłby ci tego zrobić.
__label__pl	Potrzebuję pary nożyczek do cięcia tego papieru.
__label__pl	Sami i Layla rozmawiają i śmieją się.
__label__pl	Zmieniłem pracę.
__label__pl	Twój ojciec miał rację.
__label__pl	Dobry kot!
__label__pl	Czekanie jest nudne.
__label__pl	Czy koty śnią?
__label__pl	Znajdź kota.
__label__pl	Kot!
__label__pl	Kot miauknął.
__label__pl	Kot zamiauczał.
__label__pl	Tom nie znosi kotów.
__label__pl	Tom nienawidzi kotów.
__label__pl	Kot uciekł.
__label__pl	Mike lubi koty.
__label__pl	Susan lubi koty.
__label__pl	Koty zabijają szczury.
__label__pl	Koty lubią pudełka.
__label__pl	Kot je chleb.
__label__pl	Kot zjada chleb.
__label__pl	Psy nienawidzą kotów.
__label__pl	Koty lubią sznurki.
__label__pl	Co jedzą rekiny?
__label__pl	Kot śpi.
__label__pl	Patrz! Kot.
__label__pl	Koty są wspaniałe.
__label__pl	Masz koty?
__label__pl	On nie cierpi kotów.
__label__pl	Koty są magiczne.
__label__pl	Patrz na kota.
__label__pl	Kim jest buddysta?
__label__pl	Pod stołem jest kosz.
__label__pl	Jutro będzie grał w piłkę nożną.
__label__pl	Ta historia mocno nim wstrząsnęła.
__label__pl	Zabiłeś go?
__label__pl	Zabiłaś go?
__label__pl	Nic się nie zmienia.
__label__pl	Tom nie narzekał.
__label__pl	Koty potrzebują miłości.
__label__pl	Wszędzie kocia sierść!
__label__pl	Koty są wybredne.
__label__pl	Koty lubią kocimiętkę.
__label__pl	Na pewno nie potrzebujesz pomocy?
__label__pl	Nie mogę pozwolić, żeby cię złapali.
__label__pl	Kocha koty.
__label__pl	Młode tygrysy przypominają koty.
__label__pl	Zrobię ci kanapki!
__label__pl	We wczorajszym meczu Waseda zremisowała z Keio.
__label__pl	Ostatecznie ich kłótnia zakończyła się remisem.
__label__pl	No.
__label__pl	Tak, czasami.
__label__pl	Tom jest teraz w szpitalu.
__label__pl	Nie mogę być częścią tego.
__label__pl	Znowu ją zastępuję.
__label__pl	Znowu go zastępuję.
__label__pl	Ten ryż jest pyszny.
__label__pl	Mówią, że wciąż robią to często.
__label__pl	Zostawił swoją torbę w pociągu.
__label__pl	Sami nie jest moim ojcem.
__label__pl	Nie możesz tego robić bez pozwolenia, prawda?
__label__pl	Nie możecie tego robić bez pozwolenia, prawda?
__label__pl	Mary zrobiła to dla swoich dzieci.
__label__pl	Mary robiła to dla swoich dzieci.
__label__pl	Marzenia nigdy nie umierają.
__label__pl	Wszyscy inni poszli.
__label__pl	Muszę nakarmić mojego psa.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy same?
__label__pl	Jesteśmy sami?
__label__pl	Ja po prostu chcę urlop.
__label__pl	Ten pociąg zmierza do Tokyo.
__label__pl	Astronauci NASA Robert Behnken i Douglas Hurley na pokładzie SpaceX Dragon Endeavour dotarli na Międzynarodową Stację Kosmiczną.
__label__pl	Algierczycy nie mogą stracić pracy. Muszą karmić swoje dzieci.
__label__pl	Chociaż słuchałem ale niczego nie usłyszałem
__label__pl	Wcale się nie ukrywam.
__label__pl	Przez pół godziny staliśmy i rozmawialiśmy.
__label__pl	Nigdy nie zapomnę, co Tom mi zrobił.
__label__pl	Weekendy zwykle spędzam w domu.
__label__pl	Tom nie marnuje czasu.
__label__pl	Ochronię Toma.
__label__pl	Obronię Toma.
__label__pl	Nie powinienem ufać komuś takiemu jak Tom.
__label__pl	Dom Toma został przeszukany przez policję.
__label__pl	Tom wrócił do domu pijany po imprezie.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary mieszkają na ranczu i mają troje dzieci.
__label__pl	Rzadko śpię w samolocie.
__label__pl	Sami uciekł do domu swojej matki.
__label__pl	Czy twój francuski się polepsza?
__label__pl	Tom był bardzo nieśmiały i nerwowy.
__label__pl	Tom był właścicielem sklepu z dywanami na Park Street.
__label__pl	Posprzątaj to, Tom.
__label__pl	Tom otworzył usta, żeby przerwać.
__label__pl	Myślałem, że to było zabawne.
__label__pl	Jim pracuje nad swoim samochodem.
__label__pl	Ona chciała, żeby on zaprosił ją na swoją imprezę.
__label__pl	Tom stał tuż za mną.
__label__pl	Jestem pastorem.
__label__pl	Te ołówki są moje.
__label__pl	Ona towarzyszy mi na każdej wycieczce.
__label__pl	Ona towarzyszy mi na każdym wyjeździe.
__label__pl	Tom ukończył szkołę w tym samym roku co Mary.
__label__pl	Co jest, kurwa?
__label__pl	Piekło jest puste, a wszystkie diabły są tutaj.
__label__pl	Słyszał muzykę.
__label__pl	Czy boli pana gardło?
__label__pl	My mamy zaletę.
__label__pl	Czy ten ołówek jest twój?
__label__pl	Ona jest młodsza od niego.
__label__pl	Ona jest młoda.
__label__pl	Jestem jeszcze młody.
__label__pl	Wyglądał młodo.
__label__pl	Ile lat ma twoja siostra?
__label__pl	To drzewo jest stare.
__label__pl	Mam trzydzieści lat.
__label__pl	Nie ma jej w tej chwili w domu.
__label__pl	Właśnie wychodzę.
__label__pl	Gdzie jesteśmy w tej chwili.
__label__pl	Muszę nakarmić mojego kota.
__label__pl	Ile macie kotów?
__label__pl	Mieszkasz tu sam?
__label__pl	Powiedz mi, że mnie kochasz!
__label__pl	Tom nie lubi wieprzowiny.
__label__pl	Nigdzie ich nie widzę.
__label__pl	Nigdzie jej nie widzę.
__label__pl	Spotkała go w kawiarni.
__label__pl	Poznała go w kawiarni.
__label__pl	Myślisz, że to zabawne?
__label__pl	To będzie znowu gorący dzień.
__label__pl	Było nieznośnie gorąco.
__label__pl	Dziś jest gorący dzień.
__label__pl	Jest bardzo gorąco.
__label__pl	Piekarnik jest gorący.
__label__pl	To był bardzo gorący wieczór.
__label__pl	Czy tam jest gorąco?
__label__pl	Zupa jest gorąca.
__label__pl	Ta zupa jest gorąca.
__label__pl	Staraj się nie upaść.
__label__pl	Wolałbym nic nie ryzykować.
__label__pl	On je powoli.
__label__pl	Jak mam to ustawić?
__label__pl	Jak to ustawić ?
__label__pl	Jak mam to zmierzyć?
__label__pl	Nie wiem jak to zmierzyć.
__label__pl	Gdzie mam tego szukać?
__label__pl	Nie znam się na tym.
__label__pl	Czy tam pada?
__label__pl	Do której leci ten film?
__label__pl	Pracuję na nocną zmianę.
__label__pl	Wpadnij kiedyś pograć na konsoli.
__label__pl	Zjadłem dwa pączki.
__label__pl	Długo już tu pracujesz?
__label__pl	Chciałbym mu pomóc, jeśli mogę.
__label__pl	Chciałabym mu pomóc, jeśli mogę.
__label__pl	Naprawdę chcę piwo.
__label__pl	Tom chodzi do tej samej szkoły co ja.
__label__pl	Granicę więzienia wyznacza duży płot.
__label__pl	Pielęgniarka ubiera się na biało.
__label__pl	Czy znasz dziewczynę z portretu?
__label__pl	Tom już zdecydował, z kim pójść.
__label__pl	Kobiety są najpiękniejszą częścią życia mężczyzny.
__label__pl	Jestem zwyczajnym pracownikiem biurowym.
__label__pl	Durian to owoc, za którym nie przepadam.
__label__pl	Spójrz na załączoną stronę.
__label__pl	Golf to sport, którego nie lubię.
__label__pl	Co powiesz na 20 października o 14:30?
__label__pl	Mecz został przełożony na następny poniedziałek.
__label__pl	Czy podwieziesz mnie na stację?
__label__pl	Poćwiczmy.
__label__pl	Czy mam ci wyjaśnić jak to działa?
__label__pl	Ma tylko słomę w głowie.
__label__pl	Jest głupi jak snopek słomy.
__label__pl	Koń leżał na słomie.
__label__pl	Ten dach jest ze słomy.
__label__pl	Czy siano już wyschło?
__label__pl	Siano jest dla koni.
__label__pl	Nie wszystkie zwierzęta jedzą siano.
__label__pl	Na dole jest dość siana.
__label__pl	Jutro musimy zgrabić siano.
__label__pl	Przechowywaliśmy siano w stodole.
__label__pl	Sianot rzeba zbierać, gdy świeci słońce.
__label__pl	Musimy jeszcze przewrócić siano i narąbać drewna.
__label__pl	Zima jest mroźna.
__label__pl	Powinienem iść do szkoły.
__label__pl	Kopie własny grób.
__label__pl	Co ona z tobą zrobiła?
__label__pl	Czy mógł bym z tobą chwilę porozmawiać w cztery oczy?
__label__pl	Nie wiem, co teraz powinienem zrobić.
__label__pl	Udawajmy, jakbyśmy tego nie usłyszeli.
__label__pl	Zawsze kiedy cię widzę, myślę o twojej matce.
__label__pl	Już raz tu byłem.
__label__pl	To w niej kocham.
__label__pl	Co jest z tym nie tak?
__label__pl	To jest dla przyjaciela ode mnie.
__label__pl	To w ogóle nie stało się w ten sposób.
__label__pl	Już słyszałem tą historię.
__label__pl	Czego oni właściwie chcą?
__label__pl	Kto to zrobi?
__label__pl	Powinienem iść z tobą?
__label__pl	To było naprawdę dobre.
__label__pl	Muszę teraz odejść.
__label__pl	Dziękuję państwu.
__label__pl	Wszyscy się przyglądają.
__label__pl	Dzisiaj nie ma nic do zrobienia.
__label__pl	Muszę to wiedzieć.
__label__pl	To był czas żeby iść.
__label__pl	Znany lekarz.
__label__pl	W Japonii spis ludności przeprowadza się co pięć lat.
__label__pl	Do ciebie czy do mnie?
__label__pl	Ja jestem.
__label__pl	On jeszcze tego nie wie.
__label__pl	Ma pan jakiś?

__label__pl	Tom ma obsesję.
__label__pl	Jest opętana przez diabła.
__label__pl	Pracuje jak opętany.
__label__pl	Tom wierzy w wróżki.

__label__pl	Słyszałem, że tu przyszła.
__label__pl	W tym mieście nie żyje się dobrze.
__label__pl	Nie jedźmy.
__label__pl	Nie idźmy.
__label__pl	Tom wsiadł do ciężarówki i odjechał.
__label__pl	Długopis jest na stole.
__label__pl	Nie ma sensu na niego czekać.
__label__pl	On uczy się w łazience.
__label__pl	Światło zachowuje się albo jak fala, albo jak wiązka cząsteczek.

__label__pl	Co jej powiedziałeś?
__label__pl	Co jej powiedziałaś?
__label__pl	Co musimy zrobić dziś wieczorem?
__label__pl	Muszę zdecydować, co zrobić.
__label__pl	Popcorn jest moją ulubioną przekąską.
__label__pl	Tamta dziewczynka niosła kilka książek. Nie były to podręczniki, a grube książki w twardych okładkach.
__label__pl	Błagam, nie mów mamie!
__label__pl	Mam wolne w niedzielę.
__label__pl	Czemu nic nie powiedziała?

__label__pl	Byłem zszokowany.
__label__pl	Byłem zaskoczony.
__label__pl	Mary nie jest szczęśliwa, że tu jest, prawda?
__label__pl	Podejrzewam, że Tom i Mary nie muszą już tego robić.
__label__pl	To są nożyczki, które pożyczył mi Tom.
__label__pl	To był jego pierwszy kontakt z Islamem.
__label__pl	Sami rozpoznał małą dziewczynkę, która była w ramieniu Layli.
__label__pl	Mówisz, że myślisz, że mogę to zrobić?
__label__pl	Tom ograniczył spożycie słodyczy.
__label__pl	Czy nie ma żadnej alternatywy dla tego, co proponujesz?
__label__pl	Tom powiedział mi, że myślał, że Mary jest szalona.
__label__pl	Zawsze, gdy wraca z podróży, przywozi córce prezent.

__label__pl	Możesz poprosić Toma o pomoc.
__label__pl	Poprosiłeś nas o pomoc.
__label__pl	Czy mogę liczyć na pana pomoc?

__label__pl	Wyruszamy za pół godziny.
__label__pl	Czy szklanka jest w połowie pełna czy w połowie pusta?
__label__pl	Nie spóźnij się do szkoły.
__label__pl	On jest zabójcą.
__label__pl	Kiedy przeszedł na islam, stał się dość religijny.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary nie zrobili tego razem.
__label__pl	Mój dom ma niebieski dach.
__label__pl	Nikt, kogo znam, nie chce tego robić.
__label__pl	Nikt, kogo znam, nie chce tego zrobić.
__label__pl	Mieliśmy problemy z Tomem.
__label__pl	Czemu pociąg się spóźnia?
__label__pl	Będzie lało.
__label__pl	Moment...
__label__pl	Idź sobie!
__label__pl	Zaczęło lać jak z cebra.

__label__pl	Mogę cię zaprosić na kolację?
__label__pl	Zaprosiłam Toma do siebie.
__label__pl	Zaprosiłem Toma do domu.
__label__pl	Umówił się ze mną na sobotę.
__label__pl	Umówiła się ze mną na sobotę.
__label__pl	Obiad stygnie.
__label__pl	Rzadko się gniewa.
__label__pl	Rozzłościła się.
__label__pl	Zezłościła się.
__label__pl	Zestarzała się.
__label__pl	Czy ja oszalałem?
__label__pl	Czy ja oszalałam?

__label__pl	Jestem obywatelką USA.
__label__pl	Layla jest fantastyczną kucharką.
__label__pl	Przyszedłem porozmawiać o niej.

__label__pl	Chodźmy do lasu!
__label__pl	Nie możemy przegrać.
__label__pl	Zamknij drzwi! Ciągnie.
__label__pl	Tom wyciągnął pistolet.

__label__pl	Statek zmienił kurs.
__label__pl	Tom będzie cierpieć.
__label__pl	Wyślij to do mnie.
__label__pl	Usiedliśmy z przodu.
__label__pl	Obwinili Toma za porażkę
__label__pl	Był jasny, zimny dzień kwietniowy i zegary biły trzynastą.
__label__pl	Nie możemy ich tak po prostu zwolnić.
__label__pl	Nie możemy ich tak po prostu wylać.
__label__pl	Nie możemy ich tak po prostu wywalić.
__label__pl	Moim marzeniem jest nauka mandaryńskiego w Pekinie.

__label__pl	Woda jest letnia.
__label__pl	Kawa jest tylko letnia.
__label__pl	Nie lubię letniej kawy.
__label__pl	Zupa jest niestety tylko letnia.
__label__pl	Woda była letnia.
__label__pl	Umyj twarz letnią wodą i mydłem.
__label__pl	Dlaczego mnie dręczysz?
__label__pl	Dlaczego chcesz umrzeć?
__label__pl	Dlaczego się wycofałeś?
__label__pl	Dlaczego temu zaprzeczasz?
__label__pl	Będę nad tym pracować.
__label__pl	Muszę jeszcze nad tym popracować.
__label__pl	Najpierw popracujemy nad tym.
__label__pl	Powinienem był o tym pomyśleć wcześniej.
__label__pl	Wierzę, że wiedza to potęga.
__label__pl	Spróbuj tego!
__label__pl	Oni wiedzą o tym.
__label__pl	Uważaj gdzie stawiasz nogi.
__label__pl	Nadepnąłem na ogon psa Toma.
__label__pl	Pochylił się, żeby zawiązać but.
__label__pl	Czy Tom przyszedł do domu?
__label__pl	Nasz przyszedł.
__label__pl	Nasza przyszła.
__label__pl	Teraz wpełzamy do łóżka.
__label__pl	Tom wczołgał się pod drut kolczasty.
__label__pl	Mogę zaczekać.
__label__pl	Nie mogłam spać.
__label__pl	Lepiej bym tego nie powiedział.
__label__pl	Nie mógłbym tego lepiej powiedzieć.
__label__pl	Czy Tom kiedykolwiek się uśmiecha?
__label__pl	Dlaczego Tom się nie uśmiecha?
__label__pl	Wszyscy na zdjęciu uśmiechają się radośnie.
__label__pl	Tom nie uśmiecha się często.
__label__pl	Niemowlę uśmiechnęło się do mnie.
__label__pl	Szczęście uśmiechnęło się do niego.
__label__pl	Szczęście uśmiechnęło się do niej.
__label__pl	Dziewczyna uśmiechnęła się do mnie.
__label__pl	Wszyscy trzej mężczyźni uśmiechnęli się.
__label__pl	Uśmiechnęli się do siebie.
__label__pl	Uśmiechnęły się do siebie.
__label__pl	Uśmiechnąłem się do siebie.
__label__pl	Uśmiechnęłam się do siebie.
__label__pl	Nie jem ogórków bez obierania.
__label__pl	Uczę się koreańskiego samodzielnie.
__label__pl	To byłaby ogromna strata czasu.
__label__pl	Gdzie jest teraz ta dziewczyna?
__label__pl	Priorytety Toma uległy zmianie.
__label__pl	Tom próbował mnie bronić.
__label__pl	Na zajęciach mówi tylko po fińsku.
__label__pl	Tom odnosi sukcesy, prawda?
__label__pl	Moje stopy są spuchnięte.
__label__pl	Mam spuchnięte stopy.
__label__pl	Optymiści żyją dłużej.
__label__pl	Dan wciąż żył.
__label__pl	Żył prostym życiem.
__label__pl	Żył skromnym życiem.
__label__pl	Para żyła szczęśliwym życiem.
__label__pl	Cierpią?
__label__pl	Cierpi na agorafobię.
__label__pl	Cierpi na anoreksję.
__label__pl	Czy cierpieli?
__label__pl	Czy nie wycierpiałem wystarczająco?
__label__pl	Gdzie leży Mississippi?
__label__pl	Dlaczego kłamiecie?
__label__pl	Ona nigdy nie kłamie.
__label__pl	Okłamujesz mnie?
__label__pl	Kłamała.
__label__pl	Okłamałem was.
__label__pl	Okłamałam was.
__label__pl	Kłamałem o tym.
__label__pl	Kłamałam o tym.
__label__pl	Tom znowu mnie okłamał.
__label__pl	Brzmiało łatwo.
__label__pl	Teraz idę się położyć.
__label__pl	Tom się rozłączył.
__label__pl	Ktoś położył kopertę na twoim biurku.
__label__pl	Musisz do domu.
__label__pl	Cieszy cię to?
__label__pl	Rozkoszowałam się piękną wiosną.
__label__pl	Kicham cały czas.
__label__pl	Była przeziębiona i wciąż kichała.
__label__pl	Boli mnie gardło i cieknie mi nos.
__label__pl	Dożo o tym myślę
__label__pl	Tom i Mery powiedzieli mi, że John był tym który im to powiedzieł
__label__pl	Oni zapomnieli zapłacić swój rachunek za telefon
__label__pl	Nie uważasz, że to torochę niemądre
__label__pl	Nie ma tego złego,co by na gorsze nie wyszło
__label__pl	za cholerę nie mogę pojąć
__label__pl	Grzegorz Brzęczyszczykiewicz, Chrząszczyżewoszyce, powiat Łękołody.
__label__pl	Zabierzesz mnie tam?
__label__pl	Jak się tam dostanę?
__label__pl	Jak często tam chodzisz?
__label__pl	Długo już czekacie?
__label__pl	Ona czeka na moją odpowiedź.
__label__pl	On czeka na moją odpowiedź.
__label__pl	Ona czeka na odpowiedź.
__label__pl	On czeka na odpowiedź.
__label__pl	Jesteście tacy leniwi!
__label__pl	Czy oboje jesteście szaleni?
__label__pl	Oboje jesteście szaleni.
__label__pl	Jesteście zupełnie bezużyteczni.
__label__pl	Przyjdziesz mnie odwiedzić?
__label__pl	Martwiliśmy się.
__label__pl	Martwimy się.
__label__pl	Martwiłem się o Toma.
__label__pl	Martwisz się o Toma?
__label__pl	Tom zrobił wyjątek.
__label__pl	Jesteś w ogóle głodny?
__label__pl	Jesteś w ogóle głodna?
__label__pl	Mówisz w ogóle po angielsku?
__label__pl	Ledwo mogę stać.
__label__pl	Tom ledwo mógł chodzić.
__label__pl	Ledwo mogę oddychać.
__label__pl	Tom ledwo oddycha.
__label__pl	Jestem okropny.
__label__pl	Jestem okropnie zmęczony.
__label__pl	Jestem okropnie zmęczona.
__label__pl	Obiecuję!
__label__pl	Obiecujesz?
__label__pl	Obiecujecie?
__label__pl	Obiecałem.
__label__pl	Obiecałeś, Jamal.
__label__pl	Tom obiecał pomóc.
__label__pl	Damy sobie radę.
__label__pl	Dał radę.
__label__pl	Dałaś radę!
__label__pl	Dałeś radę!
__label__pl	To było zrozumiałe.
__label__pl	Opowiedział o swoich przeżyciach.
__label__pl	Pamiętam ten wieczór.
__label__pl	Możemy wejść?
__label__pl	Nie musisz przychodzić do biura w sobotę.
__label__pl	Marzeniem Toma było płynne mówienie po francusku.
__label__pl	Myślę, że Tom się myli.
__label__pl	Dwoje dzieci przygotowało się na nudę.
__label__pl	Wydaje mi się, że on zna sekret.
__label__pl	Widzimy się na imprezie.
__label__pl	Badania ujawniły, że tak samo wysokie wskaźniki nieobecności w szkole występują we wszystkich ubogich dzielnicach.
__label__pl	Tom jest dość leniwy, co nie?
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że planuje u nas zostać przez kilka tygodni.
__label__pl	Pomysł się powiódł.
__label__pl	Toma cieszyło bycie sławnym.
__label__pl	To jest biurko, którego używa Tom.
__label__pl	Lepiej byś jej niedługo powiedział.
__label__pl	Jak wielu kozłów ofiarnych potrzebujemy, aby przywrócić deszcz?
__label__pl	Piraci chcieli sprowadzić go na złą drogę z powodu jego urody.
__label__pl	Jestem pewny, że nie muszę tego robić.
__label__pl	W rzeczywistości było dość nudno.
__label__pl	Dobrze tańczymy.
__label__pl	Nie wiedziałeś, że Tom nigdy tego nie zrobił, prawda?
__label__pl	Toma chyba w poniedziałki nie ma w domu.
__label__pl	On uczy.
__label__pl	Zrobię, co mogę, żeby ci to ułatwić.
__label__pl	Jeszcze wiele mamy do zrobienia.
__label__pl	Właśnie miałam cię zapytać o to samo.
__label__pl	Wygrana to nie wszystko.
__label__pl	Gdzie mój lunch?
__label__pl	Gdzie mój obiad?
__label__pl	Istniało zagrożenie wojną domową.
__label__pl	Ona ma duży talent.
__label__pl	Tu masz wiadomość.
__label__pl	Wychowałem się w bardzo typowej muzułmańskiej rodzinie.
__label__pl	Jeśli wszyscy jesteśmy winni, to wszyscy są bez winy.
__label__pl	Pies nie śpi.
__label__pl	Tom by to zrobił.
__label__pl	Co by się stało?
__label__pl	Tom by się zgodził.
__label__pl	Chętnie bym poszedł.
__label__pl	To by nie zaszkodziło.
__label__pl	Kasowanie czyichś komentarzy po tym jak zostały przeczytane nie jest wzięciem odpowiedzialności za swoje własne słowa.
__label__pl	To jest pierwszy raz, kiedy podrapałem swojego właściciela – powiedział kot.
__label__pl	Rozerwałem kopertę.
__label__pl	Rozerwałam kopertę.
__label__pl	Nic nie widzę!

__label__pl	Śpiewaj z nami.
__label__pl	Śpiewam teraz.
__label__pl	Próbuje śpiewać.

__label__pl	Tom śpiewał dla Mary.
__label__pl	John grał na gitarze a jego przyjaciele śpiewali.
__label__pl	Uśmiechała się do mnie śpiewając piosenkę.
__label__pl	Zaśpiewawszy, ptak odleciał.
__label__pl	Titanic zatonął w 1912.
__label__pl	Atlantyda zatonęła w morzu.
__label__pl	To był 1912, kiedy Titanic zatonął podczas swojego pierwszego rejsu.

__label__pl	Słońce świeci dla wszystkich.
__label__pl	Tutaj także świeci słońce.
__label__pl	Słońce świeci z błękitnego nieba.
__label__pl	Moje zdanie różni się od twojego.

__label__pl	Byłabym kochana.
__label__pl	Jak mógłbyś wiedzieć?
__label__pl	Jak mogłabyś wiedzieć?
__label__pl	Co by to znaczyło?
__label__pl	Mój brzuch krzyczy z głodu.
__label__pl	Nikt nie krzyczał.

__label__pl	Tom krzyczał na Mary.
__label__pl	Piszą.
__label__pl	Piszę dziennik.

__label__pl	Podpisałaś to?
__label__pl	Napisałem do Toma.

__label__pl	Napisała nowelę.
__label__pl	Powieści, które napisał, są interesujące.
__label__pl	Tom napisał książkę.
__label__pl	Napisałem wiele opowiadań.
__label__pl	Czemu kroisz te owoce?
__label__pl	Ten nóż nie kroi dobrze.
__label__pl	Zaciąłem się w palec.
__label__pl	Tom się skaleczył.
__label__pl	Tom przeciął gardło Mary.
__label__pl	Tom harował w pracy jak niewolnik.
__label__pl	Serce bije.
__label__pl	Uderzyła go.
__label__pl	Ktoś pobił Toma?
__label__pl	Pobił rekord.
__label__pl	Tom musiał uderzyć się w głowę.
__label__pl	Mary bardzo dyskretnie wytarła nos.
__label__pl	Tom ciągle śpi.
__label__pl	Czy ty kiedykolwiek śpisz?
__label__pl	Czemu śpisz?
__label__pl	Czemu śpicie?
__label__pl	Dzieci już śpią?

__label__pl	Już nie dam rady! Nie spałem od trzech dni!
__label__pl	Już nie dam rady! Nie spałam od trzech dni!
__label__pl	Konie biegają.
__label__pl	Tom szybko biega
__label__pl	On biega najszybciej.
__label__pl	Zając biega po ogrodzie.
__label__pl	Grupa biega po plaży.
__label__pl	Dziewczynki bawią się i biegają.
__label__pl	Naprawdę biegł.
__label__pl	Nikt nie biegł przed nim.
__label__pl	Tom biegł za Mary.
__label__pl	Pies mi uciekł.
__label__pl	Mój pies uciekł.
__label__pl	"Widzę", powiedział ślepy.
__label__pl	Skoczę.
__label__pl	Wejdę do środka.
__label__pl	Zejdę na dół.
__label__pl	Poradzę sobie z tym.
__label__pl	Co spowodowało Pani zaniepokojenie?

__label__pl	Przysięgam, że nigdy więcej tego nie zrobię.
__label__pl	Przeklinała głośno.

__label__pl	Zawsze to mówisz.
__label__pl	To mówi samo za siebie.
__label__pl	Rób co Tom mówi.
__label__pl	Tom nie mówi czemu.
__label__pl	Jak się to mówi?
__label__pl	Tylko mówię!
__label__pl	Cały czas to mówię.
__label__pl	Tom to powiedział?
__label__pl	Czy tom powiedział dlaczego?
__label__pl	Powiedzieli dlaczego?
__label__pl	Co Tom powiedział?
__label__pl	Nic nie powiedziałem.
__label__pl	Ktoś coś powiedział?

__label__pl	To mnie nie interesuje.
__label__pl	Ona ma duży nos.
__label__pl	Lwy mają daltonizm.

__label__pl	Czemu on chce wiedzieć, o czym myślimy?
__label__pl	Spożywam.
__label__pl	Robiłam zdjęcia.

__label__pl	Francuskie zamki są przepiękne.
__label__pl	Księgarnia jest otwarta.

__label__pl	On spędził kilka miesięcy w Szkocji.
__label__pl	Czekaliśmy trzy godziny.

__label__pl	Wybierz poprawną odpowiedź.
__label__pl	Tom ma blizny na rękach.
__label__pl	Chyba nie mam wyboru.
__label__pl	Zakładam, że ci za to płacą.
__label__pl	Tom lekko szturchnął Mary w żebra.
__label__pl	Byłaś tutaj tydzień temu?
__label__pl	Byłeś tutaj tydzień temu?
__label__pl	To dlatego go nienawidzę.
__label__pl	Ona jest jedynaczką, co nie?
__label__pl	Tom poszedł do sklepu kupić lody.
__label__pl	"Czy życie może istnieć bez grzechu?" zapytał stary filozof.

__label__pl	Nikt tego nie wiedział.
__label__pl	Niczego nie wiedziałem.
__label__pl	Tego nie wiedziałem.
__label__pl	Nie wiedziałaś tego?
__label__pl	Wiedziałem to już.
__label__pl	Wiedziałam to już.
__label__pl	Wiedziałeś to wtedy?
__label__pl	Wiedziałaś to wtedy?
__label__pl	Jeśli bym tylko wiedział!
__label__pl	Jeśli bym tylko wiedziała!
__label__pl	Wiedziałem, co masz na myśli.
__label__pl	Wiedziałam, co masz na myśli.
__label__pl	Nawet profesor nie znał odpowiedzi.
__label__pl	Wydaje się, że o tym nie wiedział.
__label__pl	Szkoda, że nie wiedziałem.
__label__pl	Szkoda, że nie wiedziałam.
__label__pl	Tom złożył mapę i schował z powrotem do schowka.
__label__pl	Próbuję schudnąć.
__label__pl	Schudłaś?
__label__pl	Chcę marzyć.
__label__pl	Tom chce grać.
__label__pl	Chcemy głosować.
__label__pl	Chciałem tam iść.
__label__pl	Chciałam tam iść.
__label__pl	Chciałem tam.
__label__pl	Chciałam tam.
__label__pl	Tom pragnął zemsty.
__label__pl	Czego chcieli?
__label__pl	Chciałam się opalać.
__label__pl	Chciałem się opalać.
__label__pl	Zawsze chciałem mieć psa.
__label__pl	Zawsze chciałam mieć kota.
__label__pl	Pochlebstwem nie zdobywa się niczego.
__label__pl	Mam nadzieję, że wygram.
__label__pl	Wygrałaś?
__label__pl	Wygrałeś?
__label__pl	Wygrałyście?
__label__pl	Faktycznie wygrali.
__label__pl	Faktycznie wygrały.
__label__pl	Wygrał wszystko.
__label__pl	Tom znowu wygrał?
__label__pl	Co wygrałem?
__label__pl	Co wygrałam?
__label__pl	Wygrała telefon.
__label__pl	Nie wybieram.
__label__pl	Który wybierasz?
__label__pl	„Wybieram ciebie.” „Dlaczego mnie?”
__label__pl	Który wybrałeś?
__label__pl	Który wybrałaś?
__label__pl	Wybrałeś temat?
__label__pl	Wybrałaś temat?
__label__pl	Przyzwyczaję się.
__label__pl	Przyzwyczaisz się.
__label__pl	Szybko przyzwyczaisz się do swojej nowej szkoły.
__label__pl	Szybko przyzwyczaił się do zimnej pogody.
__label__pl	My mężczyźni przywykliśmy czekać na kobiety.
__label__pl	Populacja Szwecji rośnie.
__label__pl	Chińska gospodarka rośnie szybko.
__label__pl	Te kwiaty rosną w ciepłych krajach.
__label__pl	Gdzie dorastałeś?
__label__pl	Gdzie dorastałaś?
__label__pl	Gdzie dorastaliście?
__label__pl	Gdzie dorastałyście?
__label__pl	Dorastałem na wsi.
__label__pl	To dziecko dorosło normalnie.
__label__pl	Wyrosłeś.
__label__pl	Wyrosłaś.
__label__pl	Wyrośliście.
__label__pl	Wyrosłyście.
__label__pl	Dorośliście.
__label__pl	Dorosłyście.
__label__pl	Boston rozrósł się szybko w ciągu ostatnich dziesięciu lat.
__label__pl	Jemy lunch.
__label__pl	Kto je pszczoły?
__label__pl	Kobieta je chleb.
__label__pl	Tom je powoli.
__label__pl	Czy Tom je winogrona?
__label__pl	Co jedzą mewy?
__label__pl	Jedzą czekoladę.
__label__pl	Jedli.
__label__pl	Jadły.
__label__pl	Jadłam kawiar.
__label__pl	Tom coś jadł.
__label__pl	Jadłaś śniadanie?
__label__pl	Jadłeś coś?
__label__pl	Jadłaś coś?
__label__pl	Jadł jabłko.
__label__pl	Jadła jabłko.
__label__pl	Dobrze zjadłem.
__label__pl	Ból był nie do zniesienia.
__label__pl	Miałem straszne boleści.
__label__pl	Nic cię już nie boli?
__label__pl	Upał jest nie do zniesienia.
__label__pl	Zepchnął samochód w dół.
__label__pl	Nie wyrzucaj niczego!
__label__pl	Nie wyrzucajcie niczego!
__label__pl	Dlatego odchodzisz?
__label__pl	Znam drogę.
__label__pl	Nie idź za daleko!
__label__pl	Jak długo cię nie będzie?
__label__pl	Który kot jest twój?
__label__pl	Czego chce ten kot?
__label__pl	Szukam mojego kota.
__label__pl	Tom nie chciał, żeby Mary jadła tak dużo słodyczy.
__label__pl	Tom właśnie skończył sprzątać swój pokój.
__label__pl	Przestraszyłem was?
__label__pl	Przestraszyłam was?
__label__pl	Proszę nie mów o tym nikomu.
__label__pl	Zadzwoniłem.
__label__pl	Tom dostał podwyżkę.
__label__pl	Zrzuciłem szklankę ze stołu.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary powiedzieli, że podleją ogród.
__label__pl	Mary powiedziała mi, że myśli, że Tom jest egoistą.
__label__pl	Zazwyczaj nie byłoby to problemem.
__label__pl	Mówiłem ci, żeby nie ufać Tomowi.
__label__pl	Lubisz hokeja, prawda?
__label__pl	Nie zgodził się nawet z nią porozmawiać.
__label__pl	Tom upierał się, że nie ma nic wspólnego z napadem.
__label__pl	Przewodniczący zaproponował, żebyśmy przedyskutowali problem.
__label__pl	Przewodniczący nie wykluczał możliwości nieporozumienia.
__label__pl	Przewodniczący odrzucił wniosek.
__label__pl	Ona uczestniczyła w spotkaniu na prośbę przewodniczącego.
__label__pl	Chciałbym mianować Dona Jonesa przewodniczącym.
__label__pl	Parlament został rozwiązany.
__label__pl	Projekt ustawy został przegłosowany przez przeważającą większość.
__label__pl	Przednie światła chwilowo nas wszystkich oślepiły.
__label__pl	Zadzwoniłam do Toma idąc na przystanek.
__label__pl	Mają coś do zrobienia.
__label__pl	Oni mają coś do zrobienia.
__label__pl	Nartnik pływa na wodzie.
__label__pl	Pieczony pstrąg to moja ulubiona ryba.
__label__pl	Niestety wystąpił błąd.
__label__pl	Kupię pianino.
__label__pl	Tom właśnie kupił nowy komputer.
__label__pl	Tom przed trzema laty mieszkał w Bostonie.
__label__pl	Chodź spróbować.
__label__pl	Poproszę kartę pokładową.
__label__pl	Aresztowali Toma.
__label__pl	Aresztowano Toma.
__label__pl	Przeczytałem artykuł, a teraz piszę streszczenie.
__label__pl	Przeczytałam artykuł, a teraz piszę streszczenie.
__label__pl	Zazwyczaj nie jem deseru.
__label__pl	Tom dokładnie wie, co trzeba zrobić.
__label__pl	Ryzyko śmierci Layli rosło z każdą godziną.
__label__pl	Wszędzie byli strażacy.
__label__pl	Nie fatyguj się.
__label__pl	Zwinęliśmy dywan.
__label__pl	Czemu ze mną nie zatańczysz?
__label__pl	Organizmy mają określoną długość życia.
__label__pl	Nienawidzę organizacji terrorystycznych.
__label__pl	Ludzie są skomplikowanymi organizmami.
__label__pl	Kocham tę organizację.
__label__pl	Jestem bardzo zorganizowany.
__label__pl	Gram na organach.
__label__pl	Umiesz grać na organach?
__label__pl	To duży narząd.
__label__pl	To jest jednokomórkowy organizm.
__label__pl	Posprzątałem na biurku.
__label__pl	Twoja praca jest słabo zorganizowana.
__label__pl	Nie wiedziałem, że ktoś wciąż mieszka w tamtym domu.
__label__pl	Nie mogę się tym z Tobą podzielić.
__label__pl	Mary nie mogła pójść pływać, ponieważ była chora.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary powiedzieli mi, że nie zamierzają tego zrobić ponownie.
__label__pl	Tom nie mógł zrobić nic, aby pomóc Mary.
__label__pl	On robi wszystko co mu rozkażą.
__label__pl	Oni zdarli swoje łokcie.
__label__pl	Jej wciąż podoba się ta kabylska suknia.
__label__pl	Tom prawdopodobnie nie wie czy Mary potrafi dobrze śpiewać, czy nie.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary powinni powiedzieć Johnowi, że tego nie zrobią.
__label__pl	Ona rozgłasza oszczerstwa o nim.
__label__pl	Mary powiedziała, że nie ma nic do zrobienia.
__label__pl	Tom obiecał to zrobić w tym tygodniu.
__label__pl	Yanni był w galerii.
__label__pl	Powiedziała, że była zadowolona.
__label__pl	Mary jest przytomna, co nie?
__label__pl	Tom i Mary powiedzieli Johnowi, że nie sądzili, że zdołają to powtórzyć.
__label__pl	Pies Yanni był z nim.
__label__pl	Tom jest na mnie wściekły.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary nie dotrzymali danego słowa.
__label__pl	Zdziwiłbym się, gdyby Tom zgodził się z Mary.
__label__pl	Powinieneś zaufać swojemu przeczuciu.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział Mary, że nie ona musi tego robić.
__label__pl	Ona zostawiła dla niego notatkę na stole.
__label__pl	Tom nie był nam zbyt pomocny.
__label__pl	Według mnie to smakuje mdło.
__label__pl	Spotkałem jednego z Jacksonów na imprezie.
__label__pl	Zamierzam zostać w Australii z moim wujkiem.
__label__pl	Powiedz proszę Tomowi i Mary, że nie muszą tego robić.
__label__pl	Dzieci nie posłuchały jednak swojej matki i, bawiąc się pewnego dnia w ogrodzie, zbłądziły tuż pod okna zamku.
__label__pl	Prawie nigdy nie sypiam bez poduszki.
__label__pl	Ona ma przed sobą całkiem niezłą karierę.
__label__pl	Nie ważne jak dobre jest twoje życie, zawsze znajdziesz powód, by być nieszczęśliwym.
__label__pl	Dowiedziałeś się gdzie żyją Tom i Mary?
__label__pl	Nigdy nie zapomnę jak bardzo byłeś dla mnie uprzejmy.
__label__pl	Nie sądziłem, że Tom wstanie tak wcześnie rano.
__label__pl	Nie myślałem, że Tom będzie tak wcześnie na nogach.
__label__pl	Mary opowiedziała wszystkim co zrobiła.
__label__pl	Może Tom i ja za dużo pracujemy.
__label__pl	Tom nie leciał tym samym samolotem co Mary.
__label__pl	Co za szczęśliwy przypadek.
__label__pl	Mary powiedziała, że nie chciałaby mieszkać w Bostonie.
__label__pl	Mary nie powiedziała kiedy będzie w domu.
__label__pl	Ona powiedziała, że dużo się od niego nauczyła.
__label__pl	Mówiłaś, że chciałaś, żebym to dla Ciebie kupił.
__label__pl	Ona mówi, że nie możemy z nim porozmawiać.
__label__pl	Jak wypoczywasz w wolnym czasie?
__label__pl	Tom prawdopodobnie nie zrobił tego sam.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary mają wiele do zrobienia zanim będą mogli pójść do domu.
__label__pl	W autobusie nie starczy miejsca dla wszystkich.
__label__pl	Nie chcę aby mój syn stał się jak Tom.
__label__pl	Powiedziałeś Tomowi dlaczego tego nie zrobiłeś?
__label__pl	On został dłużej niż musiał.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary robią wszystko, co w ich mocy.
__label__pl	Dobrym pomysłem byłoby byście zrobili to sami.
__label__pl	Napisała dla niego piosenkę.
__label__pl	Próbował się od niej uwolnić.
__label__pl	Planuję spędzić trzy miesiące w Bostonie.
__label__pl	Nigdy nie słyszałem, żeby opowiadał o swoim życiu w Kanadzie.
__label__pl	Tom nie wyglądał na tak wściekłego jak Mary.
__label__pl	Oglądaj filmy po francusku.
__label__pl	Tom jest jednym z przyjaciół mojej siostry.
__label__pl	Mary powiedziała wszystkim, że czuła się dobrze.
__label__pl	Nie pomyślałbym, że Tom bałby się tak małego pieska.
__label__pl	To nie jest kwestia tylko ceny.
__label__pl	On jest pewien, że ona potrafi o siebie zadbać.
__label__pl	Tom nie powiedział mi dlaczego był tak wściekły.
__label__pl	Nie mogę się doczekać, żeby usłyszeć opinię Toma.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary powiedzieli, że wiedzieli, że John tak postąpi.
__label__pl	Czy Tom powiedział gdzie się wybiera latem?
__label__pl	Tom nie da rady.
__label__pl	Tom nie sprosta.
__label__pl	Mój pokój jest czystszy niż twój.
__label__pl	Mary powiedziała, że nie chciałaby tego robić bez żadnej pomocy.
__label__pl	Mary nie zdała testu z francuskiego.
__label__pl	Wciąż się zastanawiam czemu Tom i Mary tego nie zrobili.
__label__pl	Wiele z kanadyjskich turystów odwiedza Australię.
__label__pl	Powiedziałeś Tomowi, że nie wiem jak to zrobić, co nie?
__label__pl	Zadzwonię do Toma następnym razem gdy będę w mieście.
__label__pl	On wątpi, że ona potrafi o siebie zadbać.
__label__pl	Pomimo, że Mary twierdziła, że da radę to zrobić, to nie podołała.
__label__pl	Powiedziałem Mary, że się nią zaopiekuję.
__label__pl	Matka Mary zawsze mówiła jej by jadła więcej warzyw.
__label__pl	To chciałem z Tobą przedyskutować.
__label__pl	O tym chciałem z Tobą porozmawiać.
__label__pl	Pewnie poszła na ryby sama.
__label__pl	Mary nie jest pewna czy jest gotowa czy nie.
__label__pl	Możesz, równie dobrze, zrobić to dzisiaj.
__label__pl	Tom nie był w najlepszym nastroju.
__label__pl	Mary nie sądziła, że Tom pozwoli jej prowadzić.
__label__pl	Uwielbiam humus!
__label__pl	Tom wydaje się być zawsze w pośpiechu.
__label__pl	Mam dość tego jak Tom się zachowuje.
__label__pl	Kto zamknął bramę?
__label__pl	Podoba ci się film?
__label__pl	Mennad kupił drogą kurtkę ze skóry.
__label__pl	Poproszę Toma by dla nas zaśpiewał.
__label__pl	Komputer Samiego kosztuje sześć tysięcy dolarów.
__label__pl	W czym jeszcze mogę ci pomóc?
__label__pl	Nie pracuję tyle godzin tygodniowo co kiedyś.
__label__pl	Mary nie powinna była zostać tu sama.
__label__pl	Wygląda na to, że Tom zna Mary.
__label__pl	Przeprowadziliśmy się do Bostonu trzy miesiące temu.
__label__pl	Powinieneś był zostać w domu skoro masz poważne przeziębienie.
__label__pl	Nie będziesz tego więcej potrzebować.
__label__pl	Jego hotel jest częścią sieci.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary żałują tego co zrobili.
__label__pl	To jest najcięższa rola jakiej kiedykolwiek się podjął.
__label__pl	Mary jest aromaterapeutką.
__label__pl	Mary nie była pewna jak mogłaby pomóc.
__label__pl	Nie musimy więcej pomagać Tomowi.
__label__pl	Mary powiedziała, że nie może się doczekać, żeby ponownie zobaczyć Toma.
__label__pl	Gdzie mogę dowiedzieć się więcej o tym co się dzieje?
__label__pl	Sami nie zamierza zerwać z Laylą.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary powiedzieli, że nie wiedzą dlaczego John nie chciał tego zrobić.
__label__pl	Mary zdjęła swoje buty.
__label__pl	Według tego raportu, to Tom i Mary spowodowali wypadek.
__label__pl	To nie jest główny powód, dla którego Tom i Mary nie chcą tego zrobić.
__label__pl	Tom nie był zaskoczony odpowiedzią.
__label__pl	Nie byłbym w stanie tego zrobić bez ciebie.
__label__pl	On zrobił to samemu.
__label__pl	Sami zaprowadził Laylę na górę.
__label__pl	Pozostałem spokojny i skoncentrowany.
__label__pl	Tom chciałby wiedzieć jak to zrobiłeś.
__label__pl	Mary zjadła ciastka, które zrobił dla niej Tom.
__label__pl	Jestem z Algier w Algierii.
__label__pl	Zrobienie tego nie powinno zająć nam zbyt długo.
__label__pl	Yanni zauważył mężczyznę zaglądającego przez okno.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary powiedzieli, że myśleli, że John już to zrobił.
__label__pl	Uważa się, że nowy koronawirus pochodzi od nietoperza, który zakaził łuskowca na targu dzikimi zwierzętami w Chinach.
__label__pl	Mary bawi się swoimi lalkami.
__label__pl	Sami jest inny.
__label__pl	Mary nie chciała mnie wpuścić do swojego pokoju.
__label__pl	Mary zaprzeczyła, że Tom ją namówił, by to zrobiła.
__label__pl	Tom i ja zrobimy to tak jak nam pokazałeś.
__label__pl	Tom nie wie czy Mary rozumie francuski.
__label__pl	Kto się Tobą zajmuje, gdy się źle czujesz?
__label__pl	Yanni usłyszał dziwne odgłosy.
__label__pl	Mary powiedziała mi, że nie lubi grać w szachy.
__label__pl	Oni wznieśli swoje ręce.
__label__pl	Wiem, że nie lubisz siatkówki.
__label__pl	Mary siedzi w kącie kompletnie sama.
__label__pl	Zobaczył jej imię w liście.
__label__pl	Wygląda na to, że Tom i Mary są zajęci.
__label__pl	Tom zdjął swoje buty.
__label__pl	Mary pomaga każdemu, kto ją poprosi.
__label__pl	Chcesz, żebym poprosił Toma, żeby kupił to dla ciebie?
__label__pl	Tom nie chce pożyczyć mi pieniędzy, których potrzebuję.
__label__pl	Mary kończy swoją zmianę o 2:30.
__label__pl	Odpowiedział z uśmiechem.
__label__pl	Nie muszę jechać do Bostonu przed przyszłym tygodniem.
__label__pl	Odłożył swój napój.
__label__pl	Zamierzam pójść na tę audycję.
__label__pl	Historia samiego jest taka dziwna.
__label__pl	Mary w końcu zrobiła to, co mówiła, że zrobi.
__label__pl	Jutro rano Tom i ja opuszczamy Australię.
__label__pl	Sami powiedział, że rasizm był bardzo powszechny w jego mieście.
__label__pl	Byłem tak samo zaskoczony jak Tom i Mary.
__label__pl	Ty i ja również jesteśmy zaproszeni.
__label__pl	Tom nie był w stanie zobzaczyć co się działo.
__label__pl	Tom wytarł zakrwawiony nóż o swoją koszulę.
__label__pl	Dan i Linda spędzają lato razem.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary mają nadzieję, że wygrają.
__label__pl	Tom ma trzynastoletnią siostrę.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że Mary jest bardzo zajęta.
__label__pl	Oni nie są zainteresowani oszczędzaniem pieniędzy.
__label__pl	Ona podała mu pustą butelkę.
__label__pl	Mary wygląda absolutnie zniewalająco.
__label__pl	To nie byłoby takie głupie.
__label__pl	Jakie są korzyści z randek?
__label__pl	Tom zmarł wieczorem w ostatni poniedziałek.
__label__pl	Uwielbiam patrzeć jak pracujesz.
__label__pl	Byłem chory w zeszłym tygodniu.
__label__pl	Jeśli ktoś wie, proszę, dajcie mi wskazówkę.
__label__pl	Jest ich około dwudziestu.
__label__pl	Mój ojciec ma ranczo i hoduje bydło i konie.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary powiedzieli, że są bardzo wściekli.
__label__pl	Naprawdę nie mogę się tego doczekać.
__label__pl	Król Francji jest łysy.
__label__pl	Starczy miejsca dla wszystkich.
__label__pl	Byłeś kiedykolwiek w Bostonie?
__label__pl	Tom poprosił Mary do tańca, pomimo, że mówił, że tego nie zrobi.
__label__pl	Chciałbym zobaczyć jak Tom i Mary to robią.
__label__pl	On nienawidził mnie wcześniej.
__label__pl	Myślę, że Tom powinien być bardziej cierpliwy.
__label__pl	Ja również nie potrafię pływać.
__label__pl	Cieszę się, że ją lubisz.
__label__pl	Tom pije piwo.
__label__pl	Chciałbym odwołać swoją jutrzejszą wizytę.
__label__pl	Sami chciał zobaczyć Laylę na plaży.
__label__pl	Powiedziano mi, że nie będzie mi wolno tego zrobić.
__label__pl	Restauracja Samiego zostanie otwarta.
__label__pl	Wciąż jestem tą samą osobą, którą byłem wcześniej.
__label__pl	To jest wielka ulga.
__label__pl	Jestem bardzo uczciwy, zawsze mówię prawdę.
__label__pl	Zastanawia mnie czemu Tom i Mary nie chcą tego zrobić.
__label__pl	Myślę, że Tom i Mary zakochali się w sobie.
__label__pl	Nie pozwól mu cię przestraszyć.
__label__pl	Musisz o siebie dbać.
__label__pl	Pokojówka sprzątała pokój odkurzaczem.
__label__pl	To jest ich praca.
__label__pl	Musiałem zgubić kluczyki od samochodu.
__label__pl	Powiedział mi, że jest bardzo głodny.
__label__pl	To jest nasza praca, żeby to zrobić.
__label__pl	Gdzie jest dowód, że Tom kiedykolwiek to zrobił?
__label__pl	Powiedz Tomowi, żeby przyniósł sałatkę.
__label__pl	Tom nie powinien był się wtrąca w to co robiła Mary.
__label__pl	Powiem ci co Tom i ja zamierzamy zrobić.
__label__pl	Dziś jestem tak szczęśliwy, że mógłbym zwariować. Chciałbym móc przytulić cały świat!
__label__pl	Pomimo, że był dzieckiem, zdecydował się zrobić pracę samemu.
__label__pl	Co gdyby Statua Wolności była zrobiona ze złota?
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że nie planuje iść z nami w ten weekend.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że nie wybiera się z nami w ten weekend.
__label__pl	Zadzwonię do ciebie jak tylko wrócę do domu.
__label__pl	Staram się to ignorować.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary biegli między drzewami, gdy Mary nagle wystawiła swoją stopę, Tom przewrócił się i wpadł wprost do kałuży.
__label__pl	Dzieci są często bardzo dobre w nauce języków obcych.
__label__pl	Mary obiecała mi, że tego nie zrobi.
__label__pl	Mary nie jest tak cierpliwa jak była kiedyś.
__label__pl	Ktoś czeka w twoim gabinecie.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że troje z tamtych chłopców są jego synami.
__label__pl	Imię Toma było trzecie na liście.
__label__pl	Tom miał kolejny atak serca.
__label__pl	Przeczytałem ostatnio świetną książkę o historii średniowiecznej Europy.
__label__pl	Podczas spaceru nadepnąłem na gwoźdź i musiałem udać się do szpitala.
__label__pl	Tom gra na gitarze.
__label__pl	Czy Tom się bał?
__label__pl	Baliśmy się.
__label__pl	Miałem atak astmy.
__label__pl	Tom miał wypadek drogowy.
__label__pl	Tom miał guza mózgu.
__label__pl	Aplikacja nie zadziała, jeśli nie jesteś połączony z Internetem.
__label__pl	Komputer Toma ma już trzy lata.
__label__pl	Mary nie zasługiwała na twoje zaufanie.
__label__pl	Czy naprawdę sądzisz, że bezpiecznie jest pić tę wodę.
__label__pl	Czy naprawdę myślisz, że ta woda jest zdatna do picia?
__label__pl	„Zdecydowałam, że chcę opowiedzieć moją historię, opowiedzieć ją w taki sposób w jaki chciałam, by była opowiedziana,” powiedziała.
__label__pl	Chciałabym kiedyś odwiedzić tamto miejsce.
__label__pl	Mary poprosiła, żeby jej nie przeszkadzać.
__label__pl	Nie zostaniesz na chwilę?
__label__pl	Szanuj siebie, a będziesz szanowana.
__label__pl	Potrzebujesz Toma w tym momencie?
__label__pl	Obiecuję, że nikomu nie powiem kim jesteś.
__label__pl	Tom ma wystarczająco czasu, żeby to zrobić.
__label__pl	Jak zagłosowałaś w tamtej sprawie?
__label__pl	Ojciec Toma opuścił swoją rodzinę.
__label__pl	Tom wygląda, jakby miał ból głowy.
__label__pl	Szczerze mówiąc, to widziałem już ten film.
__label__pl	Yanni uczęszcza do innego kościoła niż jego rodzina.
__label__pl	Pomóż mi zapiąć moją suknię.
__label__pl	Myślę, że to jest dobre.
__label__pl	Przy odrobinie szczęścia pogoda będzie dobra.
__label__pl	Nie wiem, brachu. Nigdy nad tym nie myślałem.
__label__pl	Poszedłeś nie żegnając się ze mną.
__label__pl	Nie mów jej tego, proszę!
__label__pl	Ona usłyszała jak mówił do siebie.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że teraz można już jeść.
__label__pl	Dopilnuj, żeby Tomowi nic się nie stało.
__label__pl	Pytałeś Mary czemu nie była na spotkaniu?
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że to nie był prawdziwy powód, dla którego Mary tak postąpiła.
__label__pl	Czy możesz mi pomóc tego szukać?
__label__pl	Nie zostawiaj mnie z nimi samego.
__label__pl	Iran jest osiemnastym największym państwem na świecie.
__label__pl	Czy on ci powiedział?
__label__pl	Wróciłem do domu i powiedziałem żonie o pracy w Australii, którą mi zaoferowano.
__label__pl	Został kierowcą taksówki.
__label__pl	Mary może zostać zaaresztowana, jeśli to zrobi.
__label__pl	Tom już opuścił Boston.
__label__pl	Nasza populacja rozrasta się wykładniczo.
__label__pl	Tom by mi nie uwierzył.
__label__pl	Ręce Toma są za jego plecami.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary nie chcą nosić jeansów.
__label__pl	Tom myślał, że Mary pojawi się na dzisiejszym spotkaniu.
__label__pl	Tom sądził, że Mary będzie obecna na dzisiejszym spotkaniu.
__label__pl	Wszyscy wiemy, że Tom i Mary są winni.
__label__pl	Czy ktokolwiek kiedykolwiek powiedział ci prawdę?
__label__pl	Mary zapytała Toma czy znał jej nowy adres.
__label__pl	Wymyj swoje ręce wodą i mydłem.
__label__pl	Jestem pewien, że Tom nie miałby nic przeciwko pomaganiu ci przez kilka godzin.
__label__pl	Czułam się taka odizolowana.
__label__pl	Czy Tom chce iść?
__label__pl	Tom na pewno nie jest już w Australii.
__label__pl	Często masz rybę na obiad?
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że Mary prawdopodobnie wciąż była samotna.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział Mary, że John był nieprzytomny.
__label__pl	Oni zawsze są dla mnie bardzo nieuczciwi.
__label__pl	To nie jest jeszcze suche.
__label__pl	Część z tamtych rzeczy może być moja.
__label__pl	Nie lubiłam uczyć się francuskiego.
__label__pl	Czy naprawdę chcesz, by zrobił to kto inny?
__label__pl	Możesz nam o tym opowiedzieć?
__label__pl	Przyznała się, że to zrobiła.
__label__pl	Co Mary i Tom o tym sądzą?
__label__pl	Ona lubi swoje lekcje.
__label__pl	Hydroterapia jest wykorzystaniem wody do łagodzenia bólu i leczenia przypadłości.
__label__pl	Zrobiłyśmy to razem.
__label__pl	To pierwsza rzecz, którą robię rankiem.
__label__pl	Powiedział mi, że nie czuł się urażony.
__label__pl	Może to powinno się zmienić.
__label__pl	Nie jest mądrym zawsze robić to co inni ci każą.
__label__pl	Dlaczego to mi się przytrafia?
__label__pl	Ktoś będzie musiał w końcu powiedzieć Tomowi.
__label__pl	Rozmawiam z Tobą, jak bym rozmawiał z przyjacielem.
__label__pl	Zapłaciłbym za coś takiego.
__label__pl	Muiriel obiecała mi, że jeśli przeczytam książkę „The Picture of Dorian Gray” w całości po angielsku, to pomoże mi z moim zadaniem z matematyki.
__label__pl	Chcę, żebyś z nimi porozmawiał.
__label__pl	Ta roślina jest jadalna.
__label__pl	Dan usłyszał jak Matt i Linda się sprzeczali.
__label__pl	Czy mogę jej powiedzieć?
__label__pl	Mary jest całkiem interesującą kobietą.
__label__pl	Zjedliśmy wczorajszej nocy stanowczo zbyt dużo.
__label__pl	Kiedyś to kochałeś.
__label__pl	Musimy porozmawiać o tym jak to zrobić.
__label__pl	To wszystko moja wina.
__label__pl	Mary powiedziała, że się spóźni.
__label__pl	Mam nadzieję, że cię nie nudzę.
__label__pl	Nie widzę sensu kontynuowania tej konwersacji.
__label__pl	Pomyliłem Toma z jego bratem.
__label__pl	Poznałem Toma wiele dekad temu.
__label__pl	Nigdy nie zagłosowałbym na tego człowieka.
__label__pl	To była kiedyś bardzo cicha okolica.
__label__pl	To jest bardzo proste pytanie.
__label__pl	Wiedziałam, że przyjdziesz.
__label__pl	Przeznaczenia nie oszukasz.
__label__pl	Zastanawia mnie, czemu Tom się spóźnia.
__label__pl	Samiemu się to nie spodobało.
__label__pl	Tom nie mógł zajść daleko.
__label__pl	Wcześniejsze doświadczenie nie jest wymagane.
__label__pl	Nie powinniśmy jej pomóc?
__label__pl	On pojechał do Bostonu, żeby ją zobaczyć.
__label__pl	Każdy marzy o szczęściu.
__label__pl	Możesz dla mnie przyszyć ten guzik?
__label__pl	Jestem pewna, że Tom będzie się bał.
__label__pl	Nie wolno ci tu palić.
__label__pl	Oni są bardzo niebezpieczni.
__label__pl	Nie powinnaś odwiedzać dziś mojego dziadka.
__label__pl	Może ktoś mógłby mnie oświecić.
__label__pl	Nie pluj na ściany.
__label__pl	To kosztuje wiele pieniędzy.
__label__pl	Nie bądź zaskoczona.
__label__pl	Proszę nie pisać w tej książce bibliotecznej.
__label__pl	Pozwól mi z nią spędzić choć pięć minut więcej.
__label__pl	Oni robią wszystko co im powiem.
__label__pl	Tom poprosił Mary, żeby do niego zadzwoniła, jak tylko dotrze do Bostonu.
__label__pl	Chciałbym pomóc jeśli mogę.
__label__pl	Ona podała mu album ze zdjęciami.
__label__pl	Jaka z niej piękna kobieta!
__label__pl	Tom pierwszy dotarł do linii mety.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że nie zrobił tego, co powinien był zrobić.
__label__pl	Ani Tom ani Mary nie zostali ukarani.
__label__pl	Widziałam, jak Tom wysiadał z autobusu.
__label__pl	Zostań, proszę, jak długo chcesz.
__label__pl	Tu jest mój różowy notatnik.
__label__pl	Każdy jest zamknięty w domu w samoizolacji.
__label__pl	Moje siły mnie całkiem opuściły.
__label__pl	Wydaje mi się, że zostawiłem swój telefon w twoim domu.
__label__pl	Ledwie wiążę koniec z końcem.
__label__pl	Mógłbyś pożyczyć mi trochę pieniędzy do dnia wypłaty?
__label__pl	W autobusie było bardzo tłoczno.
__label__pl	Ona potrzebuje interpretatora.
__label__pl	Oni zjedli pizzę z serem kozim.
__label__pl	Dlaczego mówisz tak głośno?
__label__pl	Nikt nie rozmawiał o filmie.
__label__pl	Tom nie pożyczy ci swojej parasolki.
__label__pl	Nie daj się zmylić jego wyglądowi.
__label__pl	„Ale co, jeśli ona powie nie?” „To powie nie.”
__label__pl	„Ale co, jeżeli ona się nie zgodzi?” „To się nie zgodzi.”
__label__pl	Wiem, że Tom będzie następnym, który to zrobi.
__label__pl	Czego szukamy?
__label__pl	Motocykle są fajne. Możesz przemieszczać się bezproblemowo nawet w korku.
__label__pl	Myślałem, że byłeś nauczycielem francuskiego.
__label__pl	Dzień dobry, kiedy odjeżdża następny pociąg do Paryża? Dziękuję.
__label__pl	Wiemy, że to był nasz obowiązek.
__label__pl	Mam trzy francuskie książki.
__label__pl	On zapomniał swojego hasła.
__label__pl	Przestań palić koło dzieci.
__label__pl	Ona jest naprawdę miłą osobą.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary nie zrzucili tak dużo wagi jak mówią.
__label__pl	Tom napełnił formę.
__label__pl	Oni dalej się ze sobą porozumiewają.
__label__pl	Wiedziałam, że Tom może musieć zrobić to samemu.
__label__pl	Czy to Tom był tym, kto poprosił Mary, żeby to zrobiła?
__label__pl	Tom mówi, że musi się pojutrze udać do Australii.
__label__pl	Tom prosi nas, żeby mu pomóc.
__label__pl	Chciałbym was wszystkich przeprosić za to, co się przed chwilą stało.
__label__pl	Zastanawia mnie, czemu Tom kłamie.
__label__pl	Szykuj się! Jutro jest ostatni dzień.
__label__pl	Co wolisz bardziej: herbatę, czy kawę?
__label__pl	Nie wydaje mi się, żebym miał wystarczająco pieniędzy, żeby kupić wszystko, czego chcę.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że jesteście starymi przyjaciółmi.
__label__pl	Czy Tom i Mary naprawdę się zabili?
__label__pl	Tom nie powiedział nikomu co zamierzał zrobić.
__label__pl	Ona zbiegła po schodach.
__label__pl	Wiem, że to co zrobiłeś nie było intencjonalne.
__label__pl	Jeśli nie jesteś poranną osobą, to ucz się po południu.
__label__pl	Musimy działać wspólnie, żeby uczynić Tatoeba lepszą stroną.
__label__pl	Musimy współpracować w celu zrobienia z Tatoeba lepszej strony.
__label__pl	Śledztwo utknęło w martwym punkcie.
__label__pl	Czy widzisz to światło?
__label__pl	Wiem, że Tom jest twoim przyjacielem, ale, mimo to, go nie lubię.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że nie sądził, że Mary chciała zrobić to sama.
__label__pl	Przed wypadkiem Tom liczył na to, żeby zostać profesjonalnym tenisistą.
__label__pl	Nikt z nas nie był w stanie odpowiedzieć na pytanie.
__label__pl	Powiedziałem Tomowi, czemu Mary udała się do Bostonu.
__label__pl	Mary powiedziała, że powinna była wyjść wcześniej.
__label__pl	Czekałem, aż powiesz mi co mam zrobić.
__label__pl	Nie był uprzejmy.
__label__pl	Czy miałeś okazję to spróbować?
__label__pl	Nie widziałem jeszcze filmu o którym rozmawiacie.
__label__pl	Tom jest najlepszym gitarzystą jakiego kiedykolwiek słyszałem osobiście.
__label__pl	Tom nigdy nie korzysta z pociągów.
__label__pl	Tom nigdy nie jeździ pociągami.
__label__pl	Zakładam że byłeś w Bostonie.
__label__pl	Zrobiłaś to z własnej, nieprzymuszonej woli?
__label__pl	Spodziewałem się zobaczyć Toma na imprezie, ale go tam nie było.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy trojgiem braci.
__label__pl	Mojemu mężowi jego ubrania są obojętne.
__label__pl	Czy serwer znów upadł?
__label__pl	Nie sądzę że wszyscy się poddali.
__label__pl	Powodzenia ze wszystkim.
__label__pl	Zawsze mu ufałem.
__label__pl	Zawsze mu ufałam.
__label__pl	Zawsze jej ufałem.
__label__pl	Zawsze jej ufałam.
__label__pl	Policyjny helikopter zlokalizował samochód Dana.
__label__pl	Wszyscy wiedzą, że jesteśmy zakochani z Tomem.
__label__pl	Tom został znaleziony martwy w jaskini za swoim domem.
__label__pl	Czy kiedykolwiek czekałeś w deszczu?
__label__pl	Sami musiał znaleźć pracę.
__label__pl	Jestem jedyną osobą, która może to robić.
__label__pl	Ojciec Toma cierpi na alzheimera.
__label__pl	Nie jesteśmy kompatybilni.
__label__pl	Tom nienawidzi, jak mu się przeszkadza, gdy się uczy.
__label__pl	Rozmawiam teraz z Tomem przez telefon.
__label__pl	Mary napisała do Toma wiele listów, gdy jej nie było.
__label__pl	Moje priorytety są inne.
__label__pl	On jest z Australii, co nie?
__label__pl	Tom powiedział mi, że sądził, że Mary będzie zrzędliwa.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary powiedzieli Johnowi, że mają łaskotki.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że ma nadzieję, że nigdy nie będzie musiał tego robić ponownie.
__label__pl	On oddał jej swoją starą kamerę.
__label__pl	Ona powiedziała, że nie wiedziała co zrobić.
__label__pl	Masz dwie opcje.
__label__pl	Masz dwie możliwości.
__label__pl	Layla powiedziała mi prawdę.
__label__pl	Wyjazd do Egiptu był dużym ryzykiem.
__label__pl	Czuliśmy, że nie mieliśmy innego wyboru niż to zrobić.
__label__pl	Jest wiele rzeczy, które musimy kupić.
__label__pl	Tom spytał mnie czy lubię łowić ryby.
__label__pl	To była moja wina, Panie Phillips. Ja ją podpuszczałem.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że to nie jedyny powód, dla którego chciał to zrobić.
__label__pl	Tom nie przypuszczał, że Mary będzie tak śliczna.
__label__pl	Odwróciła się w przerażeniu na widok tak dużej ilości krwii.
__label__pl	To nie było zawarte w umowie.
__label__pl	Tom prawie nigdy już nie chodzi pływać.
__label__pl	Tom nie chciał zadzwonić do swojego prawnika.
__label__pl	Sami i Layla zawsze jedli razem.
__label__pl	Nigdy nie będę taki sam.
__label__pl	Layla zostawiła swój telefon w swoim samochodzie.
__label__pl	Morderstwo spadło na nasze małe miasteczko w 1987, kiedy Layla Bakir została brutalnie zabita przez swojego chłopaka – Samiego Majida.
__label__pl	Tom pływał ze swoimi synami.
__label__pl	Emily jest moją najlepszą przyjaciółką.
__label__pl	Kiedyś potrafiłem mówić po łacinie, francusku i angielsku, ale teraz zapomniałem już je wszystkie.
__label__pl	Stowarzyszenie ma trzydziestu członków.
__label__pl	Jego życie wisi na decyzji sędziego.
__label__pl	Myślę, że Tom i Mary się uspokoili.
__label__pl	Mary pożałuje, że to zrobiła.
__label__pl	Nie wstydzę się swojego zachowania, pomimo tego, że wiem, że powinienem.
__label__pl	Ona zupełnie nic o nim nie wie.
__label__pl	Tam jest defekt.
__label__pl	Ta książka jest o torturze.
__label__pl	Czy Tom i Mary mi wierzą?
__label__pl	Pozostanę w tle.
__label__pl	Znałem Toma i Mary odkąd byli dziećmi.
__label__pl	Miałem nie więcej niż pięć dolarów.
__label__pl	To co mówisz może być prawdą...
__label__pl	Przymknij się, albo ja cię przymknę!
__label__pl	Wątpię, że Tom i Mary przyznają się, że nie wiedzą jak to zrobić.
__label__pl	Nie korzystam z tamtej strony, ponieważ obawiam się o to, w jaki sposób obchodzi się ona z informacjami swoich użytkowników.
__label__pl	Oni nie muszą odpowiadać.
__label__pl	Czemu nie chcesz pozwolić mi odejść?
__label__pl	Nie mogę przestać tego słuchać.
__label__pl	Yanni jest w innej części meczetu.
__label__pl	Tom jest kimś, kogo naprawdę podziwiam.
__label__pl	Tom wydawał się być dzisiaj inny.
__label__pl	Chcę jechać pociągiem.
__label__pl	Tom mógłby zatrzymać się w naszym domu, jeśli by chciał.
__label__pl	Tom był gotów do pracy.
__label__pl	Mam nadzieję, że nie oczekujesz ode mnie, że to dla ciebie kupię.
__label__pl	Chciałbym, żeby nie musiało tak być.
__label__pl	To jest maszyna do zabijania.
__label__pl	Oni zrobili to sami.
__label__pl	Jeśli on nie przyjmie tej pracy, ktoś inny to zrobi.
__label__pl	Zrobię to kiedy tylko będę miał czas.
__label__pl	Zrobię to tak szybko, jak będę miał czas.
__label__pl	On wygrał medal.
__label__pl	Czy ty zawsze dostajesz tego, czego chcesz?
__label__pl	Jak dostać się do kanadyjskiej ambasady?
__label__pl	Tego popołudnia planuję uczyć się angielskiego.
__label__pl	Jutro mnie nie będzie.
__label__pl	Dwie równoległe linie są równoodległe.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary ulepili bałwana.
__label__pl	Mogłabyś nauczyć się od niej kilku rzeczy.
__label__pl	Mógłbyś nauczyć się od niej kilku rzeczy.
__label__pl	Czy naprawdę chcesz zostać przez kolejne trzy dni?
__label__pl	Nie wiesz jak to jest poważne.
__label__pl	Zjadłem śniadanie o 7:30.
__label__pl	Twój plan wydaje się być najlepszym.
__label__pl	Nie wiem co ci powiedzieć.
__label__pl	Tom dał mi tę grę.
__label__pl	Tom mówi, że czuje się dobrze.
__label__pl	Jestem żoną Toma.
__label__pl	Czy byłoby możliwe, żebyśmy zrobili to dzisiaj?
__label__pl	Wyglądasz na wykończonego, ziomek. Wydaje mi się, że potrzebujesz wziąć chwilę przerwy od pisania.
__label__pl	Urodziłem się 3 kwietnia 1950 roku.
__label__pl	Tom jest wściekły.
__label__pl	Na co jesteś wściekły?
__label__pl	Jasne, że jestem wściekły.
__label__pl	Miłość jest do dupy.
__label__pl	Niezły tyłek!
__label__pl	Rusz dupę!
__label__pl	Złapałeś mnie za tyłek!
__label__pl	Złapał mnie za tyłek!
__label__pl	Czy mógłbyś nie palić w tym pokoju?
__label__pl	Zostanę odebrany.
__label__pl	Przyniosę jeszcze jeden ręcznik.
__label__pl	Tom rzucił ręcznik.
__label__pl	Co spowodowało powódź?
__label__pl	Mamy obowiązek pomóc.
__label__pl	Czy jest jakiś problem?
__label__pl	Tom złapał mysz.
__label__pl	Czasami przesadzam.
__label__pl	Uważaj, podłoga jest śliska.
__label__pl	Pozamiataj podłogę!
__label__pl	Wyrzuciłem moje buty.
__label__pl	Wyrzuciłam moje buty.
__label__pl	Każdy kocha muzykę.
__label__pl	Nie pij alkoholu.
__label__pl	Wydajesz się chory.
__label__pl	Każdy zna każdego.
__label__pl	Tam nic nie ma.
__label__pl	Nie możesz nas zwyciężyć.
__label__pl	Czy masz duży dom?
__label__pl	Zostań! Nie uciekaj!
__label__pl	Zamknij drzwi na klucz!
__label__pl	Jutro wyjeżdżamy.
__label__pl	Od kiedy to potrzebujesz?
__label__pl	Kochałem ją.
__label__pl	Kochałam go.
__label__pl	Ty piłeś?
__label__pl	Pojechałem wczoraj do centrum handlowego.
__label__pl	Ceny na elektryczność rosną.
__label__pl	Dzisiaj zadali mi dużo lekcji.
__label__pl	Czytanie jest jednym z moich hobby.
__label__pl	Nie było się czym chwalić.
__label__pl	Widziałem ptaka lecącego po niebie.
__label__pl	Chciałbym posłuchać muzyki pop.
__label__pl	Widziałem ptaka przelatującego nad drzewem.
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie rzucimy monetą?
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie sprawdzimy?
__label__pl	Nie mam dziś ochoty palić.
__label__pl	Udało mi się za pierwszym podejściem.
__label__pl	Dobrze mi!
__label__pl	Tom szaleje za Mary.
__label__pl	Tom jest tak duży jak ja.
__label__pl	Tom i ja jesteśmy wściekli na Mary.
__label__pl	Tom jest tak stary jak ja.
__label__pl	Czy to tak czy nie?
__label__pl	Tom jest równie zajęty jak Mary.
__label__pl	Czy to w porządku, jeśli cię przytulę?
__label__pl	Bardzo lubię Toma i Mary.
__label__pl	Toki pona to dobry język.
__label__pl	Dzwonię, żeby ci podziękować.
__label__pl	Dzownię, żeby coś zareklamować.
__label__pl	Dzwonię, żeby umówić się na spotkanie.
__label__pl	Dzwonię, żeby zgłosić zgubiony portfel.
__label__pl	Dzwonię, żeby powiedzieć, czego potrzebuję.
__label__pl	Dzwonię, żeby przypomnieć ci o naszych planach obiadowych.
__label__pl	Dzwonię, żeby powiedzieć, o której musisz tu jutro być.
__label__pl	Tom nie jest tak gruby jak ja.
__label__pl	Czy mogę otworzyć puszkę?
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że w przyszłym miesiącu skończy trzynaście lat.
__label__pl	Czy to w porządku, jeśli pójdę w dżinsach?
__label__pl	Tom wie o mnie więcej niż ktokolwiek inny.
__label__pl	Widziałem, jak Tom został potrącony przez samochód.
__label__pl	Nie wierzę, że Tom jest mordercą.
__label__pl	Tom ma tyle samo lat ile ja.
__label__pl	Mam pracę, którą muszę wykonać.
__label__pl	Nigdy nie zapomnę wyrazu twarzy Toma.
__label__pl	Czy pamiętałeś, aby kupić kwiaty dla Mary?
__label__pl	Hałas przeszkadzał mi w czytaniu.
__label__pl	Tom nie miał dużo czasu.
__label__pl	Chcę, żebyś wiedziała, że naprawdę nie chciałem tego zrobić.
__label__pl	Czy Tom ma plecak?
__label__pl	Potrzebuję ołówka. Czy mogę pożyczyć jeden z twoich?
__label__pl	Wysłałam do niego wiadomość.
__label__pl	Wolę o tym nie mówić.
__label__pl	Wysłałam do niej wiadomość.
__label__pl	Wysłałem do niej wiadomość.
__label__pl	Wysłałem do niego wiadomość.
__label__pl	Wysłałem wiadomość do Toma.
__label__pl	Wysłałam wiadomość do Toma.
__label__pl	Wysłałem do nich wiadomość.
__label__pl	Wysłałam do nich wiadomość.
__label__pl	Wysłałam Ci wiadomość.
__label__pl	Wysłałem im wiadomość.
__label__pl	Wysłałam im wiadomość.
__label__pl	Wysłałem mu wiadomość.
__label__pl	Wysłałam mu wiadomość.
__label__pl	Wysłałam jej wiadomość.
__label__pl	Wysłałem jej wiadomość.
__label__pl	Wysłałam tobie wiadomość.
__label__pl	Wysłałem tobie wiadomość.
__label__pl	Wysłałem Tomowi wiadomość.
__label__pl	Wysłałam Tomowi wiadomość.
__label__pl	Nie wiedziałem, kiedy trzeba wyłączyć maszynę.
__label__pl	Wbił gwóźdź w ścianę i powiesił obraz.
__label__pl	Wbiła gwóźdź w ścianę i powiesił obraz.
__label__pl	Światła zmieniły się na czerwone.
__label__pl	Sprawdziłem słowo w słowniku.

__label__pl	Sprawdził słowo w słowniku.
__label__pl	Sprawdziła słowo w słowniku.
__label__pl	Co on sprawdzał?
__label__pl	Mary próbowała wymacać drogę z ciemnej piwnicy, ale uderzyła głową w belkę i zemdlała.
__label__pl	Jaka jest twoja ulubiona samogłoska?
__label__pl	Przymiotniki kończą się samogłoską "a".
__label__pl	Francuski ma o wiele więcej samogłosek niż japoński.
__label__pl	Ten traktat zapewnia pokój.
__label__pl	Nikt nie może tego zapewnić.
__label__pl	Robert odwiedza mnie od czasu do czasu.
__label__pl	Od czasu do czasu mówię po francusku.
__label__pl	Był sporadyczny śmiech.
__label__pl	Ta szuflada jest pełna rozmaitych rzeczy.
__label__pl	Ta szuflada jest pełna różnych rzeczy.
__label__pl	Wybierz losowo trzy książki.
__label__pl	Tom zjechał na zjeżdżalni.
__label__pl	Czy to słuszny powód?
__label__pl	Czy nadal wolno nam to robić?
__label__pl	Pomógłbym, gdybyś tego chciała.
__label__pl	Pomogłabym, gdybyś tego chciał.
__label__pl	Tom pomagał mi uczyć się francuskiego.
__label__pl	Musisz być bardziej szczegółowy.
__label__pl	Musisz być bardziej szczegółowa.
__label__pl	Czy łazienka jest posprzątana?
__label__pl	Czy umyłeś już zęby?
__label__pl	Wyczyściłem sobie buty.
__label__pl	Nie wyczyściłem tego.
__label__pl	Ten ząb się rusza.
__label__pl	Tom niechętnie poszedł do dentysty.
__label__pl	Moja córka ma jutro wizytę u dentysty.
__label__pl	Co cię sprowadza?
__label__pl	Nie pocałowała mnie.
__label__pl	Chcę być mądry.
__label__pl	On chce być mądry.
__label__pl	Ona chce być mądra.
__label__pl	Najpierw pomyśl!
__label__pl	Myśl pozytywnie!
__label__pl	Myśl o śmierci.
__label__pl	Pozwól mi pomyśleć.
__label__pl	Niech pomyślę.
__label__pl	Pomyśl o nich.
__label__pl	Pomyśl o jutrze.
__label__pl	Myśl o jutrze.
__label__pl	Myśl samodzielnie.
__label__pl	Myśl za siebie.
__label__pl	Przemyśl to!
__label__pl	Rozmyślam.
__label__pl	Każdy tak myśli.
__label__pl	Wszystcy tak myślą.
__label__pl	Myśl przed działaniem!
__label__pl	Pomyśl, potem mów.
__label__pl	Tak myślisz?
__label__pl	Myśl o Bogu.
__label__pl	On myśli szybko.
__label__pl	Zatrzymaj sie i pomyśl.
__label__pl	Chcę zrozumieć sens życia.
__label__pl	Chcę zrozumieć znaczenie życia.
__label__pl	Jutro będzie nowy dzień.
__label__pl	Kiedy są w niebezpieczeństwie uciekają.

__label__pl	Daktyle poprawiają funkcjonowanie mózgu.
__label__pl	Chroń środowisko!
__label__pl	Przystosował się do swojego środowiska.
__label__pl	Nie chcę z Panem mówić.
__label__pl	Tom przypadkiem posolił sobie herbatę.
__label__pl	Coś się tu dzieje.
__label__pl	Mogę już zejść?
__label__pl	Tom może jutro przyjść.
__label__pl	Wiem, że Tom opuścił już Boston.
__label__pl	Wiem, że Tom pojechał już do Bostonu.
__label__pl	Nie bądź zachłanny.
__label__pl	Nie bądź chciwy.
__label__pl	Wolę banany niż jabłka.
__label__pl	Gdzie mogę kupić fartuchy?
__label__pl	Te fartuchy są wygodne.
__label__pl	Ogólnie mam 5 dzieci.
__label__pl	Ogólnie, to była fajna wyprawa.
__label__pl	Tom mówi po angielsku tak samo dobrze jak wy.
__label__pl	Tom tylko próbuje ci pomóc.

__label__pl	Omijam handlarzy organami szerokim łukiem.
__label__pl	Należy omijać szerokim łukiem wszelkie psie kupy na chodniku.
__label__pl	Tom był naprawdę spóźniony, prawda?
__label__pl	Lubimy naszych sąsiadów.
__label__pl	Tom nie chciał zapraszać Mary.
__label__pl	Powiedz, jeśli jesteś zmęczony.
__label__pl	Powiedz, jeśli jesteś zmęczona.
__label__pl	Mam dopiero osiemnaście lat.
__label__pl	Zdobył pierwszą nagrodę.
__label__pl	Właśnie się tu przeprowadziłem.
__label__pl	Właśnie spotkałem Toma.
__label__pl	To nie pierwszy raz.
__label__pl	Twoje zdanie nie zostało dodane, ponieważ już istnieje następujące.
__label__pl	Niech pani położy dziecko na plecach!
__label__pl	Tom ma silne bóle.
__label__pl	Bardzo mnie tu boli.
__label__pl	Mam tu silne bóle.
__label__pl	Nie wiem, gdzie iść.
__label__pl	Nie wiem, dokąd się udać.
__label__pl	Byłam za mała.
__label__pl	Byłem za mały.
__label__pl	Mój dom jest za mały.
__label__pl	Moje buty są za małe.
__label__pl	Dorastałem w małym miasteczku.
__label__pl	Powiedz Tomowi o nas.
__label__pl	Kwiat jest niebieski.
__label__pl	Nikt nie wie, gdzie poszedł Bill.
__label__pl	Tom mieszka ze mną.
__label__pl	Tom chciał walczyć.
__label__pl	Oni zawsze narzekają.
__label__pl	Nie wie nic o polityce.
__label__pl	Opiekuj się Tomem.
__label__pl	Oni wiedzą, że potrzebują pomocy
__label__pl	Wiem o czym mówisz
__label__pl	Chciałbym wiedzieć więcej o tym miejscu.
__label__pl	Ja naprawdę nie wiem o czym mówisz.
__label__pl	Powtórz to jeszcze parę razy.
__label__pl	Nie wiem czy Tom i Mary są Kanadajczykami czy nie.
__label__pl	Wiesz, który z tych chłopców to Tom?
__label__pl	Czy zamierzasz sprzedać te obrazy?
__label__pl	Tom i Mary są zazdrośni, co nie?
__label__pl	Uczę francuskiego w szkole średniej.
__label__pl	Dobrze was znowu widziеć.
__label__pl	Do szkoły idziemy pół godziny.
__label__pl	Chcę, abyś ze mną pojechała do Australii.
__label__pl	Jestem uczulony na mak.
__label__pl	Przetłumacz to.
__label__pl	Nie musimy się spieszyć, mamy mnóstwo czasu.
__label__pl	Tomek wysłuchał uważnie kazania księdza.
__label__pl	No to, ni owo.
__label__pl	Nie wiem, jak to powiedzieć
__label__pl	Czy dostaniemy jakąś kolację?
__label__pl	Myślałem, że mówiłem ci, żebyś nie przychodził.
__label__pl	Ulica jest dzisiaj wyludniona.
__label__pl	Ile pieniędzy dałeś Tomowi?
__label__pl	Zaśpiewał dla niej jej ulubioną piosenkę.

__label__pl	Prawda jest taka, że Tom nie jest tak naprawdę moim bratem.
__label__pl	Oni dostali wszystko czego potrzebowali.
__label__pl	Nie pozwolę, aby Tom ciebie zranił.
__label__pl	Kogo widział Tom?
__label__pl	To jest duża sprawa dla mnie.
__label__pl	Tom zranił się w nogę, i nie może pójść dzisiaj pływać.
__label__pl	Czy możesz mi pomóc znaleźć moje klucze?

__label__pl	To prawda w wielu przypadkach.
__label__pl	On z nią pracuje.
__label__pl	Jest pięć po trzeciej.
__label__pl	Patrzę na ten kwiat.
__label__pl	Tom nie wygląda na zadowolonego że nas widzi.
__label__pl	Nigdy więcej nie marnuj swojego czasu na myślenie o tym.
__label__pl	Czy on naprawdę to zrobił?
__label__pl	Ona próbowała ukryć swoje obawy.
__label__pl	On stoi twardo na ziemi.
__label__pl	Tom tak naprawdę nie płakał.
__label__pl	Tom nie planował tego zrobić.
__label__pl	Tom jest chrześcijaninem tylko z nazwy. On nigdy nie chodzi do kościoła.
__label__pl	Tom nie chcę tego robić samemu.

__label__pl	Tom ma nadzieję, że zda egzamin.
__label__pl	Tom nie wiedział, gdzie powinien usiąść.

__label__pl	To naprawdę nie jest teraz ważne.
__label__pl	Tom poszedł umyć ręce.
__label__pl	Tom poszedł surfować z Mary.
__label__pl	Ciągle mówisz o Tomie?
__label__pl	Ona mówi za szybko.

__label__pl	Żona go zostawiła i został zwolniony.
__label__pl	Poznałem Toma w trakcie podróży pociągiem.
__label__pl	Koń, na którego Tom postawił, dotarł ostatni do celu.
__label__pl	Może Tom ma po prostu szczęście.
__label__pl	Tom nie mógł jej pomóc.
__label__pl	Doświadczenie to suma wszystkich naszych błędów.
__label__pl	Tom miał trzy.
__label__pl	Tom dobrze gra w piłkę (nożną).
__label__pl	Nie mam ochoty iść do restauracji.
__label__pl	Ja ich kochałam.
__label__pl	Ja ich kochałem.
__label__pl	Myśliwi zabili dzika.
__label__pl	On zabił dzika.

__label__pl	Dzik zabił już kilku myśliwych, którzy podeszli zbyt blisko.
__label__pl	Lenin twierdził, że nie ma lepszego bolszewika niż Trocki.
__label__pl	Dlaczego bolszewicy przenieśli stolicę z Piotrogrodu do Moskwy?
__label__pl	Stary bolszewik nie mógł powstrzymać łez.
__label__pl	Opowiedz mi o swoim ojcu.
__label__pl	Nie dotykaj niebieskiego przycisku.
__label__pl	To nic Cię nie kosztuje.

__label__pl	Czy mamy jakiś wpływ?
__label__pl	Nie możemy dłużej milczeć.
__label__pl	Czy wyglądam jak twoja służąca?
__label__pl	Can you read this text for me?
__label__pl	Postawię moje pytanie w inny sposób.
__label__pl	Czy możesz przeczytać dla mnie ten dokument?
__label__pl	Moja matka mnie skarciła.
__label__pl	To naprawdę niefortunne.
__label__pl	Slogany nie zastępują rozwiązań.
__label__pl	W takich sytuacjach trzeba być cierpliwym i zachować spokój.
__label__pl	Nie mam siły.
__label__pl	Musimy natychmiast wyjść.
__label__pl	Nie ma czasu do stracenia.
__label__pl	Nie zamówiliśmy tego.
__label__pl	To głupia propozycja.
__label__pl	Nie jestem gotowy aby to zrobić.
__label__pl	Lepiej nie prowadzić.
__label__pl	W rzece pierzemy nasze ubrania.
__label__pl	Pierzemy nasze rzeczy w rzece.

__label__pl	Mogę dać ci kilka wskazówek, jak wygrać grę.
__label__pl	Strażnicy pilnują, aby wszystkie drzwi w muzeum były zamknięte.

__label__pl	Poszedłem w góry.
__label__pl	Jest w tym trochę prawdy.
__label__pl	Słucham nowej piosenki.
__label__pl	Twoja prawa skarpeta jest na lewą stronę.
__label__pl	Udałem się w góry.
__label__pl	Żadna z dwóch odpowiedzi nie jest prawidłowa.

__label__pl	Mój notatnik jest pełny.
__label__pl	Potrzebuję nowej kamery internetowej.
__label__pl	Życie jest drogie.
__label__pl	Kto chce znowu iść?

__label__pl	W każdym razie, jaki to dzień?
__label__pl	Teraz rozumiem, co masz na myśli.
__label__pl	"Kawa?" "Tak proszę."
__label__pl	Obiecuję dać z siebie wszystko.
__label__pl	Och.
__label__pl	Niestety.
__label__pl	Dziki!
__label__pl	Przejście!
__label__pl	Dołączyć!
__label__pl	Na południe.
__label__pl	Wyraźnie!

__label__pl	Są rzeczy, które możesz zrobić, aby rozwiązać ten problem.
__label__pl	Czy pamiętałeś o wyniesieniu śmieci?
__label__pl	Tom zapomniał wynieść śmieci.

__label__pl	Ze względu na wysoki głos Tom śpiewa w chórze żeńskim.

__label__pl	Tom prawdopodobnie będzie na zewnątrz.
__label__pl	Staram się częściej tu przychodzić.
__label__pl	Layla pragnęła zarówno ramion kochanka, jak i bogactwa męża.
__label__pl	To są buty narciarskie Toma.

__label__pl	Poznałam Toma, zanim skończyłam szkołę średnią, ale Mary poznałam dopiero wiele lat później.
__label__pl	Po prostu rób to, co mówi twoja matka.
__label__pl	Uczę się języka nahuatl.

__label__pl	Nie doprowadzaj Toma do płaczu.
__label__pl	Jeśli dostał 10 na 10 w teście, to dlatego, że oszukiwał.
__label__pl	Wynagrodzenie będzie wypłacane proporcjonalnie do wykonanej pracy.
__label__pl	Zastanawiam się, czy Tom i Mary naprawdę są źli.

__label__pl	Kapusta, kalafior, brokuły i brukselka to odmiany tego samego gatunku.

__label__pl	Kapuśniak i barszcz to tradycyjne potrawy zarówno w Rosji, jak i Europie Wschodniej.

__label__pl	Tom pokazał nam zdjęcie jego matki.
__label__pl	On wie dobrze jak korzystać z komputera.

__label__pl	Próbowali wszystkiego.
__label__pl	Tom odrzucił pomysł.
__label__pl	Tom jest wysokim mężczyzną.
__label__pl	Zostaw nas w spokoju.
__label__pl	Nie uda im się.
__label__pl	Jakie książki kupiłeś?
__label__pl	Jestem głodny. A Ty?
__label__pl	Mogę nauczyć Cię gotować.
__label__pl	Nie chcę być tobą.
__label__pl	To jest smutne.
__label__pl	Nie możesz mi rozkazywać.
__label__pl	Lubię te okulary przeciwsłoneczne.
__label__pl	Jestem jedynakiem.
__label__pl	Czekałem na Ciebie.
__label__pl	Która torba jest Twoja?
__label__pl	Wstań.
__label__pl	Dzwonię do niej bardzo często.
__label__pl	Tom jest dobrym uczniem.
__label__pl	To jest moja przyjaciółka Rachel. Chodziliśmy razem do liceum.
__label__pl	Skąd mam wiedzieć?
__label__pl	Narysuj mi owcę.
__label__pl	Głosuj na Toma.
__label__pl	Jak mógłbym się oprzeć?
__label__pl	Nigdy nie rozmawiamy.
__label__pl	Nie możesz tu jeść.
__label__pl	Przyślij Toma.
__label__pl	Daj mi znać.
__label__pl	Mam rozkazy.
__label__pl	Tom był szalony.
__label__pl	Nigdy Cię nie okłamałem.
__label__pl	Tom pożegnał się.
__label__pl	Kocham gry wideo.
__label__pl	Też jestem zajęty.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy przyjaciółmi.
__label__pl	Tom wygląda na silnego.
__label__pl	Mógłbym Cię pocałować.
__label__pl	Kto to sprzedaje?
__label__pl	Masz czas.
__label__pl	Kto chce cię zabić?
__label__pl	Zjadłem pomarańczę.
__label__pl	Ach! Gdybym był bogaty, kupiłbym sobie dom w Hiszpanii.
__label__pl	Jestem w szkole.
__label__pl	No weź! Mów do mnie, Trang.
__label__pl	Lubisz pikantne jedzenie?
__label__pl	Poczekaj, proszę.
__label__pl	Wyglądasz na Europejczyka.
__label__pl	Nie idź jeszcze.
__label__pl	Trzymaj głowę nisko.
__label__pl	Nie było tam ani żywej duszy.
__label__pl	To jest bardzo pouczający artykuł.
__label__pl	Powinno być możliwe.
__label__pl	Uczył grupę Indyjskich chłopców.
__label__pl	To przekleństwo.
__label__pl	Czy mogę zapytać dlaczego?
__label__pl	Jakże zmieniają się czasy.
__label__pl	Idź i sprowadź Toma.
__label__pl	Chcę, żeby Tom był szczęśliwy.
__label__pl	Każdy lubi pieniądze.
__label__pl	Wysyłam Ci książkę.
__label__pl	Pójdę to zrobić.
__label__pl	Wiesz, to nie zadziała.
__label__pl	Załóż to.
__label__pl	Ptak był o połowę mniejszy od orła.
__label__pl	Wszyscy chłopcy krzyczeli.
__label__pl	Powinienem ostrzec Cię wcześniej.
__label__pl	Byłem szalony, że to zrobiłem.
__label__pl	Tylko to się liczy.
__label__pl	Gdzie są Twoje pieniądze?
__label__pl	Będę za tobą bardzo tęsknił.
__label__pl	Mam Twój klucz.
__label__pl	Tom może zaufać Mary.
__label__pl	Nauka wymaga czasu.
__label__pl	Dlaczego miałbym kłamać?
__label__pl	Proszę być cierpliwym. To wymaga czasu.
__label__pl	Piję herbatę.
__label__pl	Jakim językiem mówi się w Twoim kraju?
__label__pl	Podnieś to.
__label__pl	Możesz teraz dokończyć swój esej.
__label__pl	Kim są ci faceci?
__label__pl	Mogę już iść do domu?
__label__pl	Płakałem dzisiaj.
__label__pl	Zawsze jestem humorzasty.
__label__pl	Odmawiam.
__label__pl	To nasz dom.
__label__pl	Nie mów kłamstw.
__label__pl	Zajęcia zaczynają się ponownie wkrótce.
__label__pl	Nadjeżdża pociąg.
__label__pl	Byłem torturowany.
__label__pl	Wiem to.
__label__pl	Czy masz jakiś dowód tożsamości?
__label__pl	Będę miły.
__label__pl	Jestem bardzo chudy.
__label__pl	Jestem kiepskim piosenkarzem.
__label__pl	Żołnierze zginęli.
__label__pl	Tom uśmiechnął się i uniósł kapelusz.
__label__pl	Drzwi sejfu były otwarte.
__label__pl	Tom niedługo będzie gotowy.
__label__pl	Przybyłem do Australii trzy dni temu.
__label__pl	Myślę, że Tom to dla nas zrobi.
__label__pl	Jeśli piłka cię trafi, odpadasz.
__label__pl	Proszę, nie zaczynaj teraz.
__label__pl	Tom jest silniejszy od Ciebie.
__label__pl	Przyjdź proszę.
__label__pl	Tom przyjął wyzwanie.
__label__pl	Tom mi nie pomoże.
__label__pl	Nie będzie aż tak źle.
__label__pl	Czy ta praca jest ciężka?
__label__pl	Nie dąsaj się teraz.
__label__pl	Tom zatrudnił Mary.
__label__pl	Wiem, kiedy zrezygnować.
__label__pl	Tom kupił piwo posługując się fałszywym dowodem osobistym.
__label__pl	Wiem, gdzie zabierają Toma.
__label__pl	Ten chleb pachnie bardzo dobrze.
__label__pl	Tom może widzieć duchy.
__label__pl	Czy to legalne?
__label__pl	Tom zniżył głos.
__label__pl	Nie jestem Tomem.
__label__pl	To jest moja kuchnia.
__label__pl	Chcielibyśmy tego.
__label__pl	Jestem zdruzgotany.
__label__pl	Tom siedział i czytał książkę.
__label__pl	Zgaś ten ogień.
__label__pl	Twój jest gorszy.
__label__pl	Znam ją z imienia.
__label__pl	Są w samochodzie.
__label__pl	Skręciłem w prawo.
__label__pl	Koniec żartów.
__label__pl	Zjedzmy na mieście.
__label__pl	Powiedziałem Tomowi, że nie wygram.
__label__pl	Przeprowadziłem się w zeszłym miesiącu.
__label__pl	Jesteś tu z kimś?
__label__pl	Umierali.
__label__pl	Tom jest moim ojczymem.
__label__pl	Tom żyje!
__label__pl	Tom zamienia się w słuch.
__label__pl	Czy uważasz, że angielski jest trudny?
__label__pl	Potrzebuję moich butów.
__label__pl	Wyglądasz na trochę zmęczonego.
__label__pl	Byłem w Bostonie trzy miesiące temu.
__label__pl	Nie jestem nieśmiały.
__label__pl	Ten kod nie został napisany zbyt dobrze.
__label__pl	Czuję się odświeżony.
__label__pl	Tom nie może się z tobą ożenić.
__label__pl	Wiem kto jest złodziejem.
__label__pl	Spędziłem cały dzień na czytaniu tej powieści.
__label__pl	Zrobiłem co mi kazano.
__label__pl	Naprawdę sądzisz, że to zrujnuje moją reputację?
__label__pl	Tom przyjdzie.
__label__pl	Tom pił prosto z puszki.
__label__pl	Obiad jem zwykle o siódmej.
__label__pl	Czy to aktualne zdjęcie?
__label__pl	Ostatnia osoba, której opowiedziałem o swoim pomyśle uznała mnie za wariata.
__label__pl	Tom próbował pomóc swoim rodzicom.
__label__pl	W tym tkwi problem.
__label__pl	No to mamy problem...
__label__pl	Och, tam jest motyl!
__label__pl	Żartujesz sobie ze mnie?!
__label__pl	Nie chcę być lamusem; chcę być cool!!!
__label__pl	Ameryka to wspaniałe miejsce, jeśli jesteś tu po to, by zarabiać pieniądze.
__label__pl	Tak tylko mówię!
__label__pl	Byłoby to coś, co musiałbym zaprogramować.
__label__pl	Dlaczego nas nie odwiedzisz?
__label__pl	Czy to źle?
__label__pl	To stary wyjadacz.
__label__pl	Jesteś najwyższy.
__label__pl	Złamałeś zasadę.
__label__pl	Bardzo się zmienili.
__label__pl	Bardzo się zmieniłeś!
__label__pl	Oto twoja reszta.
__label__pl	Lekarz Toma powiedział, że może już nigdy nie chodzić.
__label__pl	Wiem czemu to zrobiłeś.
__label__pl	Powinienem był posłuchać Mary.
__label__pl	Widziałem pięknego ptaka.
__label__pl	Czy wszystkie są takie same?
__label__pl	Gdzie są jajka, proszę?
__label__pl	Pomóż Tom!
__label__pl	Cześć! Pracujesz tutaj?
__label__pl	Mój kot jest czarny.
__label__pl	Pożyczę ci mój notatnik.
__label__pl	Czym zajmuje się twoja ciocia?
__label__pl	Znam twoje imię.
__label__pl	Myślę, że się mylisz.
__label__pl	Wszędzie czujesz się jak w domu?
__label__pl	Jesteś dobrym uczniem.
__label__pl	Pożegnania zawsze są smutne.
__label__pl	Jesteś wrzodem na tyłku!
__label__pl	To ślepy zaułek.
__label__pl	Nie wiem, co jest gorsze.
__label__pl	Kto kupuje tego typu sztukę?
__label__pl	Tak! Wygrałem dwa razy z rzędu!
__label__pl	Obcokrajowcy mnie intrygują.
__label__pl	Obcokrajowcy mnie ciekawią.
__label__pl	Lubię światło świec.
__label__pl	Nie powinienem był się wylogowywać.
__label__pl	Wylogowanie się było złym pomysłem.
__label__pl	Nie wiedziałem skąd to się wzięło.
__label__pl	Znoszenie może być nie do zniesienia.
__label__pl	Wyprać przed pierwszym założeniem.
__label__pl	Rób co ci każe.
__label__pl	"Ach!" to wtrącenie.
__label__pl	Te rzeczy nie są moje!
__label__pl	Nie lubisz jabłek?
__label__pl	Kim chcesz być?
__label__pl	Jak wysoki jesteś?
__label__pl	Dała mu książkę.
__label__pl	Mogłeś to zrobić.
__label__pl	Wcale się nie mylisz.
__label__pl	Masz mnie za głupca?
__label__pl	Myślisz, że jestem idiotą?
__label__pl	Podjąłem zbyt wiele złych decyzji.
__label__pl	Tom nie będzie z tobą rozmawiał.
__label__pl	Tom nie zamknął jeszcze okien.
__label__pl	Dokąd oni jadą?
__label__pl	Nie możesz tak po prostu odejść od tego bałaganu.
__label__pl	Tom też umie pływać.
__label__pl	Tak należy to zrobić.
__label__pl	Wiem, że musisz być szczęśliwy.
__label__pl	Nauka niderlandzkiego nie jest trudna.
__label__pl	Tom nigdy niczego nie kończy.
__label__pl	Te ołówki są tego samego koloru.
__label__pl	Ile pieniędzy miesięcznie wydaje Tom?
__label__pl	Tom naprawdę na mnie nakrzyczał.
__label__pl	Woda rozszerza się podczas zamarzania.
__label__pl	Nie mogę ufać takiemu człowiekowi.
__label__pl	Zostałeś kiedykolwiek zwolniony z pracy?
__label__pl	Wiem, że niedawno przeszedłeś na emeryturę.
__label__pl	Lubię corn-dogi.
__label__pl	Trzymaj się z dala od trawy.
__label__pl	Ktoś do mnie pisze.
__label__pl	Zastanawiam się czy Tom to dla mnie zrobi.
__label__pl	Wykiwano cię.
__label__pl	Zostaliście oszukani.
__label__pl	Czy w ogóle to czytałeś?
__label__pl	Możesz to zrobić!
__label__pl	Twój angielski jest coraz lepszy.
__label__pl	Niezła dupa!
__label__pl	Tom jest naprawdę otyły.
__label__pl	Tom dał mi rower na urodziny.
__label__pl	Wiem, że masz kłopoty.

__label__pl	Masz silną wolę.
__label__pl	Możesz używać tego samochodu.
__label__pl	Dlaczego memy są tak popularne?
__label__pl	Kiedy będziesz wolny?
__label__pl	Lubisz memy?

__label__pl	Twoje włosy są za długie.
__label__pl	Masz na głowie jadowitego pająka.
__label__pl	Będziemy dziś dużo jeść, więc mam nadzieję, że nie jesteś na diecie.
__label__pl	Dostałem w twarz gumowym pająkiem.
__label__pl	Idź i porozmawiaj z moim kolegą.
__label__pl	Skontaktuj się z moim kolegą.
__label__pl	Opowiedz mi o tym!
__label__pl	Manhua to chińskie słowo oznaczające komiks.
__label__pl	Jaka jest różnica między manhuą, manhwą i mangą?
__label__pl	Czy Tom wiedział, że nie mógłbyś tego zrobić?
__label__pl	Nikt nie spodziewał się, że on wygra.
__label__pl	Ona jest naprawdę zazdrosna, czyż nie?
__label__pl	Nie jestem bogaczem.
__label__pl	Boicie się śmierci?
__label__pl	Najlepsze słowa przychodzą do ciebie, gdy jest już za późno!
__label__pl	Otwarte?
__label__pl	Najlepszym sposobem by nauczyć się francuskiego jest żyć w kraju frankojęzycznym.

__label__pl	Chciałeś je zabić?
__label__pl	Jest brzydki.
__label__pl	Ta powieść mnie nudzi.
__label__pl	Zapomnij. To nie jest tego warte.
__label__pl	Nie spieszmy się zbytnio.
__label__pl	Muszę brać lekarstwa.
__label__pl	Pracuję nawet w niedzielę.
__label__pl	To stało się dawno temu.
__label__pl	Urodził się 28 lipca 1888 roku.
__label__pl	Ona jest na mnie zła.
__label__pl	Tom robi tosty francuskie.
__label__pl	Oczywiście, że ją kocham.
__label__pl	To moja przyjaciółka Mari.
__label__pl	Myślę, że to pierwszy raz, kiedy Tom zrobił to bez pomocy.
__label__pl	Nie możesz tego przegapić.

__label__pl	Niemiecki przemysł samochodowy produkuje znakomite auta.
__label__pl	Czy ten koń jest czarny?
__label__pl	Impreza u Toma była nudna.
__label__pl	Nigdy wcześniej nie słyszałem Toma mówiącego po francusku.
__label__pl	Tom pomógł Mary się przygotować.
__label__pl	Nasz projekt grupowy wypadł znakomicie.
__label__pl	Nie było sensu szukać ich ani chwili dłużej.

__label__pl	Odpręż się
__label__pl	Ja też nie!
__label__pl	Kot jest biały.
__label__pl	Chodź, jeżeli możesz.
__label__pl	Czy podejmiesz się tej pracy?
__label__pl	Jak donoszą gazety, mężczyzna w końcu się przyznał.
__label__pl	Ta praca jest źle wykonana.
__label__pl	Wziąłeś zły klucz.
__label__pl	Myślę, że jesteś mi winien całusa.
__label__pl	Mam dwa zepsute zęby.
__label__pl	Muiriel lubi mnie ostatnio denerwować.
__label__pl	To jest trudniejsze niż myślisz.

__label__pl	Gdybym tylko mógł Ci pomóc.
__label__pl	To nie ma nic z tym wspólnego.
__label__pl	Uwielbiam sok pomarańczowy.
__label__pl	Twoja naiwność Cię zgubi.
__label__pl	Jesteś bardzo naiwny, mój przyjacielu.

__label__pl	Moglibyście mi powiedzieć jak to zrobić?
__label__pl	Muszę Cię o coś zapytać.

__label__pl	Nie sądzę, żebym miał czas.
__label__pl	Mogłeś coś usłyszeć.
__label__pl	Mogłaś coś usłyszeć.
__label__pl	To jest ta dziewczyna, która ma ojca doktora.
__label__pl	Dam jej przepis.
__label__pl	Nie pozwolę Ci zabrać Toma.
__label__pl	Spotkałeś go wczoraj?
__label__pl	Spotkałaś go wczoraj?
__label__pl	Nie spędzam dużo czasu w domu.
__label__pl	Trudne to było do zrobienia?

__label__pl	Nie mogę im nic powiedzieć.
__label__pl	Mógłbym zadzwonić.
__label__pl	Mogłabym zadzwonić.
__label__pl	Nie mogę brać tego na poważnie.
__label__pl	Ona może przyjść.
__label__pl	On może przyjść.
__label__pl	Ona musi być chora.
__label__pl	Mam doświadczenie.
__label__pl	Byłam zmęczona po pracy.
__label__pl	Byłem zmęczony po pracy.
__label__pl	Rozgośćcie się.
__label__pl	Jak się wszyscy mają?
__label__pl	Aby to zrobić, trzeba podjąć ryzyko.
__label__pl	To jest moje?
__label__pl	Kocham chleb.
__label__pl	Tom o tym wie.
__label__pl	Znasz ją.
__label__pl	Poddali się.
__label__pl	Jestem tchórzem.
__label__pl	Weź mój płaszcz.
__label__pl	Wróć do środka.
__label__pl	Jest im zimno.
__label__pl	Są zimni.
__label__pl	Witaj w domu.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy kwita.
__label__pl	Chcemy Toma.
__label__pl	Tom ją zobaczył.
__label__pl	Jestem popularny.
__label__pl	Tom był smutny.
__label__pl	Chcę Mary.
__label__pl	Pytaj o Toma.
__label__pl	To jest zepsute.
__label__pl	Rób jak mówię.
__label__pl	Kocham wołowinę.
__label__pl	Czy to jest sztuka?
__label__pl	Nie oszukuj.
__label__pl	Kocham życie.
__label__pl	Jestem egoistą.
__label__pl	Jestem samolubny.
__label__pl	Mam oczy.
__label__pl	Gówno.
__label__pl	Znalazłem to!
__label__pl	Wstałem.
__label__pl	Nakarm mnie.
__label__pl	Jestem zły.
__label__pl	Tom poleciał.
__label__pl	Zatrzymaj ją!
__label__pl	Zatrzymać ją!
__label__pl	Bądź odważny
__label__pl	Jestem chory!
__label__pl	Kocham to.
__label__pl	Uwielbiam to.
__label__pl	Tom ukłonił się.
__label__pl	Spróbujmy!
__label__pl	Przymierz to.
__label__pl	Wziąłem to.
__label__pl	Wpuść mnie.
__label__pl	Obudziłem się.
__label__pl	Brakuje mi tego.
__label__pl	Tęsknię za tym.
__label__pl	Jestem gotowy!
__label__pl	Jest otwarte.
__label__pl	Zeskocz.
__label__pl	Skocz w dół.
__label__pl	To jest piasek.
__label__pl	To piasek.
__label__pl	Jest 9:15.
__label__pl	Jest dziewiąta piętnaście.
__label__pl	Jest smutna.
__label__pl	Jest dobry.
__label__pl	Usiądź przy mnie.
__label__pl	Telefon!
__label__pl	Zrobiłbym to.
__label__pl	Ja bym to zrobił.
__label__pl	Jest leniwy.
__label__pl	Jest leniem.
__label__pl	Jest obibokiem.
__label__pl	Jest ciemno.
__label__pl	Czy to już czas?
__label__pl	Włącz to.
__label__pl	Podoba nam się.
__label__pl	Lubimy to.
__label__pl	Mogę iść.
__label__pl	Puść Toma.
__label__pl	Jest nam zimno.
__label__pl	Nie było mnie.
__label__pl	Widzieliśmy cię.
__label__pl	Czy on jest wysoki?
__label__pl	Nie mówi po angielsku.
__label__pl	To dużo!
__label__pl	Nie jem sera.
__label__pl	Straciliśmy to.
__label__pl	Czy Tom wyszedł?
__label__pl	Pomódlmy się.
__label__pl	To jest zielone.
__label__pl	Jestem nieobiektywny.
__label__pl	Nie jest ze mną w porządku.
__label__pl	Przyjdź do nas.
__label__pl	Chodź do nas.
__label__pl	Kochamy to.
__label__pl	Pospieszę się.
__label__pl	To Toma.
__label__pl	To należy do Toma.
__label__pl	Patrz na nas.
__label__pl	Potrzebuję lodu.
__label__pl	Oh! Naprawdę?
__label__pl	Ukrywam się.
__label__pl	Jestem chciwy.
__label__pl	Tom jest wolny.
__label__pl	Jestem odporny.
__label__pl	Mam immunitet.
__label__pl	Mam odporność.
__label__pl	Wciągnij mnie.
__label__pl	Lubię Toma.
__label__pl	Czy Tom jest duży?
__label__pl	Tom to widział.
__label__pl	Jadłem.
__label__pl	Chcemy to.
__label__pl	Jestem skromny.
__label__pl	On nie żyje.
__label__pl	On jest martwy.
__label__pl	Żuję gumę.
__label__pl	Kupujemy płyty CD.
__label__pl	Wypiłem to.
__label__pl	Śmialiśmy się.
__label__pl	Mam jedną.
__label__pl	Tomek się ogolił.
__label__pl	Tom mnie zobaczył.
__label__pl	Tom mnie widział.
__label__pl	Nie przestawaj.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy bogaci.
__label__pl	Idź do pracy.
__label__pl	Tom będzie płakał.
__label__pl	Tom będzie ryczeć.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy z powrotem.
__label__pl	Jestem w środku.
__label__pl	Jestem wewnątrz.
__label__pl	Znam cię.
__label__pl	Widzieliśmy Toma.
__label__pl	Zazdroszczę jej.
__label__pl	Zazdroszczę im.
__label__pl	Przyznaję się.
__label__pl	Dobrze się bawiliśmy.
__label__pl	Bądź cierpliwy!
__label__pl	Wpuść Toma.
__label__pl	On to zrobił.
__label__pl	Odeszli.
__label__pl	Zobaczyli Toma.
__label__pl	Widzieli Toma.
__label__pl	Nienawidzę ich.
__label__pl	Tom przegra.
__label__pl	Nie jestem kłamcą.
__label__pl	Nie jestem kłamczynią.
__label__pl	Czułem się głupio.
__label__pl	Chcę mój.
__label__pl	Chcę moje.
__label__pl	To zasada.
__label__pl	Zrobiłeś to.
__label__pl	Dużo jem.
__label__pl	Myślę, że jest okej.
__label__pl	Udanej podróży.
__label__pl	Nigdy nie prosiłem o pomoc.
__label__pl	Nigdy nie prosiłam o pomoc.
__label__pl	Nic mnie to nie obchodzi.
__label__pl	Ja też was kocham.
__label__pl	Mój wujek dał mi prezent.
__label__pl	Wystarczająco szybko.
__label__pl	Idziemy.
__label__pl	Tom jest normalnym nastolatkiem.
__label__pl	Tom jest zwykłym nastolatkiem.
__label__pl	Ona może jutro przyjść.
__label__pl	Być może przyjdzie jutro.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary byli brudni.
__label__pl	Jestem sanitariuszem.
__label__pl	Jestem ratownikiem medycznym.
__label__pl	Tom nie pozwoli mi odejść.
__label__pl	Tom nie chce mnie puścić.
__label__pl	Paliłem, gdy byłem młody.
__label__pl	Paliłem w młodości.
__label__pl	Paliłem za młodu.
__label__pl	Dzieci się boją.
__label__pl	Nie sądzę, że Tom chciałby robić to samemu.
__label__pl	Nasza szkoła jest blisko stacji.
__label__pl	Moi rodzice byli nauczycielami..
__label__pl	Tom interesuje się astrologią.
__label__pl	Tom wiedział, że byłem głodny.
__label__pl	Jestem nauczycielem w gimnazjum.
__label__pl	Kobieta pracowała w domu.
__label__pl	Zostawiłem włączone radio.
__label__pl	Twoje włosy pachną wiosną.
__label__pl	Dlaczego jesteś na mnie zły?
__label__pl	Ile musimy zapłacić?
__label__pl	Tom obudził się następnego ranka i poszedł do szkoły.
__label__pl	on studiuje?
__label__pl	Tom poprosił Mary o papierosa.
__label__pl	Jesteś dobrym kotem.
__label__pl	Tom mówi, że nie czuje się dobrze dzisiaj.
__label__pl	Nie chcesz żeby Tom wygrał, prawda?
__label__pl	Mój dom jest tam.
__label__pl	„Nie jestem politykiem” - powiedział polityk.
__label__pl	Nikt nie lubi tego robić.
__label__pl	Szukam miejsca do siedzenia.
__label__pl	Ledwo go pamiętam.
__label__pl	Przychodzi o dwudziestej pierwszej.
__label__pl	Przyszedł przed odpoczynkiem.
__label__pl	Kiedy wszedłem do pokoju, Tom leżał na podłodze i jego oczy były zamknięte.
__label__pl	Ta bomba może zabić dużo ludzi.
__label__pl	Mary jest świadoma tego, prawda?
__label__pl	Nie byłaby szczęśliwa z nim.
__label__pl	Tom jest jedyny w swoim rodzaju.
__label__pl	Ludzie na nas patrzą.
__label__pl	Mam nadzieję, że Tom nie jest spłukany.
__label__pl	Mary mi powiedziała, że ma trzydziestkę.
__label__pl	Przyjdą po nas.
__label__pl	Nie ma wielu gości w restauracji.
__label__pl	Nie rozumiem Twojego sprzeciwu.
__label__pl	Mógłbym to zrobić jeszcze raz?
__label__pl	Zaznacz właściwą odpowiedź.
__label__pl	Ona wie, że zdradzała.
__label__pl	Tom był w tym samym pociągu co ja.
__label__pl	To musi być ostrzeżenie.
__label__pl	Tom nie wiedział co powiedzieć.
__label__pl	Powinieneś codziennie jeść śniadanie.
__label__pl	Powinienaś codziennie jeść śniadanie.
__label__pl	To jest uzależniająca gra.
__label__pl	Nie mają serca?
__label__pl	Zapytał o coś nauczyciela.
__label__pl	Nie wiadomo kto to zrobił.
__label__pl	Odegrał Hamleta na scenie.
__label__pl	Usadowił się
__label__pl	Francuski jest Twoim językiem ojczystym?
__label__pl	Nie możesz tego dalej robić.
__label__pl	Chcę siedzieć z przodu.
__label__pl	Tom musiał być wyczerpany.
__label__pl	Chcę dać znać Tomowi, żeby się nie martwił.
__label__pl	Nie mów do niej w taki sposób.
__label__pl	Zerwał ze swoją dziewczyną.
__label__pl	Uwielbiam mówić do mojego kota po francusku.
__label__pl	Wiem jak prowadzić ciężarówkę.
__label__pl	Nie chcę się o tym już więcej martwić.
__label__pl	Boże, przebacz mi za moje grzechy.
__label__pl	Jak to?
__label__pl	Tom nie mógł mówić.
__label__pl	Jesteś profesorem.
__label__pl	Tom jest profesorem.
__label__pl	Czekam na jego telefon.
__label__pl	To jest mniej więcej wielkości jajka.
__label__pl	Od czasu do czasu.
__label__pl	Świat jest teraz zupełnie inny.
__label__pl	Bądź cicho podczas kursu.
__label__pl	Bądź cicho w trakcie lekcji.
__label__pl	Lubię was.
__label__pl	Odejdź!
__label__pl	Mam dwóch kuzynów.
__label__pl	Mam dwie kuzynki.
__label__pl	Uczysz się?
__label__pl	On je.
__label__pl	Muszę już wyjść.
__label__pl	Jesteś sama?
__label__pl	Dokąd się wybierasz?
__label__pl	Gdzie się wybierasz?
__label__pl	Gdzie chciałbyś pójść?
__label__pl	Co robisz jutro?
__label__pl	Co będziesz robił jutro?
__label__pl	Proszę, pomóż mi.
__label__pl	Proszę, pomóżcie mi.
__label__pl	Nie przejmuj się tym!
__label__pl	To wasze?
__label__pl	To pańskie?
__label__pl	To twój samochód?
__label__pl	To jest pańskie.
__label__pl	To jest jej.
__label__pl	To jest ich.
__label__pl	Nie jem mięsa tak często jak kiedyś.
__label__pl	Lubisz herbatę?
__label__pl	Jem szybko.
__label__pl	Skończył nam się czas.
__label__pl	Nie mamy już czasu.
__label__pl	Powinnaś jeść.
__label__pl	Jem makaron.
__label__pl	Lubisz sok?
__label__pl	Jesteście nowi?
__label__pl	Prawie nigdy go nie widuję.
__label__pl	Udanego lotu!
__label__pl	To nie jest ważne.
__label__pl	Kocham twój samochód.
__label__pl	Szłam sama.
__label__pl	Tom może przyjść.
__label__pl	Lubisz jeść ryby?
__label__pl	Lubi Pan jeść ryby?
__label__pl	Kochałem was.
__label__pl	Wygląda na to, że jest chory.
__label__pl	Może nie miałem racji.
__label__pl	Zrób to od razu.
__label__pl	Przytrzymaj dla mnie Toma.
__label__pl	Czy to wszystko jest konieczne?
__label__pl	Gdzie moja mama?
__label__pl	Gdzie jest mama?
__label__pl	Gdzie mama?
__label__pl	Przyszedłem z powodu Toma.
__label__pl	Jestem tu z powodu Toma.
__label__pl	Tom chce zabić Mary.
__label__pl	Zabijemy cię.
__label__pl	Nie możesz mnie zabić.
__label__pl	Czy Tom wierzy w magię?
__label__pl	Jesteś córką Toma?
__label__pl	Geralt jest wiedźminem.
__label__pl	Geralt to wiedźmin.
__label__pl	Elfy mają szpiczaste uszy.
__label__pl	Elfy mają spiczaste uszy.
__label__pl	Naprawdę jesteś księżniczką?
__label__pl	Tom nie jest magikiem.
__label__pl	Europa jest kontynentem.
__label__pl	Europa to kontynent.
__label__pl	Byłem gruby.
__label__pl	Byłam gruba.
__label__pl	Mary jest elfem.
__label__pl	Masz córkę?
__label__pl	Kocham moją córkę.
__label__pl	Zajmij się swoimi sprawami.
__label__pl	Zna mnie pan?
__label__pl	Dzisiaj jest gorąco.
__label__pl	Dziś jest gorąco.
__label__pl	Wyglądasz na zajętego.
__label__pl	To nie była moja wina.
__label__pl	Możesz to zrobić jeszcze raz?
__label__pl	Dlaczego jeszcze tu jesteś?
__label__pl	Rozczarowałeś mnie.
__label__pl	Zdejmij buty.
__label__pl	Dziękuję za przybycie.
__label__pl	Jesteś idiotką!
__label__pl	Jesteś ślepy?
__label__pl	Jesteś niewidomy?
__label__pl	Bądź sobą.
__label__pl	Czy chcesz jeszcze jeden taki?
__label__pl	Czy chcesz jeszcze jeden z nich?
__label__pl	Czy chcesz jeszcze jednego z nich?
__label__pl	Grasz w piłkę nożną?
__label__pl	Jesteś singlem?
__label__pl	Jesteś kawalerem?
__label__pl	Powiedz prawdę.
__label__pl	Lubię obu.
__label__pl	Gdzie są wasze dokumenty?
__label__pl	Gdzie są twoje papiery?
__label__pl	Gdzie są wasze papiery?
__label__pl	Tom do mnie zadzwonił.
__label__pl	Kto to powiedział Tomowi?
__label__pl	Tom może to zrobić ponownie.
__label__pl	Potrzebujemy więcej jedzenia.
__label__pl	Postradałeś rozum.
__label__pl	Postradałeś zmysły.
__label__pl	Masz nie po kolei w głowie.
__label__pl	Masz mecz?
__label__pl	Jesteś tam?
__label__pl	Gdzie jest wola, tam jest i sposób.
__label__pl	Nie walcz.
__label__pl	Gdzie Tom się ukrywa?
__label__pl	Gdzie to jest ukryte?
__label__pl	To od twojej rodziny.
__label__pl	Tom zostaje z nami.
__label__pl	Jestem w kuchni.
__label__pl	Tom zrezygnował z kandydowania na przewodniczącego klasy.
__label__pl	Kiedy dokładnie chcesz to zrobić?
__label__pl	To byłoby dobre.
__label__pl	Jak się miewa Twoja matka?
__label__pl	Opatrzność doprowadziła mnie do niej.
__label__pl	Na szczęście opatrzność boska była po mojej stronie.
__label__pl	Zbliża się egzamin.
__label__pl	Zjedz zupę zanim wystygnie.
__label__pl	Moja starsza siostra codziennie uprawia jogging.
__label__pl	Moja starsza siostra codziennie biega.
__label__pl	Tom jest rycerzem.
__label__pl	Płomień zgasł.
__label__pl	Jego Królewska Mość czeka.
__label__pl	Musisz chronić swoją rodzinę.
__label__pl	Musisz ochronić swoją rodzinę.
__label__pl	Tom powinien był chronić Mary.
__label__pl	Będę cię chronił.
__label__pl	Nie jestem czarownicą.
__label__pl	Nie mam twojej odwagi.
__label__pl	Czasami za dużo myślisz.
__label__pl	Obaj są martwi.
__label__pl	Obie są martwe.
__label__pl	Jest zupełnie nowy.
__label__pl	Jest zupełnie nowa.
__label__pl	Jest zupełnie nowe.
__label__pl	Możesz tam iść.
__label__pl	Chciałbyś przyjść?
__label__pl	Chciałabyś przyjść?
__label__pl	Cieszę się, że znów cię widzę.
__label__pl	Miło mi znowu cię widzieć.
__label__pl	Masz kuku na muniu.
__label__pl	Brakuje ci piątej klepki.
__label__pl	Tom widział łosia.
__label__pl	On widział łosia.
__label__pl	Czy to jest łoś?
__label__pl	Widziałem dzisiaj łosia.
__label__pl	Łosie są żartobliwie nazywane "bagiennymi osłami".
__label__pl	Czy łoś jest największym jeleniowatym na świecie?
__label__pl	Łoś polizał Toma po twarzy, gdy ten spał.
__label__pl	Drzewa zapewniają cień.
__label__pl	Przechowywać w cieniu.
__label__pl	Ta roślina potrzebuje cienia.
__label__pl	Lud przemówił.
__label__pl	Naród przemówił.
__label__pl	Jest cholernie gorąco.
__label__pl	Dla mnie słowo Bóg jest synonimem Transcendentalnej Inteligencji.
__label__pl	Kiedy weźmiesz kąpiel?
__label__pl	Kiedy się wykąpiesz?
__label__pl	Zrobiłem to, co trzeba było zrobić.
__label__pl	To co zrobił Tom było szalone.
__label__pl	Zrobiłem to, co należało zrobić.
__label__pl	Tom złowił płoć.
__label__pl	Do zobaczenia na zajęciach z francuskiego.
__label__pl	Skontaktowałem się z Tomem.
__label__pl	Dlaczego mnie o to zapytała?
__label__pl	Najpierw nad tym popracujemy.
__label__pl	Pomógłbyś mi?
__label__pl	Czemu kłamiesz?
__label__pl	Gdzie są twoje rzeczy?
__label__pl	Cieszę się, że was widzę.
__label__pl	Kiedy możesz przyjść?
__label__pl	Gdzie jest książka?
__label__pl	Konie to zwierzęta.
__label__pl	Tom nie może ci pomóc.
__label__pl	Nienawidzę tego miejsca.
__label__pl	Nie możesz jeszcze iść do domu.
__label__pl	Zbliża się wrogi statek.
__label__pl	Tom skończył już to robić.
__label__pl	Pomogłem Tomowi wspiąć się po ścianie.
__label__pl	Jesteś pewien, że nie chcesz nic do jedzenia?
__label__pl	Jesteś pewna, że nie chcesz nic do jedzenia?
__label__pl	Tom postanowił, że spróbuje to zrobić.
__label__pl	Nie wiedziałem, że Tom nie zamierzał tego zrobić.
__label__pl	Nie wiedziałem, że Tom nie planował tego zrobić.
__label__pl	Tom położył dzieci do łóżka.
__label__pl	Potrzebuję tego dzisiaj.
__label__pl	Wszyscy patrzą.
__label__pl	Cały świat patrzy.
__label__pl	Czułam się, jakbym nie miała wyboru.
__label__pl	Chce mi się pić.
__label__pl	Nie wiem tego.
__label__pl	Bardzo się bałem.
__label__pl	Nie możemy pomóc Tomowi.
__label__pl	Nie obchodzi mnie to, ale Toma tak.
__label__pl	Śmierć jest przeznaczeniem każdego człowieka.
__label__pl	Gdzie jest jej królewska mość?
__label__pl	Gdzie są moje smoki?
__label__pl	Chodźmy razem zjeść.
__label__pl	Równie dobrze możemy poczekać.
__label__pl	Tom jeździ białym samochodem.
__label__pl	Wiemy, co robisz.
__label__pl	Robisz to dobrze.
__label__pl	Nie jestem pewien, co masz na myśli.
__label__pl	To nie w Wietnamie nauczyłem się wietnamskiego.
__label__pl	Lubię ten rodzaj pracy.
__label__pl	Lubię tego typu pracę.
__label__pl	Lubię sztukę.
__label__pl	Kocham sztukę.
__label__pl	Nie mam pojęcia o sztuce.
__label__pl	Nie znam się na sztuce.
__label__pl	Jaki rodzaj pracy wykonujesz?
__label__pl	Zawsze słucham tej piosenki.
__label__pl	Czas iść do łóżka.
__label__pl	Czas iść spać.
__label__pl	Proszę pozostać na miejscu.
__label__pl	Chciałbym to zobaczyć.
__label__pl	Nie jesteś głodny?
__label__pl	Podążaj za tym samochodem.
__label__pl	Nadal cię kocham.
__label__pl	Wciąż cię kocham.
__label__pl	Jedz co chcesz.
__label__pl	Jedz, na co masz ochotę.
__label__pl	Daj mi proszę szklankę wody.
__label__pl	Zostańcie z nami.
__label__pl	Proszę, przyjdź tutaj.
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie rozumiesz?
__label__pl	Ona jest czarodziejką.
__label__pl	Zdenerwowali się.
__label__pl	Spal to!
__label__pl	Wszyscy chcieli wiedzieć.
__label__pl	Czy film ma napisy?
__label__pl	Nie rozumiem niczego bez napisów.
__label__pl	Nie zrozumiem niczego bez napisów.
__label__pl	To ma dla nas znaczenie.
__label__pl	Byłem zdruzgotany.
__label__pl	Byłem załamany.
__label__pl	Zniszcz tę świątynię.
__label__pl	Jak się mają wasze dzieci?
__label__pl	Znam waszego ojca.
__label__pl	Nie lubię waszego psa.
__label__pl	Nie lubię twojego psa.
__label__pl	Jak się miewa wasza matka?
__label__pl	Wiemy, co robicie.
__label__pl	Jesteś bardzo chora.
__label__pl	Jesteś dużo niższa od Toma, prawda?
__label__pl	Myślałam, że Tom więcej tego nie zrobi.
__label__pl	Przyszłam kilka minut za wcześnie.
__label__pl	Jestem kilka minut wcześniej.
__label__pl	Nie chcę, żebyś pomyślała, że jestem niezadowolona z twojej decyzji.
__label__pl	Zaprosiłam Toma na obiad.
__label__pl	Powiedziałaś Tomowi, skąd jesteś?
__label__pl	Mamy mniej niż pięć minut na ewakuację całego budynku.
__label__pl	Dlaczego ona go nie szuka?
__label__pl	Myślałam, że nie żyjesz.
__label__pl	Grubo wyglądasz.
__label__pl	Jak się ma twoja rodzina?
__label__pl	Oni są nauczycielami.
__label__pl	Zepsułeś to?
__label__pl	Ci, którzy mieszkają w szklanych domach, nie powinni rzucać kamieniami.
__label__pl	Nie odezwał się ani słowem.
__label__pl	Dlaczego się tak spieszysz?
__label__pl	Chcę znowu z tobą porozmawiać.
__label__pl	Nie chcę się wtrącać w twoje prywatne życie.
__label__pl	To jest możliwe.
__label__pl	Tom został rozebrany do pasa.
__label__pl	Tom był rozebrany do pasa.
__label__pl	Nasz dom jest pusty.
__label__pl	Czy masz podwójne łóżko?
__label__pl	Pij dużo płynów.
__label__pl	Dałem im trochę jabłek.
__label__pl	Tom jest większy od ciebie.
__label__pl	Tom działał w samoobronie.
__label__pl	Mary mieszka w centrum miasta.
__label__pl	Zrobił to z nią.
__label__pl	Miałeś z tym coś wspólnego?
__label__pl	Miałbyś coś przeciwko, gdybym wszedł?
__label__pl	Zabierzcie ze sobą dzieci.
__label__pl	Chciałbym, aby każdy dzień był Bożym Narodzeniem.
__label__pl	Chciałabym, aby każdy dzień był Bożym Narodzeniem.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że nigdy nie pozwoli Mary prowadzić.
__label__pl	Myślałem, że powiedziałeś mi, że nie znasz Toma.
__label__pl	Myślałem, że powiedziałaś mi, że nie znasz Toma.
__label__pl	Pracowałem z nim.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy gotowi do drogi?
__label__pl	Tom nigdy nie użył pralki.
__label__pl	Mary jest zaproszona, prawda?
__label__pl	Tom miał nadzieję Cię zobaczyć.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że Mary nie była teraz w Australii.
__label__pl	Tom nie myślał, że Mary była spłukana.
__label__pl	Posiadam trzy koty.
__label__pl	Czego potrzebujecie?
__label__pl	Wspomnę mu to.
__label__pl	Muszę kupić nowy rower.
__label__pl	Nie oszukuj się.
__label__pl	Wiedziałem, kim on był.
__label__pl	Jak to było?
__label__pl	Co ja właśnie powiedziałem?
__label__pl	Co mówiłem?
__label__pl	Co mówiłam?
__label__pl	Czy naprawdę było warto?
__label__pl	Mówi pan szybko.
__label__pl	Mówicie szybko.
__label__pl	Mówisz szybko.
__label__pl	Nie rozumiem was.
__label__pl	Uwielbiam być sama.
__label__pl	Uwielbiam być sam.
__label__pl	Kocham być sama.
__label__pl	Kocham być sam.
__label__pl	Jak pomogłeś Tomowi?
__label__pl	Jak pomogłaś Tomowi?
__label__pl	Jak pomogliście Tomowi?
__label__pl	Kto co widział?
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie pójdziesz zobaczyć się z Tomem?
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie pójdziesz i nie porozmawiasz z Tomem?
__label__pl	Czy kazałem wam długo czekać?
__label__pl	Czy kazałem ci długo czekać?
__label__pl	Jedzenie jest zimne.
__label__pl	Kocham poniedziałek!
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że chce mu się pić.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że jest spragniony.
__label__pl	Nie wiemy, co to jest.
__label__pl	Tom je jabłko.
__label__pl	Nie chcę tego słyszeć.
__label__pl	Tom posiada samochód.
__label__pl	To dla mnie nowość.
__label__pl	Będziemy szczęśliwi.
__label__pl	Nie chcę waszych pieniędzy.

__label__pl	Dziś jest bardzo gorąco, czyż nie?
__label__pl	Jest bardzo gorąco, czyż nie?
__label__pl	Czy mogę wam pomóc?
__label__pl	Jestem po trzydziestce.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy tutaj.
__label__pl	Mógłbyś zapytać Toma.
__label__pl	To muszę być ja.
__label__pl	Jestem w tobie naprawdę zakochany.
__label__pl	Obojętnie kto.
__label__pl	Nie byłem w domu.
__label__pl	Nie było mnie w domu.
__label__pl	Myślę, że mamy wystarczająco.

__label__pl	Mamy nowy problem.
__label__pl	Co powinienem powiedzieć?
__label__pl	To był pański pomysł.
__label__pl	Nie mogę sobie przypomnieć, kto pojawił się pierwszy.

__label__pl	Potrzebujesz samochodu.
__label__pl	Potrzebuje pan samochodu.
__label__pl	Ok, słuchaj.
__label__pl	Pozwolisz Tomowi odejść?
__label__pl	Tom nie zabija zwierząt.
__label__pl	To miasto jest przeklęte.
__label__pl	Bard grał na lutni.
__label__pl	Nie lubię chodzić do dentysty.
__label__pl	Miał dość jedzenia cukierków.
__label__pl	Odkryłem, że mnie obgadujesz.
__label__pl	Zarówno Tom jak i Marry studiują francuski.
__label__pl	Zastanawiam się, czy Tom ma łaskotki.

__label__pl	Przyszedł po twoim wyjściu.
__label__pl	Powinieneś to zrobić natychmiast.
__label__pl	Wyślij mi to, gdy będziesz miał czas.
__label__pl	To nie ja zacząłem walkę.
__label__pl	To nie ja zacząłem bójkę.
__label__pl	Tom nie chce chodzić do przedszkola.
__label__pl	Jak możemy się chronić?
__label__pl	Ulubioną porą roku Toma jest wiosna.
__label__pl	Ona jest cichą osobą.
__label__pl	Kocham was.
__label__pl	Dlaczego tak na mnie patrzysz?
__label__pl	Chcesz iść na polowanie?
__label__pl	Za dużo pijesz, Tom.
__label__pl	Ten drink jest na koszt firmy.
__label__pl	Ten jest na koszt firmy.
__label__pl	Tom kogoś widział.
__label__pl	Przyjdź wkrótce.
__label__pl	Tom zostawił w metrze swoją teczkę.
__label__pl	Dlaczego to jest dobra rzecz?
__label__pl	Jak się miewa pański brat?
__label__pl	Wszędzie była krew.
__label__pl	Możecie na mnie liczyć.
__label__pl	Myślę, że to ma sens.
__label__pl	To musi być znak.
__label__pl	Dlaczego jesteś taki cichy?
__label__pl	Zamknij te cholerne drzwi!
__label__pl	Lasy są moim domem.
__label__pl	Lasy zielenią się na wiosnę.
__label__pl	Powiedziałem, padnij!
__label__pl	Powiedziałem, zejdź!
__label__pl	Myślę, że potrzebujesz więcej odpoczynku.
__label__pl	Odjechali.
__label__pl	Twoje nazwisko brzmi znajomo.

__label__pl	Tom potarł swój podbródek.
__label__pl	Uderzyłem go w brodę.
__label__pl	Uderzyłam go w brodę.
__label__pl	Mieszaj dalej.
__label__pl	Mieszaj zupę.
__label__pl	Tom nie mieszał.

__label__pl	Wdepnąłem w błoto.
__label__pl	Wdepnęłam w błoto.
__label__pl	Co robił telefon Dana w błocie?
__label__pl	Nie zauważyłem błota na moich butach.
__label__pl	Zacząłem ten wątek.

__label__pl	Tom ma brzuch piwny.
__label__pl	Chcesz powiedzieć, że celowo ukrywasz swoją urodę?
__label__pl	Ludzie nigdy nie mieli żyć wiecznie.
__label__pl	Mojego nauczyciela fizyki nie obchodzi, czy opuszczam lekcje.
__label__pl	Nie można oczekiwać wszystkiego od szkół.
__label__pl	Naprawdę nie masz właściwych priorytetów.
__label__pl	Wyobraźnia wpływa na każdy aspekt naszych żyć.
__label__pl	Dziesięć lat to długi czas oczekiwania.
__label__pl	Połóż talię kart na dębowym stole.
__label__pl	Musimy nauczyć się żyć razem jak bracia, albo zginiemy razem jak głupcy.
__label__pl	Tym, co zmienia świat jest komunikacja, nie informacja.
__label__pl	Nie będziemy wiedzieć.
__label__pl	Przejdź się.
__label__pl	Pił.
__label__pl	Piła.
__label__pl	Tomasz mówi, że to nie jest prawdą.
__label__pl	Nikt nie rodzi się bez wad.
__label__pl	Dziewczyna wszędzie podążała za swoją matką.
__label__pl	Proszę, spuść z tonu.
__label__pl	Musimy odwołać naszą wycieczkę do Japonii.
__label__pl	Ej, uspokój się.
__label__pl	To jest grzebień.
__label__pl	Twój grzebień jest piękny.
__label__pl	Twój grzebień jest uroczy.
__label__pl	Policja przeczesała miasto.
__label__pl	To plastikowy grzebień.
__label__pl	Uważaj, to niebezpieczne skrzyżowanie!
__label__pl	Makowiec, który zostawiłam w lodówce, jest już napoczęty.
__label__pl	Od znajomego kupiłam ul.
__label__pl	Zrobiłem, co mogłem, żeby ci pomóc.
__label__pl	Tom obiecał nigdy więcej się nie spóźniać.
__label__pl	Studia to marnacja czasu.
__label__pl	Myślałem, że powiedziałeś, że Tom jest twoim bratem.
__label__pl	Masz gdzie zostać?
__label__pl	Społeczeństwo jest złożone.
__label__pl	Przedyskutują to.
__label__pl	Nawet nie mogę pić wody.
__label__pl	To był ulubiony krawat mojego ojca.
__label__pl	Czy oni są przyjaciółmi?
__label__pl	Tom wydaje się taki samotny.
__label__pl	Nie poddawaj się bez walki.
__label__pl	Nie poddawaj się w walce.
__label__pl	Wynoś się, i to natychmiast.

__label__pl	Zastanawiam się, czy Tom uczył się Francuskiego.
__label__pl	Nie sądzę, żeby ktokolwiek mógł powstrzymać Toma.
__label__pl	Tom postawił kubki na półce.
__label__pl	Lekarze myśleli, że to śmieszne.
__label__pl	Tom kocha plotkować.
__label__pl	Lubię słuchać muzyki.
__label__pl	Wcześnie przychodzisz.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział Mary, czyż nie?
__label__pl	Mogę porozmawiać z lekarzem?
__label__pl	Niczego nie ryzykuję.
__label__pl	Chcę wiedzieć, dlaczego zrobiłeś to, co zrobiłeś.
__label__pl	Chcę wiedzieć, dlaczego zrobiłaś to, co zrobiłaś.
__label__pl	Żółwie długo żyją.
__label__pl	Jest teraz zbyt ciemno, żeby grać w baseball.
__label__pl	Wszystkie moje problemy się skończyły.
__label__pl	Czy wstają wcześnie rano?
__label__pl	Nie jestem katolikiem.
__label__pl	Nie jestem katoliczką.
__label__pl	Cenzura to okropny zwyczaj.
__label__pl	Czy naprawdę myślisz, że sam możesz wypić całą tę butelkę wina?
__label__pl	Wygrała konkurs.
__label__pl	Wiedzą, co się dzieje.
__label__pl	Możesz tutaj spędzać tyle czasu, ile chcesz.
__label__pl	Byliśmy jak bracia.

__label__pl	Co więcej dostanę?
__label__pl	Co więcej otrzymam?
__label__pl	Jakim uczniem jesteś?
__label__pl	Tom nie miał pojęcia, jak zmęczona była Mary.
__label__pl	Maszyna do lodów jest zepsuta.
__label__pl	Jest trochę pijana.
__label__pl	Przeszliśmy się wokół ogrodu.
__label__pl	Czy kiedyś Stany Zjednoczone i Kanada się zjednoczą?
__label__pl	Czasem jedno słowo starczy.
__label__pl	Tom lubi, jak Mary śpiewa.
__label__pl	Nie wciągaj mnie w to.
__label__pl	Tom jest skromny.
__label__pl	Jest skromny.
__label__pl	Jesteś zbyt skromny.
__label__pl	Jesteś zbyt skromna.

__label__pl	Zamachnęłam się na niego.
__label__pl	Byli dziwni.
__label__pl	Były dziwne.
__label__pl	Policja nie ma dowodów przeciwko Tomowi.
__label__pl	Ma mój głos.
__label__pl	Założyła swoje rękawiczki.
__label__pl	Twoje odciski palców były na pistolecie.
__label__pl	Ten nóż był dla mnie bardzo przydatny.
__label__pl	Mam telefony z klawiaturami.
__label__pl	Doktor Faust był bardzo obeznany z alchemią.
__label__pl	Nie spiesz się.
__label__pl	Jest poniedziałek.
__label__pl	Nie jem mięsa.
__label__pl	Gdybym mógł wysłać ci piankę, Trang, zrobiłbym to.
__label__pl	Czytamy.
__label__pl	Właśnie czytamy.
__label__pl	Nigdy nie piję sam.
__label__pl	Czuję się zmęczony.
__label__pl	Nic ci nie będzie.
__label__pl	Czułem się pominięty.
__label__pl	Tutaj się urodziłem.
__label__pl	Byłam świadkiem.
__label__pl	Król został stracony.
__label__pl	Mam silny ból zęba.
__label__pl	Ona go dźgnęła.

__label__pl	Weź lekarstwo.
__label__pl	Czytam gazetę.
__label__pl	Właśnie czytam gazetę.
__label__pl	Toma nie ma w domu.
__label__pl	Tom spadł z roweru.
__label__pl	Zabierz to.
__label__pl	Nie każ mi tego robić.
__label__pl	Nie zmuszaj mnie do tego.
__label__pl	Są braćmi.
__label__pl	To bracia.
__label__pl	Wolę czerń.
__label__pl	Wolę czarny.
__label__pl	Nadal jesteśmy bardzo zajęci.
__label__pl	Nadal mamy wiele do zrobienia.
__label__pl	Czyj to numer telefonu?
__label__pl	Ona je chleb.
__label__pl	To nielogiczne.
__label__pl	To nie jest logiczne.
__label__pl	Tom jadł jak świnia.
__label__pl	Tom żarł jak świnia.
__label__pl	Mam kilka srebrnych monet.
__label__pl	Posiadam kilka srebrnych monet.

__label__pl	Tom jest dziwakiem.
__label__pl	Gdzie jest moja książka telefoniczna?
__label__pl	Kochałem ten dom.
__label__pl	Musisz to zobaczyć.
__label__pl	Musicie to zobaczyć.
__label__pl	Czy to prawdziwa krew?
__label__pl	Umiesz czytać?
__label__pl	Jest trochę chwiejny.
__label__pl	Tom nie jest zajęty.
__label__pl	Kazałem mu umyć samochód.
__label__pl	Słownik definiuje słowa.
__label__pl	Tomowi udało się uciec.
__label__pl	Dziewczyny płakały.
__label__pl	Obiecuję cię nie zawieść.
__label__pl	Ranisz nas.
__label__pl	Kto jest ojcem Toma?
__label__pl	To curry jest za ostre.
__label__pl	Chcę odzyskać moje kosztowności.
__label__pl	Tom nam powie.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy geniuszami.
__label__pl	Nie powiedzieli tego.
__label__pl	Nie mam dokąd pójść.
__label__pl	Zwolnili cię?
__label__pl	Mam to.
__label__pl	Właśnie widziałem ogromną sowę.
__label__pl	Fantastycznie!
__label__pl	To jest za drogie!
__label__pl	Nie mogę spać.
__label__pl	Jem tutaj.
__label__pl	Wróciłam.
__label__pl	Myj się!
__label__pl	Nie żal mi go.
__label__pl	Tom zapadł w głęboki sen.
__label__pl	To nie może czekać do jutra.
__label__pl	Wiemy, że jesteście wegetarianami.
__label__pl	Razem się upili.
__label__pl	Kto mu dał mój adres?
__label__pl	Ludzie często narzekają na wysokie ceny.
__label__pl	Tom nie wie, co zrobi.
__label__pl	Tom nie powiedział mi niczego o tym.
__label__pl	Jest dokładnie taka, jak jej ojciec.
__label__pl	Tom skończył na drugim miejscu.
__label__pl	Tom właśnie został zwolniony.
__label__pl	Zapłać proszę!
__label__pl	Muszę to znaleźć.
__label__pl	Moja siostra pokazała mi swój nowy zegarek.
__label__pl	Chcę jechać.
__label__pl	Jestem tego świadomy.
__label__pl	Zdaję sobie z tego sprawę.
__label__pl	Lepszy.
__label__pl	Lepsza.
__label__pl	Lepiej.
__label__pl	On jest moim bratem.
__label__pl	Gdzie jest bank?
__label__pl	Żaden problem.
__label__pl	Myślałem, że już o tym rozmawialiśmy.

__label__pl	Nie lubię jakoś bardzo kotów.
__label__pl	Nie potrzebujemy Cię tutaj.
__label__pl	Mary nie potrafi sama zawiązać swoich sznurówek.
__label__pl	Śpiewasz w wannie?
__label__pl	Chcę dobrego życia dla mojej rodziny.
__label__pl	Myślałem, że powiedziałeś, że potrzebujesz mnie by to zrobić dla Ciebie.
__label__pl	Myślałem, że powiedziałaś, że potrzebujesz mnie by to zrobić dla Ciebie.
__label__pl	Powiedział, że nie potrafił wygrać.
__label__pl	Mary podrzuciła swojego syna do szkoły.
__label__pl	Tom nie potrzebował gotówki.
__label__pl	Do kogo należy ten samochód?
__label__pl	Tom nie znał Mary w zeszłym roku.
__label__pl	Ta piosenka jest świetna.
__label__pl	To mogłoby być bolesne.
__label__pl	Jesteś zbyt miły.
__label__pl	Jesteś zbyt miła.
__label__pl	Nie mogę podnieść Toma.
__label__pl	Czy Tom naprawdę powiedział, że to jest za darmo?
__label__pl	Grałem w pokera przez cały dzień.
__label__pl	Dzieci śpiewały.
__label__pl	Nigdy mi nie powiedziałeś, że Tom był krawcem.
__label__pl	Nigdy mi nie powiedziałaś, że Tom był krawcem.
__label__pl	Niektórzy Algierczycy są bardzo religijni.
__label__pl	Tom nie jest przyjacielem Mary.
__label__pl	To było w twojej szufladzie.
__label__pl	Tom wygląda na wstrząśniętego.
__label__pl	Chcę pocałować Toma.
__label__pl	Tom nie wie, co mówi.
__label__pl	Planuję polecieć w ten weekend na Marsa, jeśli uda mi się dostać bilety na statek kosmiczny.
__label__pl	Wiedziałem, że Tom nam skłamał.
__label__pl	Wiedziałam, że Tom nam skłamał.
__label__pl	Yanni pracuje.
__label__pl	To ładny samochód.
__label__pl	Czy jesteś pewien, że chcesz kontynuować?
__label__pl	Co robisz w moim pokoju?
__label__pl	Co robicie w moim pokoju?
__label__pl	Chciałem pomóc wam wszystkim.
__label__pl	Jest dumna z siebie.
__label__pl	Właśnie zadzwoniła.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary codziennie grają w tenis.
__label__pl	Mary jest wysoka jak na swój wiek.
__label__pl	Czy kupiłeś jajka?
__label__pl	Czy kupiłaś jaja?
__label__pl	Gdzie mieszkacie?
__label__pl	Zobaczyłem mężczyznę przebranego za ninja.
__label__pl	Tom nie sądzi, żeby Mary mogła go powstrzymać.
__label__pl	Obaj jesteście moimi przyjaciółmi.
__label__pl	Oboje jesteście moimi przyjaciółmi.
__label__pl	Tom nie oddał tego.
__label__pl	Zjadłem sam.
__label__pl	Kot nie przestaje miauczeć.
__label__pl	Wypijmy te wino.
__label__pl	Wypijmy te piwo.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary zostali zaproszeni do Bostonu.
__label__pl	Podejrzewam, że Tom i Mary po prostu szydzili.
__label__pl	Powinniśmy zrobić to, co zawsze robimy.
__label__pl	Powinnyśmy zrobić to, co zawsze robimy.
__label__pl	Roślinność jest zastępowana fabrykami i drogami.
__label__pl	Czy chciałbyś psa?
__label__pl	Czy chciałabyś psa?
__label__pl	Tom chciał spędzić Sylwestra z Mary.
__label__pl	Obserwuję dom.
__label__pl	Pilnuję domu.
__label__pl	Wcale nie źle!
__label__pl	Połóż to na moim biurku.
__label__pl	Tom podpali dom rywala z zazdrości.
__label__pl	Czy powinniśmy rozbroić policję?
__label__pl	Czy powinnyśmy rozbroić policję?
__label__pl	Nie mogę uwierzyć, że ci to pokazałem.
__label__pl	Nie mogę uwierzyć, że ci to pokazałam.
__label__pl	Tom nigdy nie zrobił tu tego.
__label__pl	Nie mogłem znaleźć Toma.
__label__pl	Jest najpiękniejszą z trzech sióstr.
__label__pl	Byłem zadowolony.
__label__pl	Nie mam z nim żadnego problemu.
__label__pl	Kiedy to od nas kupiłaś?
__label__pl	Już wiem, co Tom chce mi powiedzieć.
__label__pl	Jakie pamiątki kupiłaś?
__label__pl	Gdzie w hotelu jest recepcja?
__label__pl	Wyglądała, jakby wstrzymywała wielkiego pierda.
__label__pl	Są inne sposoby zrobienia tego.
__label__pl	Na którym uniwersytecie studiujesz?
__label__pl	Nie zrozumiałem, co mówił profesor.
__label__pl	Spróbuję dotrzeć do Toma.
__label__pl	Czy ktoś rozmawiał z Tomem?
__label__pl	Tom nie był zły.
__label__pl	Mam nadzieję zrobić to dziś.
__label__pl	Zgubiłem swoje wieczne pióro. Będę musiał kupić jutro nowe.
__label__pl	Nie potrafię grać na oboju.
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie wytłumaczyłaś tego Tomowi?
__label__pl	Umiem grać w szachy, ale nie umiem grać w warcaby.
__label__pl	Tom mówi, że nie jest gotowy, by to zrobić.
__label__pl	Przed jedzeniem?
__label__pl	Czyta beletrystykę.
__label__pl	Czyta fikcję.
__label__pl	Nie potrafię wytrzymać głośnej muzyki.
__label__pl	Dlaczego powinienem używać nici dentystycznej?
__label__pl	Tom przeraził Mary.
__label__pl	To nie jest prawdziwe mieszkanie.
__label__pl	Zapewniam cię, że nam zależy.
__label__pl	Mówi, że porozmawiał z nią.
__label__pl	Być może ty i Tom powinniście razem zaśpiewać.
__label__pl	Tom wygrał triatlon.
__label__pl	Obwiniałem ciebie i Toma.
__label__pl	Nigdy nie wierzył w Boga.
__label__pl	Tom przyszedł z prezentem.
__label__pl	Sami powiedział swojemu tacie.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary mogą zostać aresztowani, jeśli znowu to zrobią.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary robią tylko to, co chcą.
__label__pl	Sami otrzymał ostrzeżenie.
__label__pl	Sami zapłacił za swoje jedzenie.
__label__pl	Nie lubię być traktowany jak dziecko.
__label__pl	Nie znają zasad.
__label__pl	Marie dobrze mówi po francusku.
__label__pl	Nie wiem, co będę robił jutro.
__label__pl	Jest zbyt wielu ludzi w tym autobusie.
__label__pl	Jak zamierzasz świętować?
__label__pl	Jak zamierzacie świętować?
__label__pl	Co powiesz na poczekanie przez kolejne pięć minut?
__label__pl	Przeczytałbym tę powieść, gdyby była interesująca.
__label__pl	Tom zjadł ramen na obiad.
__label__pl	Mary kochała swoje dzieci.
__label__pl	Powiedziałeś mi, że mógłbyś to zrobić.
__label__pl	Jest pochmurno.
__label__pl	Dam radę.
__label__pl	Lepiej zamknij drzwi.
__label__pl	Ledwo znam Toma.
__label__pl	Ile ma pan dzieci?
__label__pl	Tom ma bardzo dobry gust muzyczny.
__label__pl	Musisz jej pomóc.
__label__pl	Teraz pańska kolej.
__label__pl	Teraz wasza kolej.
__label__pl	Każdy wierzy, że marzenia mogą się spełnić.
__label__pl	Nikt nie uwierzy w tę plotkę.
__label__pl	Tom zaginął.
__label__pl	Co robisz z tymi rzeczami?
__label__pl	Przekaż Tomowi moje podziękowania.
__label__pl	On jest historykiem.
__label__pl	Wiem, że Tom jest rozsądnym facetem.
__label__pl	Mamy teraz wybór.
__label__pl	Niektórzy mnisi lubią Monachium.
__label__pl	Niektóre rzeczy są niemożliwe.
__label__pl	Po prostu bądź sobą.
__label__pl	Niech pan po prostu będzie sobą.
__label__pl	Czy mogę przejść?
__label__pl	Nie mogą nas wiecznie chronić.
__label__pl	Czy zespawałeś to?
__label__pl	Czy zespawałaś to?
__label__pl	Czy zespawaliście to?
__label__pl	Do wypadku doszło przez zaniedbanie.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary powiedzieli, że byli zmęczeni.
__label__pl	Ludzie obrócili się i spojrzeli na Toma.
__label__pl	Telefon zadzwonił, ale nikt nie odebrał.
__label__pl	Tom zjadł sałatkę Mary.
__label__pl	Mówi, że dobrze pływa.
__label__pl	Czy jest was siedmioro?
__label__pl	Czy jest was siedmiu?
__label__pl	Czy jest was siedem?
__label__pl	Jakie imprezy lubicie?
__label__pl	Jadam owoce.
__label__pl	Tom chciał iść, ale Mary chciała zostać jeszcze chwilę.
__label__pl	Czy nie masz telewizora?
__label__pl	Jej firma nie przetrwała kryzysu.
__label__pl	Każdy jest bardzo podekscytowany.
__label__pl	To jest grób Toma.
__label__pl	Tom sam to zrobił wczoraj.
__label__pl	Mężczyzna, który wygląda jak ja, stojący obok mojej siostry, jest moim bratem-bliźniakiem.
__label__pl	Tom nie powinien być z nami.
__label__pl	Tokio to duże miasto.
__label__pl	Skąd o tym wiedziałeś?
__label__pl	Nie brakuje go.
__label__pl	Nic nie stracę.
__label__pl	Bierze swoją pracę poważnie.
__label__pl	Kościół uczy przedślubnej wstrzemięźliwości.
__label__pl	Nie powiedziałem tego tak.
__label__pl	Od tego czasu nie widziałem jej.
__label__pl	Algieria to piękne miejsce.
__label__pl	Tom jest naszym najstarszym synem.
__label__pl	Czy nie powiedziałem ci, żebyś nie nazywał mnie Tomem?
__label__pl	Nie mogę na nią patrzeć.
__label__pl	Zostanę w samochodzie.
__label__pl	Zostanę w aucie.
__label__pl	Ten dom ma pięćset lat.
__label__pl	Wszyscy moi przyjaciele ją lubią.
__label__pl	Robi, co może, czyż nie?
__label__pl	Nigdy nie byłam dobrą pływaczką.
__label__pl	Nigdy nie byłem dobrym pływakiem.
__label__pl	Ten samochód jest mój.
__label__pl	Rozwiedźmy się.
__label__pl	Weźmy rozwód.
__label__pl	Wyglądał na dość zmęczonego.
__label__pl	Nasze miasto ma tramwaje.
__label__pl	Myślałem, że nie przyjdą.
__label__pl	Musimy pójść schodami.
__label__pl	Zajmij miejsce!
__label__pl	Umiecie pływać, prawda?
__label__pl	Jestem Ukraińcem.
__label__pl	Jestem Ukrainką.
__label__pl	Odmawiam podpisania tego dokumentu.
__label__pl	Daj mi łyk twojego drinka.
__label__pl	To jest sygnalizacja świetlna.
__label__pl	Ona szuka mojej książki.
__label__pl	Woda jest brudna.
__label__pl	Zamknij swoją książkę.
__label__pl	Jezus cię nienawidzi.
__label__pl	Lubisz pomarańcze?
__label__pl	Lubi pan pomarańcze?
__label__pl	Złoty podział jest obserwowany wszędzie w przyrodzie.
__label__pl	Ekran ma rozdzielczość w proporcji 4:3.
__label__pl	Nie wtykaj nosa w cudze sprawy.
__label__pl	W nocy wszystkie koty są szare.
__label__pl	Dzieci, obudźcie się!
__label__pl	Toma tutaj nie ma.
__label__pl	Płótno było porwane w trzech miejscach.
__label__pl	Nie ma biletu.
__label__pl	Czy są jakieś punkty orientacyjne?
__label__pl	Wszystkie miejsca były już zajęte.
__label__pl	Przejście pod drabiną przyniesie jej pecha.
__label__pl	Drabinę schowałem w szopie, obok grabi.
__label__pl	Ta drabina nie wytrzyma nas obojga.
__label__pl	Czy możesz przytrzymać drabinę, póki na niej stoję?
__label__pl	Każda kanapka z majonezem nie będzie mi smakowała.
__label__pl	Wtedy do wanny wgramolił się kuzyn.
__label__pl	Tom chce kanapkę.
__label__pl	Upuściłem swoją kanapkę.
__label__pl	Skończyłem swoją kanapkę.
__label__pl	Kanapki są okropne.
__label__pl	Tom ukradł moją kanapkę.
__label__pl	Tom zjadł kanapkę.
__label__pl	Tom zrobił kanapkę.
__label__pl	Dziękuję za kanapkę.
__label__pl	Dzięki za kanapkę.
__label__pl	Tom robi kanapki.
__label__pl	To moja kanapka.
__label__pl	Daj mi swoją kanapkę.
__label__pl	Daj mi swoje jedzenie.
__label__pl	Dajcie mi swoje jedzenie.
__label__pl	Zjadłeś moją kanapkę.
__label__pl	Zjadłaś moją kanapkę.
__label__pl	Przyniosę kanapki.
__label__pl	Ta kanapka jest dobra.
__label__pl	Jedzą kanapki.
__label__pl	Zjadłem swoją kanapkę.
__label__pl	Oba pojazdy zapłonęły.
__label__pl	Ten pojazd jest niebezpieczny.
__label__pl	Pojazd został skradziony.
__label__pl	Pojazd jest skradziony.
__label__pl	Policja przeszukała pojazd Toma.
__label__pl	Tom teraz posiada trzy pojazdy.
__label__pl	Odejdź od pojazdu.
__label__pl	Żołnierze jadą na patrol w wojskowym pojeździe.
__label__pl	Nie zostawiaj cennych przedmiotów w swoim samochodzie.
__label__pl	Psy zdechły w gorącym pojeździe.
__label__pl	Czy masz broń w samochodzie?
__label__pl	Cena rejestracji pojazdu wzrosła.
__label__pl	Tom stracił panowanie nad pojazdem i uderzył w barierkę ochronną.
__label__pl	Wozy strażackie mają pierwszeństwo przed innymi pojazdami.
__label__pl	Zawsze jest wiele pojazdów na tej drodze.
__label__pl	Po raz pierwszy od ponad 6 lat stopa bezrobocia spadła poniżej 6%.
__label__pl	Zmieniłem swoje zdjęcie profilowe.
__label__pl	Tlenek węgla to trująca substancja powstająca przez niepełne spalanie związków węgla.
__label__pl	Najważniejszą sprawą w Igrzyskach Olimpijskich jest nie wygrana, ale udział.
__label__pl	Pańska kolej.
__label__pl	Tom nic nie wiedział.
__label__pl	Byłem na tyle głupi, aby w to uwierzyć.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że był bardzo łaskotliwy.
__label__pl	Tomek gonił złodzieja.
__label__pl	Tom ścigał włamywacza.
__label__pl	Ledwo mogłem w to uwierzyć.
__label__pl	Miło było cię poznać, a teraz odejdź.
__label__pl	Czy nie powinniśmy trzymać się za ręce?
__label__pl	Nikt nie może tego wiedzieć.
__label__pl	Nikt nie może wiedzieć.
__label__pl	Spóźnił się pan.
__label__pl	Spóźnili się.
__label__pl	Jesteś spóźniony.
__label__pl	Jesteś spóźniona.
__label__pl	Jestem dobry w szachach.
__label__pl	Napisał swoje imię.
__label__pl	Niech pan mi tego nie daje.
__label__pl	Nie dawaj mi tego.
__label__pl	Chcieliśmy przestać to robić, ale nam nie pozwolili.
__label__pl	Jestem bardzo zły.
__label__pl	Wierzą ci.
__label__pl	Wierzą panu.
__label__pl	Wierzą wam.
__label__pl	Tom prawdopodobnie wie.
__label__pl	Tom został ciężko pobity.
__label__pl	Jest kilka teorii.
__label__pl	Jest kilka opcji.
__label__pl	Tom rozpiął swoją kurtkę.
__label__pl	Zapomniałem o swojej kurtce.
__label__pl	Zapomniałam o swojej kurtce.
__label__pl	Chciałam kurtkę.
__label__pl	Załóż kurtkę.
__label__pl	Gdzie jest twoja kurtka?
__label__pl	To moja kurtka.
__label__pl	Czyja to kurtka?
__label__pl	Która kurtka jest twoja?
__label__pl	Lubię tę kurtkę.
__label__pl	Tom zaprojektował tę kurtkę.
__label__pl	Gdzie są wasze kurtki?
__label__pl	Gdzie są twoje kurtki?
__label__pl	Gdzie jest moja kurtka?
__label__pl	Chcę tę kurtkę.
__label__pl	Gwóźdź porwał jego kurtkę.
__label__pl	Ta kurtka ma guziki.
__label__pl	Lubię twoją kurtkę.
__label__pl	Tom kupił skórzaną kurtkę.
__label__pl	Nie zapomnij swojej kurtki.
__label__pl	Czy ona jest lekarzem?
__label__pl	Tom zdjął swoją kurtkę.
__label__pl	Tom założył swoją kurtkę.
__label__pl	Czy to nowa kurtka?
__label__pl	Wezmę kurtkę.
__label__pl	Ta kurtka całkiem dobrze pasuje.
__label__pl	Ta kurtka jest z Europy.
__label__pl	Tom nosi kurtkę.
__label__pl	Tom nie nosił kamizelki ratunkowej.
__label__pl	Nie nosiłem kamizelki ratunkowej.
__label__pl	Co powinnam ubrać - spodnie czy spódnicę?
__label__pl	Pobrałem to.
__label__pl	Tom często pobiera filmy.
__label__pl	Tom pobiera gry.
__label__pl	Pobieram książki.
__label__pl	Padam na pysk.
__label__pl	Pobieranie skończyło się.
__label__pl	Tom pobiera film.
__label__pl	Pobieram wtyczkę.
__label__pl	To jest bezpłatna gazeta.
__label__pl	Pobieram grę.
__label__pl	Ta gra pobiera się zbyt długo.
__label__pl	Pobrałem plik na swój komputer.
__label__pl	Ta gazeta jest bezpłatna.
__label__pl	Jak się pobiera zdjęcie z tej strony?
__label__pl	Ta książka może zostać pobrana za darmo.
__label__pl	Właśnie pobrałem mnóstwo plików.
__label__pl	Chcę pobrać tę grę.
__label__pl	Jak mogę pobrać ten plik?
__label__pl	Będę musiał to pobrać.
__label__pl	Tom pobrał dzisiaj kilka gier.
__label__pl	Ona jest uczennicą.
__label__pl	Czy pobrałeś aplikacje, o których ci mówiłem?
__label__pl	Czy pobrałeś aplikacje, o których ci mówiłam?
__label__pl	Czy pobrałaś aplikacje, o których ci mówiłam?
__label__pl	Czy pobrałaś aplikacje, o których ci mówiłem?
__label__pl	To tylko obraz, który pobrałem z internetu.
__label__pl	To tylko obraz, który pobrałam z internetu.

__label__pl	Pływałem szybciej, gdy byłem młody.
__label__pl	Wczoraj padał deszcz.
__label__pl	To nie do końca to, o co mi chodziło.
__label__pl	Odejdź teraz.
__label__pl	"Grexit" oznacza wyjście Grecji ze strefy euro.
__label__pl	Proszę o uwagę!
__label__pl	Yanni ma 40,000 dinarów w banku.
__label__pl	Nie musisz wysyłać mi listów. W każdym razie, nie mogę ich przeczytać.
__label__pl	Ani Tom, ani Mary nie zawarli zbyt wielu nowych znajomości.
__label__pl	Mary miała na sobie słomiany kapelusz.
__label__pl	Czy sztuczna inteligencja będzie w stanie zastąpić ludzi?
__label__pl	To zostanie prawdopodobnie wybaczone Tomowi.
__label__pl	Powinnam była zadzwonić do Toma.
__label__pl	Przeszukaj mnie.
__label__pl	Od lat był Muzułmaninem i jego rodzina nie wiedziała.
__label__pl	Zmarła.
__label__pl	Oni mnie zabiją.
__label__pl	Zginęła.
__label__pl	Nie zdawałem sobie sprawy, że Tom był tutaj nieszczęśliwy.
__label__pl	Muszę kupić prezenty na święta.
__label__pl	Zabije mnie pan.
__label__pl	Zwolnił się.
__label__pl	Dobrze jest mieć pieniądze.
__label__pl	Byłoby lepiej, gdybyś tego nie robił.
__label__pl	On spędził noc w motelu.
__label__pl	Co za arogancja!
__label__pl	On wydaje się być nieszczery.
__label__pl	Martwię się o ciebie.
__label__pl	Pozory mylą.
__label__pl	Pocałowały się.
__label__pl	Tom jest o trzy centymetry wyższy od Mary.
__label__pl	Nie wydaje mi się, żebyśmy mogli o siebie zadbać.
__label__pl	Nie mogę uwierzyć własnym oczom.
__label__pl	Pieniądze rządzą światem.
__label__pl	Tom nigdy by mnie nie skrzywdził.
__label__pl	Tom kocha ośmiobitową muzykę.
__label__pl	Nie jestem jeszcze przekonany.
__label__pl	Sami zaczął mieć atak paniki.
__label__pl	Powiem ci, kiedy będzie gotowe.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że kazano mu to znów zrobić.
__label__pl	Styczeń, luty, marzec, kwiecień, maj, czerwiec, lipiec, sierpień, wrzesień, październik, listopad i grudzień to dwanaście miesięcy roku.
__label__pl	Tom zawsze wydaje się pewny siebie.
__label__pl	Skąd znasz Toma?
__label__pl	Spotkanie poszło naprawdę dobrze.
__label__pl	Nie chcę, żebyś prał moje ubrania.
__label__pl	On mówi, że nie boli go brzuch.
__label__pl	Ile kosztuje kilogram cukru w Algierii?
__label__pl	Mary nie do końca wie, co powinna zrobić.
__label__pl	Tom nie będzie głodny.
__label__pl	Jeśli masz jakiś problem, daj mi znać.
__label__pl	Prawie zacząłem płakać.
__label__pl	Nie, nie będę dla ciebie gotować.
__label__pl	Ona wie, gdzie jej miejsce.
__label__pl	Nie możesz go skrzywdzić.
__label__pl	Proszę, pozwól mi iść z tobą.
__label__pl	Oni wszyscy są dosyć zmęczeni.
__label__pl	To jest to, czego chciałem się dowiedzieć.
__label__pl	Jak ktokolwiek mógłby nienawidzić tego kraju?
__label__pl	Jeśli będziesz zeznawał, Tom również będzie zeznawał.
__label__pl	Tom jest na spacerze z psami.
__label__pl	Tuż za tobą jest tygrys.
__label__pl	Jest lipiec.
__label__pl	Chcę, żeby mój ojciec zobaczył ten film.
__label__pl	Czy my jesteśmy szalonymi wiewiórkami?
__label__pl	To też jest dobry film.
__label__pl	Jadę do Bostonu na trzy miesiące.
__label__pl	Jak przeliterujesz "pretty"?
__label__pl	Droga prowadząca do hotelu jest wąska.
__label__pl	Chcesz iść z nami do galerii handlowej?
__label__pl	Jest kwadrans po dziewiątej.
__label__pl	Ukryliśmy się na wyspie.
__label__pl	Mam ból zęba.
__label__pl	Zamknij pysk!
__label__pl	Zamknij mordę!
__label__pl	Pozwól mi wejść do środka.
__label__pl	Spanikowałam.
__label__pl	Ćwiczyłam.
__label__pl	Ubierz się.
__label__pl	Wszystko się zatrzymało.
__label__pl	Sprawdźcie to.
__label__pl	Na zdrowie.
__label__pl	Zawiedliśmy.
__label__pl	Zawiodłyśmy.
__label__pl	Obiecałam.
__label__pl	Pomóżcie nam.
__label__pl	Nikt nie narzekał.
__label__pl	Poddał się.
__label__pl	Mów cicho.
__label__pl	Każdy plotkuje.
__label__pl	Cuchniesz.
__label__pl	Mów wolniej.
__label__pl	Dzwoń po ochronę.
__label__pl	Zwyciężyłem.
__label__pl	Modliłem się.
__label__pl	Ogoliłem się.
__label__pl	Mówiłem.
__label__pl	Mówiłam.
__label__pl	Przebrałam się.
__label__pl	Uciekłem.
__label__pl	Uciekłam.
__label__pl	Przeszedłem na emeryturę.
__label__pl	Przeszłam na emeryturę.
__label__pl	Zagwizdałem.
__label__pl	Zagwizdałam.
__label__pl	Pociągnij je.
__label__pl	Zabij je.
__label__pl	Zabij ich.
__label__pl	Miej wiarę.
__label__pl	Tom śmierdzi.
__label__pl	Tom cuchnie.
__label__pl	Skieruj się na północ.
__label__pl	Tom maluje.
__label__pl	Kto zapłacił?
__label__pl	Idź szybciej.
__label__pl	Tom zwymiotował.
__label__pl	Przestań gwizdać.
__label__pl	Zabij Toma.
__label__pl	Zabijcie Toma.
__label__pl	Tom zamarzł.
__label__pl	Tom rozebrał się.
__label__pl	Ugryź się w język!
__label__pl	Jestem wyższy.
__label__pl	Kocham komedie.
__label__pl	Lubię astrologię.
__label__pl	Kim jestem?
__label__pl	Czy jesteście uczniami?
__label__pl	Czy jesteście studentami?
__label__pl	Minęło czterdzieści lat.
__label__pl	Oboje żyją.
__label__pl	Obaj żyją.
__label__pl	Zważaj na swój język.
__label__pl	Wymieniliśmy pozdrowienia.
__label__pl	Lubimy muzykę.
__label__pl	Pozwól mi dokończyć.
__label__pl	Ceny spadły ostatnio.
__label__pl	Zobaczycie.
__label__pl	Czuję się winna.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy kuzynkami.
__label__pl	Jezus im odpowiedział.
__label__pl	Jesteś przepracowana.
__label__pl	Jesteście przepracowani.
__label__pl	Jesteście przepracowane.
__label__pl	Macie wszystko.
__label__pl	Jesteś nieuprzejma.
__label__pl	Jesteście nieuprzejmi.
__label__pl	Jesteście nieuprzejme.
__label__pl	Pachnie smakowicie.
__label__pl	Ty to powiedziałeś!
__label__pl	Syrena zawyła.
__label__pl	Nadaj ten list.
__label__pl	Weź tę aspirynę.
__label__pl	Małpy pną się po drzewach.
__label__pl	Czy to wszystko?
__label__pl	Zło czasem zwycięża.
__label__pl	Wszyscy byli cicho.
__label__pl	Poprosili go.
__label__pl	Poprosiły go.
__label__pl	Przyjdź znowu.
__label__pl	Trzymaj się tego!
__label__pl	Trzymaj linę.
__label__pl	Nikt się nie ruszył.
__label__pl	Pij odpowiedzialnie.
__label__pl	Pijcie odpowiedzialnie.
__label__pl	Tom zająknął się.
__label__pl	Każdy się przyglądał.
__label__pl	Każdy słuchał.
__label__pl	Każdy biegł.
__label__pl	Każdy zjadł.
__label__pl	Każdy przemówił.
__label__pl	Każdy się podpisał.

__label__pl	Ucz się włoskiego.
__label__pl	Naucz się włoskiego.
__label__pl	Wszystko ma znaczenie.
__label__pl	Zniknął.
__label__pl	Zapadł się pod ziemię.

__label__pl	Odstąp.
__label__pl	Zgłosiłam się na ochotnika.

__label__pl	Ktoś zaśpiewał.
__label__pl	Tom ukrył się.
__label__pl	Tom strzelił.
__label__pl	Tom przyglądał się.
__label__pl	Kto przegrał?
__label__pl	Jedz zdrowo.
__label__pl	Jedzcie zdrowo.
__label__pl	Bądź dobry.
__label__pl	Czy mógłbyś oddzwonić później?
__label__pl	Czy mógłbyś zadzwonić później, proszę?
__label__pl	Ile kanapek jeszcze zostało?
__label__pl	Zachowujcie się.
__label__pl	On mówi biegle po francusku.
__label__pl	Pływali.
__label__pl	Kiedy wystąpił błąd?
__label__pl	Bądź silna.
__label__pl	Bądźcie silni.

__label__pl	On jest bardzo seksowny.
__label__pl	Jestem w ósmej klasie.
__label__pl	Jestem Chinką.
__label__pl	Tom gra w krykieta.
__label__pl	Witamy na naszej pierwszej lekcji niemieckiego.
__label__pl	Nie było mnie przez rok.
__label__pl	Kto jeszcze tam był?
__label__pl	Pozwól mi rzucić na to okiem.

__label__pl	Nauczyciel i ja siedzieliśmy naprzeciwko siebie.
__label__pl	Nauczyciel i ja siedzieliśmy twarzą w twarz.
__label__pl	Czy jest pan tego pewien?
__label__pl	Mój francuski nie jest szczególnie dobry.
__label__pl	Zamrugał.
__label__pl	Mrugnął.
__label__pl	Mój stanik jest brudny.
__label__pl	Mój biustonosz jest brudny.

__label__pl	Czuję się z nim bezpiecznie.
__label__pl	Tom był jedynym niezaproszonym.
__label__pl	Ma dużo z nią wspólnego.
__label__pl	Jak Boga kocham, nigdy nie kłamię.
__label__pl	Hej, to działa.
__label__pl	Myślisz, że będzie zimno dzisiaj?
__label__pl	Wiedzą, co się stało.
__label__pl	On mógłby być geniuszem.
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie odpowiadasz?

__label__pl	Ptak jest martwy.
__label__pl	Jest za kwadrans druga.
__label__pl	Chciałbym mieć więcej.
__label__pl	Co robiłeś przez cały ten czas!

__label__pl	Nikt nie potrafi przewidzieć przyszłości.
__label__pl	Martwię się o twoją przyszłość.
__label__pl	Porozmawiajmy o przyszłości.
__label__pl	Musimy zainwestować w naszą przyszłość.

__label__pl	Tom powiedział Mary o swoich planach na przyszłość.
__label__pl	Czy Tom jest miejscowym?
__label__pl	Jesteś miejscowy, prawda?
__label__pl	Myśl globalnie, działaj lokalnie.

__label__pl	Coś pamiętam.
__label__pl	Przyszedłem po Toma.
__label__pl	Przyszedłem zamiast Toma.
__label__pl	Tom jest przeciwko małżeństwom jednopłciowym.
__label__pl	Pary jednopłciowe powinny móc wziąć ślub.
__label__pl	Świat kręci się wokół seksu, pieniędzy, i narkotyków.
__label__pl	Obaj się roześmiali.
__label__pl	Obie się roześmiały.

__label__pl	Tom śmiał się, a Mary uśmiechnęła się.
__label__pl	Poza Tomem wszyscy śmiali się.
__label__pl	Tom śmiał mi się w twarz.
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie oba?

__label__pl	Co ona przez to rozumie?
__label__pl	Puzzle są fajne.
__label__pl	Czy to nie ma sensu?
__label__pl	Cel został osiągnięty.
__label__pl	Wezwałem pomoc.
__label__pl	Chcę trochę ziemniaków.
__label__pl	Przetnij to na dwie części.
__label__pl	Zatrzymamy Toma.
__label__pl	Jestem ci winien 3000 jenów.
__label__pl	Jestem ci dłużny 3000 jenów.
__label__pl	Tom był w bibliotece.
__label__pl	Nie jesteś mężem Marii?
__label__pl	Autobus zatrzymał się.

__label__pl	Król nadużył swojej władzy.

__label__pl	Dlaczego śpiewasz?
__label__pl	Dlaczego pan śpiewa?
__label__pl	Dlaczego pani śpiewa?
__label__pl	Dlaczego państwo śpiewają?
__label__pl	Dlaczego śpiewacie?
__label__pl	Widzimy.
__label__pl	Czy jeden z was zawsze tu jest?
__label__pl	To bardzo głupie.
__label__pl	Nikogo innego tu nie ma.
__label__pl	Tom jest w drużynie siatkówki.
__label__pl	Nie zapomnij zapiąć pasów.
__label__pl	Chciałbym, żebyś pomógł Tomowi.
__label__pl	Straciłam zainteresowanie.
__label__pl	Straciłem zainteresowanie.
__label__pl	Zawsze możesz wrócić.
__label__pl	Lubię zimno.
__label__pl	Potrzebuję drabiny.
__label__pl	Smakowało mi to.
__label__pl	Zostałeś zawieszony.
__label__pl	Został pan zawieszony.
__label__pl	Została pani zawieszona.
__label__pl	Zostali państwo zawieszeni.
__label__pl	Teraz ty spróbuj.
__label__pl	Czego się obawiasz?
__label__pl	Czego się obawiacie?
__label__pl	Dlaczego zostałeś zwolniony?
__label__pl	Tom potrzebuje gotówki.
__label__pl	Tom potrzebuje trochę gotówki.
__label__pl	Kto się skarżył?
__label__pl	Wydawało się to tanie.
__label__pl	Jestem dwukrotnie starszy od ciebie.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy okropni.
__label__pl	Tom biegł.
__label__pl	Nie podążaj za mną.
__label__pl	Nie idź za mną.
__label__pl	Użyj pięści.
__label__pl	Nie pozwalam na to.
__label__pl	Śmierdziało paskudnie.
__label__pl	Witam, czy mogę rozmawiać z Tomem?
__label__pl	Kupiłem kilka znaczków.
__label__pl	Żarty na bok.
__label__pl	Tom nie może tego wytrzymać.
__label__pl	Tom nie może tego znieść.
__label__pl	Tom ma przyjaciela, który mieszka w Bostonie.
__label__pl	Tom ma przyjaciela mieszkającego w Bostonie.
__label__pl	Niech pan usiądzie!
__label__pl	Pomagam ci.
__label__pl	Wszyscy go podziwiają.
__label__pl	Przyjemność po mojej stronie.
__label__pl	Zwykle jemy nożem, widelcem i łyżką.
__label__pl	Proszę przynieść swój widelec i swoją łyżkę.
__label__pl	Gdzie położyłem płaszcz?
__label__pl	Nie mogę uwierzyć, że o tym zapomniałem.
__label__pl	Czy to prawda, że wczoraj byłeś nieobecny?
__label__pl	Czy to prawda, że wczoraj cię nie było?
__label__pl	Czy to prawda, że wczoraj cię tu nie było?
__label__pl	Czy to prawda, że nie było cię tu wczoraj?
__label__pl	Jest tanie.
__label__pl	To było dekady temu.
__label__pl	Dekada to dziesięć lat.
__label__pl	To było ponad dekadę temu.
__label__pl	To stało się dekady temu.
__label__pl	Nie było tak gorąco od dekad.
__label__pl	Tom nie pracował od ponad dekady.
__label__pl	Zjedliśmy śniadanie.
__label__pl	Zjadłyśmy śniadanie.
__label__pl	Skończył śniadanie.
__label__pl	Śniadanie podano.
__label__pl	Zrobiłem śniadanie.
__label__pl	Tom zjadł śniadanie.
__label__pl	Kto ugotował śniadanie?
__label__pl	Zjedzmy śniadanie.
__label__pl	Powinna zjeść śniadanie.
__label__pl	Opisz swoje idealne śniadanie.
__label__pl	Tom wyszedł po śniadaniu.
__label__pl	Powinnaś zjeść śniadanie.
__label__pl	Tom je śniadanie.
__label__pl	Śniadanie zostanie podane.
__label__pl	Śniadanie było bardzo dobre.
__label__pl	Tom powinien zjeść śniadanie.
__label__pl	Zjedz zdrowe śniadanie.
__label__pl	Gotuję śniadanie.
__label__pl	Tom zazwyczaj pomija śniadanie.
__label__pl	Śniadanie jest prawie gotowe.
__label__pl	Zjadłeś śniadanie?
__label__pl	Zjadłaś śniadanie?
__label__pl	Kiedy ostatnio tańczyłaś?
__label__pl	Kiedy ostatnio tańczyłeś?
__label__pl	Tom jest mądrym chłopcem.
__label__pl	Chciałbym się pożegnać.
__label__pl	Chcę się pożegnać.
__label__pl	Chciałabym się pożegnać.
__label__pl	Ptaki składają jaja.
__label__pl	Niech pan zajmie się tym jutro.
__label__pl	Kogo się spodziewaliście?
__label__pl	Otwórz butelkę.
__label__pl	Mam około 5000 jenów.
__label__pl	Mam mniej więcej 5000 jenów.
__label__pl	Czego się spodziewaliście?
__label__pl	Czego się spodziewałeś?
__label__pl	Jaki ma pan rozmiar?
__label__pl	Kogo się pan spodziewał?
__label__pl	Nie możecie przestać.
__label__pl	Szukam bankomatu.
__label__pl	Co jest tak pilne?
__label__pl	Myślałem, że to była butelka.
__label__pl	Nie oczekujcie cudów.
__label__pl	Nie oczekuj cudów.
__label__pl	Puść butelkę.
__label__pl	Tom chciał kontynuować.
__label__pl	To jest trudne do opisania.
__label__pl	Właśnie je lunch.
__label__pl	Właśnie je obiad.
__label__pl	Za kogo mnie uważasz?
__label__pl	Może pan tutaj palić.
__label__pl	Tom praktycznie nic nie powiedział.
__label__pl	Tom rzadko się odzywał.
__label__pl	Nie dojdzie do tego.
__label__pl	Jest przyjemnie chłodno.
__label__pl	Nie możemy zaoferować ci żadnych pieniędzy.
__label__pl	Słuchamy.
__label__pl	Wypij swój sok.
__label__pl	To w zupełności wystarczy.
__label__pl	On jest jednym z moich najlepszych przyjaciół.
__label__pl	Odkurzyłem samochód.
__label__pl	Która jest teraz godzina w San Francisco?
__label__pl	Nie możesz nas tu przetrzymywać.
__label__pl	Nie możesz nas tu trzymać.
__label__pl	Twój garaż płonie.
__label__pl	Są sprytni.
__label__pl	Jest pan sprytny.
__label__pl	Tom ma lęk wysokości.
__label__pl	Jesteś niechlujny.
__label__pl	Jestem pacjentem.
__label__pl	Jak często się golisz?
__label__pl	Nie mieszkają tu bogaci ludzie.
__label__pl	Zarezerwowałem miejsce.
__label__pl	Zupa jest za słona.
__label__pl	To dobry system.
__label__pl	To bardzo smutna historia.
__label__pl	To bardzo smutna opowieść.
__label__pl	Zadzwoń do Toma i powiedz mu, że się spóźnisz.
__label__pl	Ci ludzie nie mieli teraz pracy.
__label__pl	Czekam na nią od godziny.
__label__pl	Nigdy wcześniej nie jeździłem na koniu.
__label__pl	Byłeś bardzo zajęty, prawda?
__label__pl	Jestem naprawdę dumny ze swoich studentów.
__label__pl	Mieszka pan naprzeciwko?
__label__pl	Proszę, czuj się jak u siebie w domu.
__label__pl	Większość konsumentów jest przeciwko plastikowym torbom.
__label__pl	Pośród uchodźców jest wiele dzieci.
__label__pl	Może to czego chcę nie ma już znaczenia.
__label__pl	Złodziej zbił okno.
__label__pl	Należysz do mnie.
__label__pl	Tom wrócił do swojego samochodu.
__label__pl	Umyłeś zęby?
__label__pl	Nie chciałbyś zobaczyć mojej kolekcji znaczków?
__label__pl	Naprawdę powinieneś wyczyścić swojego laptopa od czasu do czasu.
__label__pl	Możesz rozwalić swoją gitarę na scenie, ale następnej ci nie kupię.
__label__pl	Nie baw się wykałaczkami przy buzi.
__label__pl	Zostaw tego pingwina w spokoju.
__label__pl	Ten mężczyzna naprawdę próbował mi wmówić, że jeździł w zoo na nosorożcu.
__label__pl	Nie powinieneś sobie już iść?
__label__pl	Chciałbym iść spać, ale ktoś ukradł mój materac.
__label__pl	Wszystkie magazyny idą do wywalenia.
__label__pl	Moja pasierbica nie przepada za oberżyną.
__label__pl	Co to za japońskie bajki?
__label__pl	Co twoja szczoteczka robi w moim kubku na kawę?
__label__pl	"Stary, nie cierpię mojej żony." "Rozumiem cię, ja też nie cierpię twojej żony."
__label__pl	Na co ci szkoła, kiedy masz Internet?
__label__pl	Jego chłopak przyjdzie w odwiedziny, ubierz się ładnie.
__label__pl	Ach tak, nie ma nic lepszego niż wstawanie o piątej rano.
__label__pl	Skończ gadać bzdury i pomóż mi przenieść to pudło.
__label__pl	Na twoim miejscu nie piłbym tego bimbru.
__label__pl	Daj mi inną drabinę, ta za bardzo się chwieje.
__label__pl	Może mi Pan nie wierzyć, ale naprawdę nie znam żadnego człowieka imieniem Tom.
__label__pl	Żona Toma? Słyszałam, że uciekła od niego i wyjechała do Meksyku.
__label__pl	Dałbyś wiarę, że tak małe stworzonko może dać człowiekowi tyle radości?
__label__pl	Panie Arku, prosimy skontaktować się z zarządem.
__label__pl	Kupiłeś chleb razowy tak jak cię prosiłam?
__label__pl	Proszę nie zawracać głowy mojemu synowi.
__label__pl	Prawie połowa uczniów nie zdołała zdać egzaminu.
__label__pl	Mamy nadwyżkę.
__label__pl	Mamy nadwyżkę jedzenia.
__label__pl	Obalę dyktatora.
__label__pl	Nie jesteś spokrewniony ze mną.
__label__pl	Mam krwawe stolce.
__label__pl	Mogę jeść kiedy tylko chcę.
__label__pl	Ona uczy swoich przyjaciół francuskiego.
__label__pl	Jedziesz do Bostonu w następnym tygodniu?
__label__pl	Co sprawia, że myślisz, że Tom to zrobił?
__label__pl	Jego mowa zakrawała o absurd.
__label__pl	Czasem lepiej jest kłamać.
__label__pl	W biurze muszę nosić krawat.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary pewnie nie wiedzą co potrzebują kupić.
__label__pl	Ona uwielbia muzykę.
__label__pl	Mówią że są dumni ze swoich dzieci.
__label__pl	Czyjego parasola użyłeś?
__label__pl	Hunowie splądrowali wioskę i doszczętnie ją spalili.
__label__pl	Tom jest deweloperem gier wideo.
__label__pl	Planuję spędzić urlop w Bostonie.
__label__pl	Tom coś knuje.
__label__pl	Zdecydowanie robimy postępy.
__label__pl	To było stresujące.
__label__pl	Boję się, że mamy duży problem.
__label__pl	Ja tego sprzątać nie będę.
__label__pl	Nie przyjeżdżam w tym roku do Australii.
__label__pl	Jestem tu od roku.
__label__pl	To musi zostać rozebrane.
__label__pl	Jestem zadowolony z wyniku wyborów.
__label__pl	Nadal jest trochę zajęty, prawda?
__label__pl	Nie jest zainteresowany, prawda?
__label__pl	Nauka języków nigdy nie była tak łatwa.
__label__pl	Są ludzie, którzy wykorzystują niepełnosprawnych dla własnego zysku.
__label__pl	Tą starszą kobietę stać tylko albo na leki, albo na jedzenie.
__label__pl	Wszyscy faceci których znam lubią samochody.
__label__pl	Wyłącz wiatrak.
__label__pl	Wiem, że Tom nie jest w stanie tego zrobić zbyt dobrze.
__label__pl	Dlaczego oni ją przesłuchują?
__label__pl	Chcę by umarł.
__label__pl	Tu jest twoje lekarstwo.
__label__pl	Nikt nie będzie za tobą tęsknił.
__label__pl	Tom jest ksenofobem.
__label__pl	Kiedy ma miejsce ta konferencja prasowa?
__label__pl	Nauczyłbyś mnie grać w szachy?
__label__pl	Tom zniknął rok temu.
__label__pl	Tom zapytał mnie, czy nie chciałbym pojechać z nim do Australii.
__label__pl	Również to zauważyłem.
__label__pl	Tom kocha zachody słońca.
__label__pl	Ten człowiek jest szalony.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary chyba nie zamierzają zjeść tego wszystkiego sami, prawda?
__label__pl	Kto chciałby go skrzywdzić?
__label__pl	Ten chłopiec mówi po francusku.
__label__pl	Nie wierzę w życie pozaziemskie.
__label__pl	Tom założył buty.
__label__pl	Tom kopnął mnie pod stołem.
__label__pl	Tom dał swojego kota Mary.
__label__pl	Przyjdź we wtorek, jeśli to możliwe.
__label__pl	Zasłaniaj usta kiedy kaszlesz, kichasz albo ziewasz.
__label__pl	Do tej pory byłem w Europie pięć razy: w 1995, 1998, 2000, 2002, i 2004.
__label__pl	Ja jestem tym, który zbudował ten dom.
__label__pl	Tom ukrył się w górach, ponieważ nie chciał zostać złapany przez policję.
__label__pl	Odziedziczyła niebieskie oczy po matce.
__label__pl	Tom myśli, że Mary nie zapłacze.
__label__pl	Jeszcze się nie zdecydowała.
__label__pl	"Czy Tom jest uczniem?" "Tak, jest studentem."
__label__pl	Przykro mi, że nie miałem okazji pożegnać się z Tomem.
__label__pl	Tom ma nadzieję, że Mary nie odkryje prawdy.
__label__pl	Czy jest ktoś, kogo chcesz zaprosić na moją imprezę?
__label__pl	Mówi się, że jest bardzo bogaty.
__label__pl	Łódź podwodna w końcu wypłynęła na powierzchnię.
__label__pl	Nie zrobiłem bardzo wielu zdjęć.
__label__pl	Trochę późno o tym pomyślałeś.
__label__pl	W północnej Afryce leży państwo zwane Algieria.
__label__pl	Nauczyłem się im ufać.
__label__pl	Są w swoich biurach.
__label__pl	Tom z Mary powiedzieli, że nie mają nic do ukrycia.
__label__pl	To powolny proces.
__label__pl	Mam dość oglądania telewizji. Zróbmy coś innego.
__label__pl	Tom nie jest tym, który wygrał nagrodę.
__label__pl	Patrzyłem, jak Tom wsiada do auta.
__label__pl	Musimy szybko zmobilizować nasze siły, jeśli chcemy odnieść sukces.
__label__pl	Jestem tego pewien w stu procentach.
__label__pl	Pochylił się i wyszeptał jej coś do ucha.
__label__pl	Być może jest muzułmaninem.
__label__pl	Nie chcę iść do domu sam.
__label__pl	Tom przyłożył palec do ust.
__label__pl	Słyszałem jak Tom wychodzi.
__label__pl	Bylibyśmy bliżej prawdy.
__label__pl	Nie musisz mi niczego dawać.
__label__pl	Tak naprawdę Tom tego nie potrzebuje.
__label__pl	Widziałem Mary siedzącą na kolanach Toma.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że Mary skończyła.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że nie wiedział kim była Mary.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary rozmawiali cicho w kącie.
__label__pl	Ten rower jest taki jak ten, który posiadam.
__label__pl	On pakuje swoje rzeczy do pudełek.
__label__pl	Wybiegliśmy z budynku.
__label__pl	Tom zaciął się przy goleniu.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że Mary często to robi.
__label__pl	Nie poszedłem wczoraj do szkoły.
__label__pl	Tom nie wie niczego o Mary.
__label__pl	Też tam byłeś?
__label__pl	Dobra, dzięki, teraz rozumiem.
__label__pl	Dlaczego robisz z tego taki wielki problem?
__label__pl	Mam nadzieję, że tam będę.
__label__pl	Świetnie się dziś bawiłem.
__label__pl	Zrobiłem moją pracę domową w godzinę.
__label__pl	Możesz mówić co chcesz, ale ja nigdy ci nie wybaczę.
__label__pl	Tom udawał, że jest lekarzem.
__label__pl	Twoja siostra jest młodsza od mojej.
__label__pl	Każdy ma prawo do bycia głupim. Niektórzy po prostu nadużywają tego przywileju.
__label__pl	Wiemy, że jeśli my mamy ten problem, to wszyscy inni również go mają.
__label__pl	Mój wujek wyjechał do Meksyku w 1983 i nigdy nie powrócił.
__label__pl	Już dla nich nie pracuję.
__label__pl	Tom nigdy nie był dla mnie wredny.
__label__pl	Jak dotrę stąd na pocztę?
__label__pl	Ja też chcę wołowinę.
__label__pl	Nie powinniśmy tam iść.
__label__pl	Nie pozwalaj dzieciom oglądać tego filmu.
__label__pl	Mój lekarz powiedział mi, że nie piłem wystarczająco dużo wody.
__label__pl	Ten szczeniaczek nie jest na sprzedaż; jest do adopcji.
__label__pl	Wszystko teraz powraca.
__label__pl	Zaśpiewała piękną piosenkę.
__label__pl	Powiedziała mu, że napisała ten wiersz dwa lata wcześniej.
__label__pl	Tom miał nadzieję, że pies Mary go polubi.
__label__pl	Pudełko nie jest wliczone w cenę.
__label__pl	Tom jest samolubny, prawda?
__label__pl	Jestem muzułmaninem i nie jem wieprzowiny.
__label__pl	Tom jest marzycielem, nieprawdaż?
__label__pl	Proszę, pokaż mi jak używać tej zmywarki.
__label__pl	Kilka godzin później, Tom i Mary byli martwi.
__label__pl	Musisz ich znaleźć.
__label__pl	Tom nie martwił się o Mary.
__label__pl	Nie lubię być na diecie.
__label__pl	Jestem pewien, że Tom nie zrobi tego dla mnie.
__label__pl	Tom nie opowiada nam żartów zbyt często.
__label__pl	Tom zapomniał założyć dziś bieliznę.
__label__pl	Właśnie dlatego Tom jest przedmiotem dochodzenia.
__label__pl	Dlaczego jesteś taka miła?
__label__pl	Sam tego do końca nie rozumiem.
__label__pl	Mary będzie miała kłopoty jeśli zje wszystkie ciasteczka.
__label__pl	Jesteś zawiedziony, prawda?
__label__pl	Mary powiedziała, że mogłaby to zrobić.
__label__pl	Zadał mi parę pytań o nią.
__label__pl	Czy twojej dziewczynie podobały się kwiaty?
__label__pl	To może zadziałać, ale jest zbyt ryzykowne.
__label__pl	To było tak nieprofesjonalne.
__label__pl	Ona nie pozwoli mi się już więcej dać przytulić.
__label__pl	Nie chcę jeść lodów na deser.
__label__pl	Nikt nie tańczy trzeźwy.
__label__pl	Jestem pewien, że Tom znowu to zrobi.
__label__pl	Tom obiecał, że już nigdy więcej się nie spóźni.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy w formie.
__label__pl	Czy Tom nie złamał sobie kostki?
__label__pl	Miasto w którym dorastałem jest bardzo piękne.
__label__pl	Zdaje mi się, że Tom nosi tupecik.
__label__pl	Powinna była mu zapłacić.
__label__pl	Ben, pozmywaj naczynia.
__label__pl	Chcę żyć we Francji.
__label__pl	Czy to są bracia Toma?
__label__pl	Rozejrzę się za innym miejscem do życia.
__label__pl	Tom nigdy nie oczekiwał, że Mary naprawdę dochowałaby obietnicy.
__label__pl	Tom nie miał na sobie kapoka.
__label__pl	Ona myśli, że jest dobrym kierowcą.
__label__pl	Chcę sobie wytatuować smoka na plecach.
__label__pl	Kocham grać w pasjansa.
__label__pl	Robiliśmy to razem.
__label__pl	Zrób krok, a będziesz martwy.
__label__pl	Pozwól mi pomóc ci wybrać, którą sukienkę założyć.
__label__pl	Tom robi kawę w kuchni.
__label__pl	Powiedzieli mi, że byli poirytowani.
__label__pl	Tom uzbroił się.
__label__pl	Proszę, przeczytaj to bardzo uważnie.
__label__pl	Niektórzy nie wiedzieli, jak walczyć.
__label__pl	Pan Jackson uczy nas historii.
__label__pl	Czy życie w Algierii jest koszmarem?
__label__pl	To wymaga odrobiny praktyki.
__label__pl	Usłyszał to.
__label__pl	Tom wziął swoją skrzynkę z narzędziami i poszedł do domu.
__label__pl	Biorę ślub w przyszłym tygodniu.
__label__pl	Tom posadził małą morelę przed swoim domem.
__label__pl	Tom jest w stanie się teraz śmiać.
__label__pl	Nie sądziłem, że przyjdziesz na moje przyjęcie.
__label__pl	"Co to za muzyka?" "To techno."
__label__pl	Tom jest doświadczonym żeglarzem.
__label__pl	Nie sądzę, aby Tom lubił szpinak.
__label__pl	To nie jest to na co liczyłem.
__label__pl	Próbowałem przeprosić Toma.
__label__pl	Sami chce się tu przeprowadzić.
__label__pl	Tom nie mówił po francusku.
__label__pl	Ja jestem winnym porażki mojego syna.
__label__pl	Wyglądał, jakby nie był zajęty.
__label__pl	Twój strzał może się nie udać.
__label__pl	Twój strzał może się nie powieść.
__label__pl	Oni będą pierwszymi
__label__pl	To tutaj zrobiłem dla Ciebie.
__label__pl	Powiem ci kilka rzeczy o twojej pannie młodej, o których pewnie nie wiedziałeś.
__label__pl	Powiem ci kilka rzeczy o twojej pannie młodej, o których pewnie nie miałeś pojęcia.
__label__pl	On nie idzie.
__label__pl	On nie pójdzie.
__label__pl	Tom przeprowadza się jutro do Bostonu.

__label__pl	Kiedy zaczyna się podróż?
__label__pl	Zaśmiał się hucznie.
__label__pl	Zaśmiał się głośno.
__label__pl	Była zawiedziona.
__label__pl	Pozostał bez słów.
__label__pl	Milczała.
__label__pl	Osłupiał.

__label__pl	Nadeszła pora.
__label__pl	Wyczuł kłamstwo.
__label__pl	Czy którykolwiek uciekł?

__label__pl	Ile nożyczek zostało w zestawie?
__label__pl	Czy to gęś?
__label__pl	Rok 2020 dał nam lekcję życia, przypominając nam, że nie jesteśmy panami świata.
__label__pl	Jedyną gwarancją niepowodzenia jest niepróbowanie.
__label__pl	On też się zaśmiał.
__label__pl	Narysował koło za pomocą kompasu.
__label__pl	Ostatnia symfonia tego kompozytora jest tą najbardziej znaną.
__label__pl	Mam przeczucie, że ona dzisiaj przyjdzie.
__label__pl	Zmiana jest dobra, chociaż bywa bolesna.
__label__pl	On też to widział.
__label__pl	Myślę, że wygramy.
__label__pl	Uważam, że wygramy
__label__pl	Wydaje mi się, że wygramy.

__label__pl	To nasz wewnętrzny żart.
__label__pl	Uwielbiam swoich rodziców
__label__pl	Nie miałam grosza przy duszy.
__label__pl	Nie miałam grosza w kieszeni.
__label__pl	Mogę to wszystko zrobić sama.
__label__pl	Chciałbym, ale nie mogę.
__label__pl	Chciałbym ożenić się z kimś takim jak ty.
__label__pl	Chciałabym wyjść za mąż, za kogoś takiego jak ty.
__label__pl	To pytanie wydaje się skomplikowane.
__label__pl	Pomarańcze są dobrym źródłem witaminy C.
__label__pl	Przez następne siedem lat będę w Maroku.
__label__pl	Kwiaty będą niedługo kwitnąć.
__label__pl	Dzisiaj nie ma chleba.
__label__pl	Trzy worki piasku wypadły z ciężarówki i rozsypały się na drodze.
__label__pl	Nie ma sensu się kłócić.
__label__pl	Tom, co się stało?
__label__pl	Wyślij znajomym zdjęcie tablicy rejestracyjnej samochodu, do którego wsiadasz.
__label__pl	Chodzi po rozżarzonych węglach.
__label__pl	Zasię im rzekł Jezus, mówiąc: Jam jest światłość świata; kto mię naśladuje, nie będzie chodził w ciemności, ale będzie miał światłość żywota.

__label__pl	Nie jestem uchodźcą.
__label__pl	Czasami jem salami.
__label__pl	Ale z Ciebie ziółko!
__label__pl	Powiedzieli, że uważają, że byłem zabawny.
__label__pl	Mennad obserwuje.
__label__pl	Jak przekonałeś Toma, by Ci pomógł?
__label__pl	Pan zadzwonił w Pańskiej nieobecności, Panie.
__label__pl	Są sami ze sobą, nie?
__label__pl	Oczywiście kłamał.
__label__pl	Tom naprawia rzeczy.
__label__pl	Tom jest niski.
__label__pl	Czy jesteś niska?

__label__pl	Mam krótkie nogi.
__label__pl	Tom nosi szorty.
__label__pl	Przyznaje, że często płacze.
__label__pl	Widzę cel.
__label__pl	Widzę tarczę.
__label__pl	Wycelowałem swój pistolet w tarczę.
__label__pl	Tomás jest szybszy, niż myślisz.
__label__pl	Co powiedział kardiolog?
__label__pl	Ty też gotujesz?
__label__pl	Też gotujesz?

__label__pl	Tom już nie musi chodzić do szkoły.
__label__pl	Mary i Tom bili się o pilot do telewizora.
__label__pl	Tom nie cierpi na żadną chorobę, tylko na uzależnienie od leków.
__label__pl	Jedyną stałą rzeczą jest zmiana.
__label__pl	Nic nie jest tak pewne, jak zmiana
__label__pl	Nie wiedziałem, że Tom był w pokoju.
__label__pl	Odrzucili wszelkie sugestie zawarcia porozumienia pokojowego z człowiekiem, którego uznawali za radykała.
__label__pl	Tom czyta już teksty po koreańsku, chociaż jeszcze nie może rozmawiać.
__label__pl	Odmówiłam tym czasopismom publikacji moich fotografii, jednak mimo to, użyli ich w swoich oszczerczych artykułach.
__label__pl	Winszuj mi dużo zdrowia, bo to mi się przyda najbardziej.
__label__pl	Można tu również z bliska obserwować drobne zwierzęta wodne, takie jak na przykład nartnik – fascynujący, choć pospolity owad wykorzystujący napięcie powierzchniowe do ślizgania się po tafli wody.
__label__pl	To jezioro jest daleko stąd.
__label__pl	Ale jednak byłaś szczęśliwa, prawda?
__label__pl	Uwielbialiśmy wino.
__label__pl	My wiemy, kim oni są.
__label__pl	Ona kupuje to, co zechce, nie zważając na cenę.
__label__pl	Kupuje to co chce, bez względu na cenę.
__label__pl	Tom zrobił to dla ciebie?
__label__pl	Tom pomaga mi z francuskim.
__label__pl	Dokąd chcecie iść?
__label__pl	Tom znalazł na swoim podwórku trzy złote monety.
__label__pl	Ta powieść jest napisana przez znanego amerykańskiego pisarza.
__label__pl	Na fotografii wszyscy się uśmiechają.
__label__pl	A gdzie wasze rzeczy?
__label__pl	"Ej, zrobiłeś zadaniem z matematyki?" - "A, cholera, zupełnie zapomniałem"
__label__pl	To bardzo miła dziewczyna.
__label__pl	Byłem zły na Toma.
__label__pl	Co jest nie tak z zoo?
__label__pl	Co takiego wiesz o Tomie, czego nie wiem ja?
__label__pl	Słyszałam, że uczycie się angielskiego?
__label__pl	Słyszałem, że uczy się Pan angielskiego?
__label__pl	Kiedy będziemy mogli się z nim zobaczyć?
__label__pl	Zupełnie nie potrafię wyrażać swoich uczuć.
__label__pl	On nigdy nie czyta gazet.
__label__pl	Tom nie będzie nam pomagać.
__label__pl	Rzadko spotkasz takich ludzi jak Tom.
__label__pl	Nie zapominajcie, że jest kobietą!
__label__pl	Ten jest nowy.
__label__pl	Tom chce kupić mój stary samochód.
__label__pl	Ktoś powinien powiedzieć Tomowi co robić.
__label__pl	Wracajcie do pracy!
__label__pl	Wracajcie do roboty!
__label__pl	Po prostu nie mogę spać.
__label__pl	Co możecie dla nas zrobić?
__label__pl	Co może Pani dla nas zrobić?
__label__pl	Beze mnie byście nie wygrali.
__label__pl	Nie wygralibyście beze mnie.
__label__pl	Możesz zatrzymać się u mnie.
__label__pl	Obroża się zepsuła i pies uciekł.
__label__pl	Obroża się złamała, a pies uciekł.
__label__pl	Twoja żona to bardzo utalentowana kobieta.
__label__pl	Słyszeliście już tę historię?
__label__pl	Nie możemy ich ochronić.
__label__pl	Znałem twoich rodziców.
__label__pl	Toma zaaresztowano i umieszczono w izolatce.
__label__pl	Mój angielski jest bardzo kiepski.
__label__pl	Nikt nie chce być wolontariuszem.
__label__pl	Kocham swojego syna.
__label__pl	Ona szyła.
__label__pl	Dajcie mi pospać!
__label__pl	Tom poświęcił dla was wszystko.
__label__pl	U nas w szkole zajęcia zaczynają się o ósmej.
__label__pl	W naszej szkole lekcje zaczynają się o ósmej.
__label__pl	To bardzo duże miasto.
__label__pl	Nie mam czasu pomagać wam w lekcjach.
__label__pl	Zdaje się, że jest teraz bogaty.
__label__pl	Lepiej, żebyście już pojechali.
__label__pl	Powinniście jechać.
__label__pl	Sami kupił Layla drinki
__label__pl	Jaki zwariowany świat.
__label__pl	Nawet policja czasami jeździ po wypiciu.
__label__pl	Z przyjemnością pomogę.
__label__pl	Proszę ucz mnie francuskiego.
__label__pl	Jaką dziś mamy pogodę.
__label__pl	Mam ci zrobić kawę?
__label__pl	On nosi rękawiczki
__label__pl	On jest twoim przyjacielem?
__label__pl	Chcę rozmawiać z twoim menadżerem.
__label__pl	Proponuję to zrobić
__label__pl	Rzadko rozmawiam z Tomem
__label__pl	Znowu pada śnieg.
__label__pl	W pociągu pełno było pasażerów.
__label__pl	Dałem mu wszystkie pieniądze, jakie miałem.
__label__pl	Tylko to ma dla mnie znaczenie.
__label__pl	Dla mnie tylko to jest ważne.
__label__pl	Przedterminowe wybory są często katastrofalne w skutkach dla ugrupowań będących u władzy.
__label__pl	Tom zatwierdził.
__label__pl	Tom zaakceptował.
__label__pl	Podejdź trochę bliżej.
__label__pl	Mam trzech braci i dwie siostry.
__label__pl	Kawa była bardzo gorąca.
__label__pl	Nie mogę skontaktować się z moimi krewnymi.
__label__pl	Byłbyś świetnym ojcem.
__label__pl	Przesuń, aby odblokować.
__label__pl	Nie możesz tego zrobić bez pozwolenia
__label__pl	Ptak nie wrócił
__label__pl	Weż co potrzebujesz i daj co chesz.
__label__pl	Pomoaganie innym nigdy nie jest stratą czasu.
__label__pl	Tom kocha tą piosenkę.
__label__pl	Słowa są ważne.
__label__pl	Prawdopodobnie dzisiaj będzie padać deszcz.
__label__pl	Woda jest tu płytka.
__label__pl	Przeskoczył płytki rów.
__label__pl	Jesteś powierzchowny i materialistyczny.
__label__pl	Woda jest tu bardzo płytka.
__label__pl	Róże mają kolce na łodygach.
__label__pl	Róża ma kolce na łodydze.
__label__pl	Wziął udział w ankiecie online.
__label__pl	Stał na wzgórzu, badając krajobraz.
__label__pl	Młoda para rozejrzała się po pokoju.
__label__pl	Zakazuję ci palić!
__label__pl	Zakazuję ci palić.
__label__pl	Prawo zakazuje budowania na tej ziemi jakiegokolwiek wieżowca.
__label__pl	Tom siedzi pod drzewem.
__label__pl	Nie przystaje mu powiedzieć coś takiego.
__label__pl	Naturalna woda mineralna zawiera wapń, magnez, sód, potas, a także azotan.
__label__pl	Sód jest jednym z najobficiej występujących pierwiastków w skorupie ziemskiej.
__label__pl	Nie wiem czy wiem wszystko wiem że nie wiem wystarczająco.
__label__pl	To że dostałeś złą ocenę nie znaczy że jesteś słaby to znaczy że za mało czasu się przygotowywałeś.
__label__pl	W dzisiejszych czasach wszyscy nosimy maski, a Ci którzy odważą się je zdjąć zostają odtrąceni.
__label__pl	Nie było mi łatwo napisać ten list po francusku.
__label__pl	Tego się bał.
__label__pl	O to się niepokoił.
__label__pl	Nie chcę, żeby ci goście mnie ścigali.
__label__pl	Cóż, nigdy tego nie wiedziałam.
__label__pl	Nie potrzebują nas.
__label__pl	Zerwaliśmy z nimi relacje.
__label__pl	Zerwałyśmy z nimi relacje.
__label__pl	Nie chcesz pójść z nami?
__label__pl	Tom waży około 80 kilogramów.
__label__pl	Tom waży około 80 kilo.
__label__pl	Nie pozwól swoim dzieciom pływać w tej rzece.
__label__pl	Nudziło mi się, więc wędrowałam po mieście.
__label__pl	Nudziło mi się, więc wędrowałem po mieście.
__label__pl	Może po prostu zawędruję sobie samej.
__label__pl	Może po prostu zawędruję sobie samemu.
__label__pl	Nie odchodź od tematu.
__label__pl	Miałem trochę wolnego czasu, więc posnułem się po mieście.
__label__pl	Miałam trochę wolnego czasu, więc posnułam się po mieście.
__label__pl	Tom musi wziąć się w garść.
__label__pl	Mocno uchwycił rakietę tenisową.
__label__pl	Mocno chwycił rakietę tenisową.
__label__pl	Mocno schwycił rakietę tenisową.
__label__pl	Oficer uchwycił go za ramię.
__label__pl	Jeden węch tego czegoś wystarczył, abym dostała nudności.
__label__pl	Psy wywęszają niebezpieczeństwo.
__label__pl	Mój poduszkowiec jest pełen węgorzy.
__label__pl	Musisz być głupcem.
__label__pl	Z reguły grad pada latem.
__label__pl	Nie ma potrzeby przywoływać taksówki.
__label__pl	Okrzyknięto go ojcem współczesnej antropologii.
__label__pl	Witaj, Cesarze, ci, którzy mają umrzeć, witają Cię!
__label__pl	Proszę Pana, czy ma Pan świadomość, że Pan jest kotem?
__label__pl	Nie rozmawiamy o Tomie.
__label__pl	Przepraszam, nie mogę tego zjeść - jestem diabetykiem.
__label__pl	Przepraszam, nie mogę tego zjeść - jestem diabetyczką.
__label__pl	Czy masz alergię na którykolwiek z tych składników?
__label__pl	Czy jesteś uczulona na którykolwiek z tych składników?
__label__pl	Nie spuść swoich dzieci z oczu.
__label__pl	Czy masz rodzinę lub znajomych, u których mogłabyś zostać?
__label__pl	Jak daleko jest granica?
__label__pl	Jak mogę dostać się do granicy?
__label__pl	Chcemy ubiegać się o specjalną wizę, aby tu pozostać.
__label__pl	Zostałam oddzielona od reszty mojej rodziny.
__label__pl	Moje dziecko ciągle kaszle i kicha.
__label__pl	Jakie są najnowsze wieści z Ukrainy?
__label__pl	Gdzie możemy usiąść?
__label__pl	Nie rozmawiajmy o Tomie.
__label__pl	Potknęłam się, ale nie upadłam.
__label__pl	Została pielęgniarką.
__label__pl	Wyjaśnij mi zasady.
__label__pl	Nie wydaje mi się, aby chciał ustatkować się ze mną.
__label__pl	Jakoś sobie poradzimy.
__label__pl	Kiedy przestaniesz spiskować?
__label__pl	Moim marzeniem jest studiować ukraiński w Kijowie.
__label__pl	Nie chce być kowbojem.
__label__pl	Matka połaskotała swoje dziecko piórkiem.
__label__pl	Dosyć dziwne.
__label__pl	Znasz tę piosenkę?
__label__pl	Pierwszym krokiem jest zebranie informacji.
__label__pl	Nic mu nie powiedziałem.
__label__pl	Wygrał nagrodę w tym tygodniu.
__label__pl	Lina zerwała się pod napięciem.
__label__pl	Nie filtruję twojej herbaty.
__label__pl	Kontrolerzy ruchu lotniczego są pod ciężkim napięciem umysłowym.
__label__pl	Wysilałam się, aby usłyszeć, co powiedział prezydent.
__label__pl	Ten płyn nie odcedza się dobrze.
__label__pl	Śpiewał z napiętym głosem.
__label__pl	Atmosfera może stać się całkiem napięta.
__label__pl	Skrótem, impreza była wspaniała.
__label__pl	Krótko mówiąc, impreza była wspaniała.
__label__pl	Wysłał mi krótki list.
__label__pl	Majtki bokserskie to idealne połączenie bokserek i majtek.
__label__pl	To są moje slipy.
__label__pl	To są moje majtki.
__label__pl	Tom uwielbia piec tarty dyniowe.
__label__pl	Nie myślałam, że tak się zdenerwujesz.
__label__pl	Jazda rowerem po drodze wzdłóż otoczonej drzewami rzeki naprawdę poprawia humor.
__label__pl	Mogę też ją spytać czy nie chciałaby przyprowadzić swojego nowego chłopaka.
__label__pl	Tomowi potrzebna będzie moja pomoc.
__label__pl	Tom myślał, że Mary się na niego nie wkurzy.
__label__pl	Spotkałam raz dziecko.
__label__pl	Musimy naprawić swoje błędy.
__label__pl	Ospa znacząco pomniejszyła populację rdzennych Amerykanów.
__label__pl	Mogę powiedzieć to Tomowi?
__label__pl	Oni są wszyscy bosi.
__label__pl	Mary wypaliła papierosem dziurę w swoich spodniach.
__label__pl	Tom umie prowadzić?
__label__pl	Nie jestem do końca pewna, że Tom nam wierzy.
__label__pl	Ona musi mieć rację.
__label__pl	Cieszę się, że Tom pojechał.
__label__pl	Granica jest zamknięta na klucz.
__label__pl	Jestem gotów. Zrobię to, co należy.
__label__pl	Przyjechałam na czas.
__label__pl	Chodzę do cerkwi w niedzielę.
__label__pl	Jestem trzy lata od niego młodsza.
__label__pl	Czy u nich w domu jest telefon?
__label__pl	My z Tomem nie jesteśmy gotowi.
__label__pl	Pan nie może być lekarzem.
__label__pl	Całowałaś kiedyś którąkolwiek z nich?
__label__pl	Na śniegu są czyjeś ślady.
__label__pl	Nie spłukałoś toalety.
__label__pl	Samiego wysłano do tamtego domu.

__label__pl	Maria jest siostrą Toma.

__label__pl	Oni są policjantami.
__label__pl	Podniosła głowę.
__label__pl	Co było dziś na obiad?
__label__pl	Kto chce jeszcze zjeść ciasta?
__label__pl	Możesz to na chwileczkę potrzymać?

__label__pl	Kto ci dał tę książkę?
__label__pl	Jak to możliwe, że nie lubi pan oliwek?
__label__pl	Ten olej jest z oliwek.
__label__pl	On żeni się w sobotę.
__label__pl	Grecka kuchnia jest ciekawa.
__label__pl	Nie przypominam sobie, żebyśmy byli na ty.
__label__pl	Tom i Maria bardzo się kochają.
__label__pl	Gdzie odbywają się targi?
__label__pl	Będziecie na pewno bardzo zadowoleni.
__label__pl	Będziesz na pewno bardzo zadowolony.
__label__pl	Kto kocha bardziej, musi bardziej cierpieć.
__label__pl	Czy Emily ma zielone oczy?
__label__pl	Wiedziałem już to trzy godziny temu.
__label__pl	Muszę doczytać tę książkę do końca.
__label__pl	Ostatni bóg zmarł miliony lat temu.
__label__pl	Mówi się, że palenie szkodzi zdrowiu.
__label__pl	Hiszpański brzmi jak grecki.
__label__pl	Czy zastosowałeś się do jego rady?
__label__pl	Francja słynie z wina.
__label__pl	Zawsze się tak spieszysz.
__label__pl	Ten facet ma złote serce.
__label__pl	Czy on cię zaszantażował?
__label__pl	Co znalazł?
__label__pl	Im mniej języków tym lepiej.
__label__pl	Światło zapalało się i gasło.
__label__pl	Ziri strasznie się bał ciemności.
__label__pl	Natychmiast!
__label__pl	Już?!
__label__pl	Morderca!
__label__pl	Proszę!
__label__pl	Policja!
__label__pl	Alleluja!
__label__pl	Zakład?
__label__pl	Ciekawe!
__label__pl	Pozdrowienia!
__label__pl	Otwieraj!
__label__pl	Cukier.
__label__pl	Odpowiedz.
__label__pl	Odpowiadaj.
__label__pl	Pokój!
__label__pl	Litości!
__label__pl	Pij.
__label__pl	Leniuch!
__label__pl	Sprzedane!
__label__pl	Powoli!
__label__pl	Amen!
__label__pl	Zdrajca!
__label__pl	I?
__label__pl	Patrzcie!
__label__pl	Wsiadać!
__label__pl	Na dole.
__label__pl	Więcej.
__label__pl	Piszcie!
__label__pl	Idziemy?
__label__pl	Carlos zawrócił.
__label__pl	Bez wątpienia!
__label__pl	Prezent świąteczny.
__label__pl	Nie dotykać!
__label__pl	Przejścia nie ma!
__label__pl	Czapki z głów!
__label__pl	Więcej pracy?
__label__pl	Pożar! Uciekajcie!
__label__pl	Pokój dwuosobowy.
__label__pl	Tak, proszę!
__label__pl	On kłamie!
__label__pl	Ona kłamie!
__label__pl	Święta Bożego Narodzenia tuż tuż.
__label__pl	Zostaw ją.
__label__pl	Suni gra.
__label__pl	Suni bawi się.
__label__pl	Nie przeszkadzać!
__label__pl	Zakaz zawracania!
__label__pl	Jest przeciąg.
__label__pl	Za mną!
__label__pl	Ona kłamie.
__label__pl	Pomyłka!
__label__pl	Szerokiej drogi.
__label__pl	Palenie wzbronione!
__label__pl	Nigdy więcej.
__label__pl	Słowa, słowa...
__label__pl	Nie wychylać się.
__label__pl	Tom zagłodził się na śmierć.
__label__pl	Tom umarł z głodu.
__label__pl	Ona stoi.
__label__pl	Do diabła!
__label__pl	Tak, z przyjemnością!
__label__pl	Dziękuję, wzajemnie.
__label__pl	Biorę prysznic.
__label__pl	Tom biegnie.
__label__pl	Maria krzyczy.
__label__pl	Maria chrapie.
__label__pl	Płaczemy.
__label__pl	Modlę się.
__label__pl	Tom hamuje.
__label__pl	Ja hamuję.
__label__pl	Mów, proszę.
__label__pl	Nie teraz!
__label__pl	Co robić?
__label__pl	Co począć?
__label__pl	Wszędzie ścieżki rowerowe!
__label__pl	No, idź!
__label__pl	Czy on pracuje?
__label__pl	Wdech - wydech.
__label__pl	Mów wolniej!
__label__pl	Czy mężczyźni płaczą?
__label__pl	Bądź silny!
__label__pl	Milcz, proszę!
__label__pl	Maria klęczy.
__label__pl	Nie tutaj.
__label__pl	Czytam.
__label__pl	Nie tutaj!
__label__pl	Jedź ostrożnie!
__label__pl	Dzięki tobie.
__label__pl	Pocę się.
__label__pl	Tak, jasne!
__label__pl	Akurat!
__label__pl	"Wiek?" "16."
__label__pl	Super bryka!
__label__pl	Zostań tu!
__label__pl	Odpowiedz mi!
__label__pl	Pościłem.
__label__pl	Żałowałem.
__label__pl	Cierpiałem.
__label__pl	Odpowiedziałem.
__label__pl	Ilu Turków mieszka w Grecji?
__label__pl	Ładny krawat!
__label__pl	Tom zaspał i przegapił ważne spotkanie z klientką.
__label__pl	Tom zaspał i przegapił ważne spotkanie z klientem.
__label__pl	Nie ułatwiaj mu!
__label__pl	Potrzebuję po prostu trochę czasu dla siebie.
__label__pl	Francuzi mówią bardzo szybko.
__label__pl	Nie pije pan kawy?
__label__pl	Nie pijecie kawy?
__label__pl	Nie pijesz kawy?
__label__pl	Maria nam pomogła.
__label__pl	Maliny są bardzo drogie.
__label__pl	Co by pan zrobił na Toma miejscu?
__label__pl	Gdzie jest jej kapelusz?
__label__pl	Jestem pewny, że nadal jesteś w nim zakochana.
__label__pl	Ogień jest gorący.
__label__pl	Po co ci nowy telewizor?
__label__pl	Tu i teraz masz ku temu okazję.
__label__pl	Nie jestem właścicielką.
__label__pl	"Tom się prawdopodobnie spóźni." - "Tak, to całkiem możliwe."
__label__pl	Wcale nie chcę mieć żadnego zawodu. Wyjdę bogato za mąż.
__label__pl	Najbliższe cztery tygodnie będą decydujące.
__label__pl	Zadzwoniliście do niego wczoraj?
__label__pl	Drzwi były uchylone.
__label__pl	Jestem tu od soboty.
__label__pl	Myślisz, że sam wykonał pracę?
__label__pl	Wszyscy mają zły humor.
__label__pl	Nie rozumiem, dlaczego tak nagle poszedł.
__label__pl	Dobrze, wystarczy.
__label__pl	Gdzie leży Estonia?
__label__pl	Pięć lat temu odkleiła mi się siatkówka.
__label__pl	Poszedłbyś zamiast mnie?
__label__pl	Strasznie wyglądasz.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział mi, że wie, gdzie mieszka Maria.
__label__pl	Do którego gimnazjum idziesz?
__label__pl	Jesteś przecież jeszcze taki młody!
__label__pl	Jest smakoszem.
__label__pl	Stanąłem obok niego.
__label__pl	Odbierz, proszę, telefon.
__label__pl	Wtedy wydawało mi się to całkiem normalne.
__label__pl	Ona ma podwójny podbródek.
__label__pl	Może wygrasz, a może nie.
__label__pl	Tom nawet nie wie, jak się nazywasz.
__label__pl	Czy to wszystko, co zostało?
__label__pl	Niestety to wszystko, co zostało.
__label__pl	Dni mijają.
__label__pl	Zabierz zeszyt.
__label__pl	Było tam dużo do jedzenia.
__label__pl	Ciężko uwierzyć, że to się naprawdę stało.
__label__pl	Żona mojego wnuka jest Rosjanką.
__label__pl	Matka mojego prawnuka jest Rosjanką.
__label__pl	On ciągle do mnie dzwoni.
__label__pl	Ryż przywiozłem z Chin.
__label__pl	Przywiozłem ci ryż z Chin.
__label__pl	"Wydaje mi się, że jesteśmy na miejscu." - "To ten dom?"
__label__pl	Że też ten cholerny pies zawsze szczeka!
__label__pl	Jeśli coś nie istnieje, to wynajdę to.
__label__pl	Wiedziałeś, że masz ładne oczy?
__label__pl	W Europie to całkiem normalne.
__label__pl	Jeszcze nigdy nie straciłem przytomności.
__label__pl	Będzie pan z pewnością bardzo zadowolony.
__label__pl	Cóż, tak nawet myślałem, ale nagle ogarnęły mnie wątpliwości.
__label__pl	Łączę się z tobą w bólu.
__label__pl	Tę książkę napisano dla dzieci.
__label__pl	Ta książka została napisana dla dzieci.
__label__pl	To mieszkanie nie jest na sprzedaż.
__label__pl	Bardzo dobrze mówicie po niemiecku.
__label__pl	Nie wiem, gdzie jestem; czy może mi pan pomóc?
__label__pl	Może byś wstał i przeszedł się kawałek?
__label__pl	W pokoju jest zimno.
__label__pl	Tom stracił pracę i jest bardzo zadłużony.
__label__pl	Kochałam go - i nadal go kocham.
__label__pl	Wydaje mi się, że u Ritterów są włamywacze. Musimy zadzwonić na policję,
__label__pl	W tym kolorze włosów wyglądasz jak pisklę. To nie blond, ale żółty.
__label__pl	Powinieneś pójść na spacer. To uspokaja.
__label__pl	Kto krzyczy, nigdy nie ma racji.
__label__pl	Nie powinieneś na niego krzyczeć.
__label__pl	Nauczyłem cię czytać i pisać, a co z ciebie wyrosło? Złodziej! Gdyby tylko nasza matka o tym wiedziała!
__label__pl	Pan mówi bardzo dobrze po niemiecku.
__label__pl	Czy poza tym to zdanie jest poprawne?
__label__pl	Tylko tak to powiedziałem.
__label__pl	Tom zawsze tak robi.
__label__pl	Maj jest młodością, miłością, śpiewem i wszystkim, co w życiu jest piękne.
__label__pl	Kot znika, gdy widzi psa.
__label__pl	Zabawki są schowane w czerwonej skrzynce.
__label__pl	Gdy na siebie patrzymy, wiemy, co czujemy.
__label__pl	Patrzą na siebie, ale nie rozmawiają.
__label__pl	Nie wiedziałem, że jest chora.
__label__pl	Serwer padł.
__label__pl	Jak pierze się wełnianą odzież?
__label__pl	Chowasz się przede mną? Dlaczego?
__label__pl	Matma to nic dla mnie; wolę iść na dwór, żeby grać w piłkę nożną.
__label__pl	Kochałem ją - i nadal ją kocham.
__label__pl	Tom i Maria są uzależnieni od leków.
__label__pl	Najbardziej boli mnie, że mnie okłamałeś.
__label__pl	Spojrzałem na nią, a ona na mnie.
__label__pl	Popatrzyłem na nią, a ona na mnie.
__label__pl	Widziałem, jak na siebie spojrzeliście.
__label__pl	Widziałem, jak na siebie patrzyliście.
__label__pl	Pobrali się w Kanadzie.
__label__pl	Wzięli ślub w Kanadzie.
__label__pl	Ożenił się z cudzoziemką.
__label__pl	Bardzo dobrze mówisz po niemiecku.
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie możecie jej powiedzieć, że ją kochacie?
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie może jej pan powiedzieć, że ją pan kocha?
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie możesz jej powiedzieć, że ją kochasz?
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie może mu pan powiedzieć, że go pan kocha?
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie możesz mu powiedzieć, że go kochasz?
__label__pl	Opony są zużyte.
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie mogę być tobą?
__label__pl	Jest mi wszystko jedno, czy idziecie, czy nie.
__label__pl	Jest mi wszystko jedno, czy pan idzie, czy nie.
__label__pl	Jest mi wszystko jedno, czy idziesz, czy nie.
__label__pl	Samochód Toma stoi na zewnątrz.
__label__pl	Panie i panowie, dobry wieczór!
__label__pl	Co tu robisz, młody człowieku?
__label__pl	Nikt nie odrabiał za mnie lekcji.
__label__pl	Zaproponowałem jej pomoc w tłumaczeniu.
__label__pl	Mój kot zjadł mysz.
__label__pl	Ile miodu mam kupić?
__label__pl	Jem frytki.
__label__pl	Ta sytuacja jest dla nas obojga nieprzyjemna.
__label__pl	Nie czytam żadnej gazety.
__label__pl	"Jest atrakcyjna i ma poczucie humoru!" - "A umie gotować?" - "Kogo to obchodzi?"
__label__pl	No, to jesteśmy.
__label__pl	Już niedługo Święta Bożego Narodzenia.
__label__pl	Próbuję zapamiętać nazwy gwiazdozbiorów.
__label__pl	Nie uważasz, że tata mówi jak babcia?
__label__pl	W moim winie pływają muszki owocówki.
__label__pl	Mój ojciec jest szefem.
__label__pl	Zapomniałem się uczesać,
__label__pl	Farbuję sobie włosy na czarno.
__label__pl	Kto pana wpuścił?
__label__pl	Dlaczego, do cholery, wróciłeś?
__label__pl	Dobrze zamknąłeś okno?
__label__pl	Szczęście jest zdrowiem duszy.
__label__pl	Dziękuję, ale sam sobie poradzę.
__label__pl	Dziękuję, ale sam sobie dam radę.
__label__pl	Chciałem usłyszeć twój głos.
__label__pl	W Niemczech jest wiele zamków.
__label__pl	Na świecie są dwa typy ludzi: ci, którzy dokonują wielkich rzeczy, i ci, którzy dostają za to chwałę. Staraj się być tym pierwszym. Jest mniejsza konkurencja.
__label__pl	Jeśli nie masz nic miłego do powiedzenia, nie mów nic.
__label__pl	Jeżeli nie masz nic miłego do powiedzenia, to w ogóle nic nie mów.
__label__pl	Chcę, żebyś zastanowił się nad tym, co jest dla ciebie naprawdę ważne.
__label__pl	Zgubiliśmy Jima w tłumie.
__label__pl	Czy jest lekarz na pokładzie statku?
__label__pl	Ona ma więcej niż czterdzieści lat.
__label__pl	Tom został zabity przez ogromnego szerszenia.
__label__pl	Następnego dnia przyjechał Tom.
__label__pl	Toma wypuszczono z więzienia dwudziestego października.
__label__pl	Tom popatrzył na Mary i uśmiechnął się.
__label__pl	Nie jestem ślepa.
__label__pl	Dlaczego przestała mi odpowiadać?
__label__pl	Mamy prawie wszystko gotowe.
__label__pl	Jakiego koloru są jej oczy?
__label__pl	Gra na pianinie jak maestro.
__label__pl	Listopad to zdecydowanie najlepszy miesiąc na podróż do Japonii.
__label__pl	Hiszpania leży na zachód od Grecji.
__label__pl	Turcja leży na wschód od Grecji.
__label__pl	Przywiozłem kiełbaski z Niemiec.
__label__pl	Nawet nie jestem pewny, czy to się tak po niemiecku nazywa.
__label__pl	Czy mi pan kiedykolwiek wybaczy?
__label__pl	To głupie pytanie.
__label__pl	Byli silni.
__label__pl	Koniec tego dobrego! Przebrała się miarka!
__label__pl	Na dworze ktoś grabi liście.
__label__pl	Pójdę zobaczyć, co oni tam robią.
__label__pl	Chce Pan zarabiać dużo pieniędzy?
__label__pl	Chce Pan zarobić dużo pieniędzy?
__label__pl	Co powinno być w apteczce domowej?
__label__pl	Peter lubi wieczorem wypić piwo.
__label__pl	Najbardziej lubię pić wodę mineralną.
__label__pl	Czy dobrze zakładam, że żałujesz tego?
__label__pl	Kupiłem dzieciom dwa czekoladowe mikołaje.
__label__pl	To jest takie malusieńkie, że prawie nie mogę tego złapać.
__label__pl	Niech pan nie myśli o słoniu!
__label__pl	W okularach też tego nie widzę.
__label__pl	To jest takie malutkie, że ledwo to widzę.
__label__pl	Dlaczego on się ubiera na czarno?
__label__pl	"To cholernie dużo pieniędzy!" - "To? Tyle to ja przepuszczam w jeden weekend."
__label__pl	Anna ma babcię Rosjankę; stąd mówi trochę po rosyjsku.
__label__pl	Nie wolno im wierzyć.
__label__pl	Tom ma bardzo gruby brzuch.
__label__pl	Nigdy nie mam przy sobie gotówki.
__label__pl	Kiedy w Rosji są Święta Bożego Narodzenia?
__label__pl	Pytanie tylko, czy chcesz pracować, czy zarabiać.
__label__pl	Tylko wykorzystałem możliwości.
__label__pl	Nie można im wierzyć.
__label__pl	Nie chcemy wchodzić.
__label__pl	Partia rządząca nie ma właściwie żadnego programu.
__label__pl	Gotówka oznacza wolność.
__label__pl	Niestety jestem na służbie. Nie wolno mi tego zrobić.
__label__pl	Nie zastanawiaj się za długo, bo sprzedam to komuś innemu!
__label__pl	Po prostu piszę, co mi przychodzi do głowy.
__label__pl	Jeśli jesteś mądry, możesz te pieniądze zarobić w ciągu tygodnia.
__label__pl	Chciałbym zamienić kika słów z kasjerami.
__label__pl	Gdzie jest północna część miasta?
__label__pl	WHO działa jak firma.
__label__pl	On mówi o sobie.
__label__pl	Spekulanci to po prostu złodzieje.
__label__pl	Chcesz zarabiać dużo pieniędzy?
__label__pl	Chcesz zarobić dużo pieniędzy?
__label__pl	Nie wejdziecie?
__label__pl	Nie wchodzicie?
__label__pl	Prawdopodobnie możemy wejść tylko tylnymi drzwiami.
__label__pl	Słomki z papieru zapakowane w plastik są przyjazne dla środowiska.
__label__pl	Owce milczą.
__label__pl	Nie zawahałem się ani chwili.
__label__pl	Nie ma co się martwić! Wcześniej czy później ona się opanuje.
__label__pl	Maria wniosła herbatę i ciasto.
__label__pl	Pociąg odjeżdża z dworca.
__label__pl	Wariant koronawirusa B117 został już odkryty w Kalifornii, Kolorado i na Florydzie oraz w 30 innych krajach.
__label__pl	Śpiewam podczas kąpieli.
__label__pl	Przybiegł na spotkanie.
__label__pl	Wiele osób uważa łacinę za martwy język.
__label__pl	Odpowiada twierdząco.
__label__pl	Tom i Maria przeczytali razem książkę.
__label__pl	Tom i Maria czytali razem książkę.
__label__pl	Tom chce podróżować i poznawać ludzi z całego świata.
__label__pl	"Ach, jestem przeszczęśliwy" krzyknął do syrenki.
__label__pl	Wszystkie dzieci przybyły na dożynki do domu.
__label__pl	Pies stoi koło stołu i patrzy na jedzenie.
__label__pl	Mam dość twojego narzekania!
__label__pl	Przyszedł tu na piechotę.
__label__pl	"Tom robi śniadanie." - "Mamy dzwonić po straż pożarną?"
__label__pl	Wtedy byliśmy razem.
__label__pl	Odpowiedziała nam po angielsku.
__label__pl	Nie pozwolą jej uciec.
__label__pl	Nie dadzą jej uciec.
__label__pl	Odważna jest, prawda?
__label__pl	Odważna jest, co?
__label__pl	Uważam, że Tom to dobry sąsiad.
__label__pl	Naklejki na spodzie mojego laptopa starły się.
__label__pl	Skoro i tak się wałęsasz po kuchni, to weź wyłącz piekarnik.
__label__pl	Mary jest uwielbiana przez ludzi.
__label__pl	Zastanawiała się, czy kiedykolwiek zdobędzie się na odwagę, by ją pocałować.
__label__pl	Zazdrościła szczęścia jej sąsiada.
__label__pl	Była zazdrosna o szczęście sąsiada.
__label__pl	Zamknij się, Albert, twoja teoria jest do bani.
__label__pl	Gad chce być na pagórku.
__label__pl	Czemu mnie chwalicie? To ona na to wpadła!
__label__pl	Dlaczego chwalicie mnie? Ona to wymyśliła!
__label__pl	Tom uczy się.
__label__pl	Tom uśmiecha się.
__label__pl	Tom klęczy.
__label__pl	Tom walczy.
__label__pl	Nie do końca rozumie, co mówią młodzi ludzie.
__label__pl	Ty też?
__label__pl	Nie pojmuje całkiem, co mówi młodzież.
__label__pl	Tak. Chętnie!
__label__pl	Nie przerywaj.
__label__pl	Tom studiuje.
__label__pl	Tom gra.
__label__pl	Tom siedzi.
__label__pl	Do zobaczenia zaraz!
__label__pl	Do usłyszenia zaraz!
__label__pl	Pada śnieg?
__label__pl	Nie zapomnij!
__label__pl	Proszę, zostań!
__label__pl	Czy Tom śpiewa?
__label__pl	Stephen zmarł.
__label__pl	Stephen umarł.
__label__pl	Biedne dziecko!
__label__pl	Zahamowała.
__label__pl	Wydmuchaj nos.
__label__pl	Sok pomarańczowy, proszę.
__label__pl	Ty szczęściarzu!
__label__pl	Wątpisz.
__label__pl	No, wreszcie!
__label__pl	No, nareszcie!
__label__pl	Nie siorb!
__label__pl	Biedne dzieci!
__label__pl	Oni studiują.
__label__pl	Nazywam się...
__label__pl	Dzięki, bracie!
__label__pl	Wierz mi!
__label__pl	Zaczyna się.
__label__pl	Prawdopodobnie dlatego.
__label__pl	Niewielu, jeśli w ogóle, Amerykanów pojęło znaczenie tego, co zostało osiągnięte.
__label__pl	Tom ogarnia gramatykę, ale jest słaby co do ortografii.
__label__pl	Tom ma dobrą znajomość gramatyki, ale jest kiepski w pisowni.
__label__pl	Nie musicie mi pomagać.
__label__pl	Ta gra została przełożona.
__label__pl	Otrzymałem listy.
__label__pl	Jesteś w pobliżu?
__label__pl	Nadal nie śpisz? Pora spać!
__label__pl	Moja pierwsza randka była w lodziarni.
__label__pl	Nie chcę taki być.
__label__pl	Nie możesz tak na mnie krzyczeć.
__label__pl	Kocham jeże.
__label__pl	Wznieśmy kieliszki za zdrowie naszego ojca!
__label__pl	Której z tych książek jeszcze nie czytałeś?
__label__pl	Czerwone wino dobrze wpływa na zdrowie, jego tajemnica tkwi w dawkowaniu.
__label__pl	Czy możesz, proszę, otworzyć okno?
__label__pl	Chciałbym przyjść na twoją imprezę.
__label__pl	Tom jest niezwykle romantyczny.
__label__pl	Nie powinniśmy tracić odwagi.
__label__pl	Marii nie podoba się ta zabawa.
__label__pl	Marii nie podoba się ta gra.
__label__pl	Zaczął boleć mnie brzuch po zjedzeniu loda.
__label__pl	Moje dziecko, czego się lękasz?
__label__pl	Moi rodzice pozwalają mi wyjechać za granicę.
__label__pl	Nie chcę loda.
__label__pl	Jest jesień i liście lecą z drzew.
__label__pl	Przepraszam, czy coś powiedzieliście?
__label__pl	Przypominam sobie, że już ten film widziałem.
__label__pl	Nie złamię mojej obietnicy.
__label__pl	Robię to tylko z przymusu.
__label__pl	Dlaczego nigdy nie podejmujesz się nieprzyjemnych prac?
__label__pl	Staram się być oszczędnym.
__label__pl	Nie jestem już małą dziewczynką.
__label__pl	"Jeśli nie przestaniesz palić, zrywam", powiedziała mi. Według mnie brzmi to jak ultimatum.
__label__pl	Nie mów tak głośno.
__label__pl	"Czy on jeszcze pracuje?" - "Nie, jest już na emeryturze."
__label__pl	Życie, które składa się tylko z samotności, jest koszmarem.
__label__pl	Uśmiecham się do tej dziewczynki.
__label__pl	Możliwe, że miała rację.
__label__pl	Kobieta, którą kochałem, nigdy mnie nie kochała.
__label__pl	Ona mnie nigdy nie kochała.
__label__pl	Powiedziano mi, że mam tu już nie parkować.
__label__pl	Wiesz, jak wygląda córka Marii?" - "Oczywiście. Pokazała mi jej zdjęcie."
__label__pl	Czy oni mają dzieci?
__label__pl	Dodałem trochę mleka i jajka.
__label__pl	On nie znał tej dziewczyny.
__label__pl	Prezent jej się nie spodobał.
__label__pl	Ten szampon jest dobrej jakości.
__label__pl	Moich rodziców nie było wczoraj w domu.
__label__pl	Nikt z nas nie wie, co nas czeka.
__label__pl	Idziemy do domu, jak tylko przestanie padać.
__label__pl	Pokazała mi swoje zdjęcie.
__label__pl	Tom spojrzał przez wizjer, ale nikogo nie zobaczył.
__label__pl	Ta książka została sfilmowana.
__label__pl	Bądź koniecznie punktualnie!
__label__pl	Gdzie jest ten dom?
__label__pl	Angielski klimat jest łagodniejszy od szkockiego.
__label__pl	Znalazłem klucz w kieszeni jego kurtki.
__label__pl	On nie może się dowiedzieć, że tu jestem.
__label__pl	Tom tęsknił za swoją żoną Marią i za dziećmi.
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie kupił pan gitary?
__label__pl	Wiem, że masz romans.
__label__pl	Tom i Maria byli zafascynowani płatkami śniegu.
__label__pl	Wszyscy chcą pójść do nieba, ale nikt nie chce umrzeć.
__label__pl	Tom nosi maskę, również gdy sam siedzi w samochodzie.
__label__pl	Saloniki znajdują się pięćset kilometrów od Aten.
__label__pl	Postawił wszystko na jedną kartę i wszystko stracił.
__label__pl	Nadal jest matką moich dzieci.
__label__pl	Nie wierzycie mi, co?
__label__pl	NIgdy nie pytał, skąd ona jest.
__label__pl	Meble mogę sam złożyć.
__label__pl	Na stole leży kilka jabłek.
__label__pl	To dla mnie bardzo proste.
__label__pl	To dla mnie bardzo łatwe.
__label__pl	Możemy się razem napić herbaty?
__label__pl	To duży komplement.
__label__pl	Cieszę się, że się wreszcie spotkamy.
__label__pl	Cieszę się, że się wreszcie spotykamy.
__label__pl	Anna uczy w gimnazjum rosyjskiego i matematyki.
__label__pl	Omówiliśmy obszernie ten temat.
__label__pl	Te listy są nieczytelne.
__label__pl	Czy wie pan, gdzie leży ta wyspa?
__label__pl	To nikogo nie przekonało.
__label__pl	Tom śpiewa w chórkach.
__label__pl	Połóż je obok moich.
__label__pl	Moja dziewczyna jest ładna.
__label__pl	Źle się wyraziłem.
__label__pl	Czy są tu wasze dzieci?
__label__pl	Dlaczego jesteście tacy głupi?
__label__pl	Ty to tutaj narysowałeś?
__label__pl	Tom jest jak wielki pluszowy miś.
__label__pl	Spieszysz się dokądś?
__label__pl	Pierwszy raz w życiu odmawiam jedzenia.
__label__pl	Inni też to powiedzieli.
__label__pl	Czy kupiłabyś samochód, który rozpyla kojące aromaty, gdy stoisz w korku w godzinach szczytu?
__label__pl	Rozłączyła się i skierowała się do kuchni.
__label__pl	Gdy bawię się z moją kocicą, skąd mam wiedzieć, że to ona mnie zabawia, a nie ja ją?
__label__pl	Zaczęła śpiewać swoją ulubioną piosenkę, a on się z nią zharmonizował.
__label__pl	Nie ma doświadczenia w pisaniu na klawiaturze ani nie interesuje jej ta umiejętność.
__label__pl	Gdy w końcu zdecydowała się wystąpić na scenie, publiczność przywitała ją gwizdami.
__label__pl	Ledwo weszła do wanny, kiedy listonosz zadzwonił do jej drzwi, niosąc paczkę.
__label__pl	Jebać wszystko.
__label__pl	Pieprzyć wszystko.
__label__pl	Słyszę psa.
__label__pl	Otrzymałem wasz prezent.
__label__pl	Otrzymałem wasz podarunek.
__label__pl	Maria zarzuciła Tomowi ręce na szyję i pocałowała go.
__label__pl	Nie wierzcie we wszystko, co widzicie!
__label__pl	Niech pan nie wierzy we wszystko, co pan widzi!
__label__pl	Nie może pan jechać szybciej?
__label__pl	Nie możesz szybciej jechać?
__label__pl	Otrzymałem twój prezent.
__label__pl	Niemal codziennie pije piwo bezalkoholowe, bo piwo jest jej ulubionym napojem, ale nie chce codziennie pić alkoholu.
__label__pl	Nie obchodzi mnie, czy jest katoliczką, buddystką czy muzułmanką. Zależy mi tylko na jej przyjaźni.
__label__pl	Nasza kotka jest bardzo łobuzerska. Najpierw prosi o jedzenie. Potem, kiedy jej to damy, wącha, prycha, bierze jeden kęs i idzie sobie.
__label__pl	W Atenach kupiłem papugę, która mówi tylko po grecku.
__label__pl	Wyjaśnisz to po ludzku?
__label__pl	Mężczyzna, którego skrycie kochałam, nawet mnie nie zauważył.
__label__pl	Mężczyzna, którego potajemnie kochałem, nawet mnie nie dostrzegł.
__label__pl	Przeszliśmy już większość drogi.
__label__pl	Powiedz mi, co robiłeś w Tokio.
__label__pl	Stanowiła zagrożenie dla samej siebie, jak i reszty rodziny.
__label__pl	Ledwo otworzyła drzwi, a z domu wybiegł biały pies.
__label__pl	Gdy tylko otworzyła drzwi, z domu wybiegł biały pies.
__label__pl	Jestem zadowolony z tego wyniku.
__label__pl	Maria ma nogi gładkie jak jedwab.
__label__pl	Wszystko co dobre przydarza się, gdy się oczekuje tego najmniej.
__label__pl	Tom nie chciał zniszczyć przyjaźni.
__label__pl	Ostatnio spędzają ze sobą dużo więcej czasu.
__label__pl	Tom czuł, że coś jest nie tak.
__label__pl	Nikt nie jest właścicielem księżyca.
__label__pl	Ma na sobie swój zielony kostium kąpielowy z dziurą wokół pępka.
__label__pl	Wciąż jest twoja kolejka.
__label__pl	Pociąg będzie tu za chwilę.
__label__pl	Wciąż jest twoja kolej.
__label__pl	Każdy ma swoją cenę, ważne jest, by ustalić jaką.
__label__pl	Twarda z niego sztuka.
__label__pl	Czy warto iść na ten film?
__label__pl	Wiele rzeczy zmieniło się, wiesz.
__label__pl	Nie jesteście chorzy.
__label__pl	Poczekaj chwilkę! Nie odkładaj słuchawki!
__label__pl	Początek jesieni jest w październiku.
__label__pl	Wytłumacz to tak, żeby można było zrozumieć!
__label__pl	Poszła jakiś czas temu.
__label__pl	Tom próbował, ale mu się nie udało.
__label__pl	Czy mój kocur mnie kocha?
__label__pl	Czy mój kot mnie kocha?
__label__pl	Na dworze jest kotek.
__label__pl	Mój przyjaciel mówi po chińsku i po japońsku
__label__pl	W Bostonie pada śnieg?
__label__pl	Tom i Mary mieli dużo czasu, aby porozmawiać.
__label__pl	To zajmie pięć sekund.
__label__pl	To zajmie chwileczkę.
__label__pl	Chcę, żeby znała prawdę.
__label__pl	W jakiej skali jest ta mapa?
__label__pl	Najszybszym sposobem uzyskania prawidłowej informacji online jest zamieszczanie nieprawidłowej informacji.
__label__pl	Chcemy wiedzieć, co będziemy musieli zrobić, aby uzyskać wszystkie dokumenty.
__label__pl	I tak źle, i tak niedobrze.
__label__pl	Mary udawała, że pracuje na swoim komputerze, ale w rzeczywistości podsłuchiwała rozmowę.
__label__pl	Jeśli nie chcesz zranić jej uczuć, będziesz musiał trochę nagiąć prawdę.
__label__pl	Bardzo mi się podoba, co zrobiłeś z tym pokojem.
__label__pl	Tom przypalił ciastka.
__label__pl	Tom wyjął książkę z plecaka.
__label__pl	Tom wyjął sobie książkę z plecaka.
__label__pl	Będziecie potrzebować pomocy.
__label__pl	Będziesz potrzebować pomocy.
__label__pl	Tom nie zmienił po prostu miejsca pracy. Wyrzucili go.
__label__pl	Tom uczęszczał do renomowanej szkoły prywatnej.
__label__pl	Za tobą będę tęsknił najbardziej, Mario.
__label__pl	Moja córka nie jest już dzieckiem.
__label__pl	Jego córka nie jest już dzieckiem.
__label__pl	Czy mieszkaliście kiedykolwiek w Grecji?
__label__pl	Czy mieszkałeś kiedykolwiek w Grecji?
__label__pl	Czy mieszkał pan kiedykolwiek w Grecji?
__label__pl	Uczeń podniósł rękę i odpowiedział na pytanie.
__label__pl	Przeciągnęła nić przez ucho igielne i prędko zszyła rozdarcie.
__label__pl	Nie mamy nic lepszego do roboty.
__label__pl	Na stole kuchennym leży wczorajsza gazeta.
__label__pl	Już nie jestem tak dobry jak kiedyś.
__label__pl	Marzysz, by zostać milionerem.
__label__pl	Maria ma w pracy wielu przyjaciół.
__label__pl	Nauka języków obcych jest stratą czasu.
__label__pl	Jem loda.
__label__pl	Nie można kupić rzeczy, które są w życiu naprawdę ważne.
__label__pl	Nie słuchaj go! Tom cię okłamuje.
__label__pl	Tom przez pomyłkę wziął do domu Marii parasolkę.
__label__pl	Tom rzucił szkołę.
__label__pl	Mam nadzieję, że się uda.
__label__pl	"Gdzie jest mój telefon?" - "Na moim biurku."
__label__pl	Kto ci przekazał te informacje?
__label__pl	Przestań mi zawracać głowę! jestem zajęty.
__label__pl	Nie mogę piec chleba, bo nie mam piekarnika.
__label__pl	Nie idę do kościoła.
__label__pl	Toma jeszcze nigdy tu nie było.
__label__pl	Życie byłoby łatwiejsze, gdyby ludzie nie stwarzali tylu problemów.
__label__pl	Sprzedajesz owoce?
__label__pl	Było to lekkomyślne z mojej strony, zostawić włączony gaz.
__label__pl	Drzwi windy otworzyły się i wysiedliśmy.
__label__pl	Co w tym czasie nosiłem? Przypominasz sobie jeszcze?
__label__pl	Bardzo mi się to podobało.
__label__pl	Jestem Paul, twój współlokator.
__label__pl	Że on to wytrzymał ponad dziesięć lat, jest prawie cudem.
__label__pl	Mała staruszka udaremniła napad, waląc złodzieja w głowę laską.
__label__pl	Ptaki latają nisko nad naszym ogrodem.
__label__pl	Dobrze odpowiedziałem?
__label__pl	Zwykle pracuję rano.
__label__pl	Tom i Maria siedzieli pod drzewem.
__label__pl	To już tak dawno temu.
__label__pl	Tom spędza ze swoją rodziną bardzo mało czasu.
__label__pl	Maria przekręciła się na plecy.
__label__pl	Odwróć się i otwórz oczy!
__label__pl	Piękno bez dobra jest jak dom bez drzwi, statek bez wiatru lub źródło bez wody.
__label__pl	Co to za ser? On w ogóle nie ma dziur!
__label__pl	Chciałbym wiedzieć, czy pociąg jest punktualny.
__label__pl	Popatrz tylko, co znalazłem! Bursztyn!
__label__pl	Nasz pies jest mądrzejszy oder mnie.
__label__pl	Przyniosę coś do picia.
__label__pl	Róże pachną.
__label__pl	Czy wziąłem swoje leki?
__label__pl	Dziś w nocy o trzeciej zwymiotowałem.
__label__pl	O trzeciej w nocy zwymiotowałem.
__label__pl	Nigdy nie widziała, żeby się śmiał.
__label__pl	Po wojnie zakochali się w sobie, pobrali się i założyli rodzinę.
__label__pl	Nie zmuszaj się do robienia rzeczy, których nie lubisz.
__label__pl	Zbroja rycerza lśniła w słońcu.
__label__pl	W stodole znalazłem wychudzoną kozę jedzącą pokarm dla kurczaków.
__label__pl	Całkiem nieźle sobie radzę z nastawianiem ludziom kręgosłupów.
__label__pl	Nie przepraszaj za bycie ciekawym.
__label__pl	Nie przepraszaj za ciekawość.
__label__pl	Dość tej tajemniczej ciszy!
__label__pl	Czy wiesz, że jeśli podłączysz ogórek kiszony do gniazdka elektrycznego, zacznie świecić i brzęczeć?
__label__pl	"Lubisz szczupłych mężczyzn, czyż nie?" — "Lubię cię takiego, jaki jesteś."
__label__pl	"Co tam, Cookie?" "Miau." "Zawsze tak mówisz."
__label__pl	Co będzie, to będzie!
__label__pl	Nie spodziewałam się, że schudnę aż tyle.
__label__pl	Srogo na nas spojrzała, gdy zasugerowaliśmy, aby przeprosiła.
__label__pl	Rzuciła nam srogie spojrzenie, kiedy zasugerowałyśmy, by przeprosiła.
__label__pl	Z łatwością ukończyła egzamin praktyczny; nie wątpię, że zda, gdy będzie duża presja.
__label__pl	Słyszałam, jak otwiera drzwi i wchodzi.
__label__pl	"Każdy z nas był kiedyś dzieckiem." – "Nawet Nana?" – "Tak, nawet Nana." – "W to to nie wierzę!"
__label__pl	"Dlaczego wcześniej nam nie powiedziałaś, że musiałaś pójść?" "Byłam zbyt zawstydzona."
__label__pl	"Czemu nam wcześniej nie powiedziałeś, że musisz iść?" "Byłem zbyt zażenowany."
__label__pl	"Przepraszam, że pytam, ale czy jesteś Kanadyjczykiem?" "Tak, jestem. Skąd wiedziałaś?"
__label__pl	"Cześć Dawid, jak się dziś masz?" "Niedobrze, mój długopis jest w domu, jak i moja praca domowa i mój podręcznik."
__label__pl	Szkolny dzwonek dzwoni i zaczyna się dzień.
__label__pl	Tom cierpi.
__label__pl	"Boli mnie żołądek." "Dlaczego? Zjadłaś coś dziwnego?" "Nie mam pojęcia."
__label__pl	Daj mi trochę!
__label__pl	"Która godzina?" "Za piętnaście pierwsza." "Zafunduję ci lunch. Musisz być głodny." "Mam kanapki, które zrobiła mi żona."
__label__pl	"Przednia szyba Yanni'ego jest w okropnym stanie." "O co ci chodzi?" "Nie widziesz? Jest cała porysowana."
__label__pl	Mam pewność, że jego nauczyciel chemii by go oblał, gdyby przeżyli tragiczny wybuch.
__label__pl	Jestem pewna, że jego nauczycielka chemii by go oblał, gdyby przeżyli tragiczną eksplozję.
__label__pl	"Możecie naprawić pęknięcia w mojej przedniej szybie?" "Po to tu jesteśmy." "Dzięki Bogu."
__label__pl	"Chcesz tą pomarańczę?" "Nie, w ogóle nie chcę żadnej pomarańczy."
__label__pl	Pewne jest, że pomógł im dla własnej korzyści.
__label__pl	Jest pewne, że pomagał im dla własnego pożytku.
__label__pl	Nie wydaje się, aby pisarze, tacy jak powieściopisarze i poeci, odnosili wiele korzyści z postępu nauki.
__label__pl	Poszedł chory do pracy.
__label__pl	Ogrzałem się przed kominkiem.
__label__pl	Wysiedliśmy z windy.
__label__pl	To jest moja ulubiona księgarnia.
__label__pl	Nie mieliśmy dużo słońca tego lata.
__label__pl	Moja znajomość rosyjskiego pozostawia wiele do życzenia.
__label__pl	Rozmawiałem z nimi trzy dni temu.
__label__pl	I tak nikt nie słucha.
__label__pl	Niebo było przejrzyste.
__label__pl	Było ciepło, ale deszczowo.
__label__pl	Tom pozmywał.
__label__pl	Teraz twoja kolej, żeby coś powiedzieć.
__label__pl	Żadna praca nie jest prosta.
__label__pl	Książka, którą Tom napisał w esperanto, została przetłumaczona na wiele języków na całym świecie.
__label__pl	Jestem tam, gdzie ty.
__label__pl	Daję co mogę biednym dzieciom.
__label__pl	Nie mówię ci wszystkiego.
__label__pl	Ktoś znalazł na ulicy twój telefon komórkowy.
__label__pl	Widziałem chłopca w kolorowych butach.
__label__pl	Jest jeszcze otwarte.
__label__pl	Wiesz, czego się dowiedziałem?
__label__pl	Dopiero co przyszedłem.
__label__pl	Przyszedłem dopiero przed chwilą.
__label__pl	Podczas klasówki nauczyciel przyłapał jednego ucznia na ściąganiu.
__label__pl	"Czy ma pan coś tańszego?" - "Niestety nie. To jest najtańsze."
__label__pl	O siódmej będę wolny.
__label__pl	Jestem teraz zbyt zmęczony, żeby się z nim spotkać.
__label__pl	To są najlepsi.
__label__pl	Daliśmy z siebie wszystko.
__label__pl	Nie musimy.
__label__pl	Nie, kwiaty nie są zielone, lecz czerwone, białe, żółte lub niebieskie.
__label__pl	Spotykamy się jutro z Tomem.
__label__pl	Pokaż, co masz w torbie.
__label__pl	Pokaż, co masz w kieszeni.
__label__pl	Tom nie jest bardzo gruby.
__label__pl	Tom nie jest taki gruby.
__label__pl	Tom nie jest zbyt gruby.
__label__pl	Tom jest naszym sąsiadem.
__label__pl	Jesteście piękną parą.
__label__pl	Ptaki są czerwone.
__label__pl	Mój poziom cholesterolu jest wysoki.
__label__pl	Chmura to masa pary.
__label__pl	Czy myślisz o dziewczynie, którą widziałeś wczoraj?
__label__pl	To chłopiec, którego ojciec jest lekarzem.
__label__pl	Gdzie są jabłka, które kupiłem?
__label__pl	Liczby zawsze będą dziwne dla toki pony.
__label__pl	Ktokolwiek mówi te rzeczy, nie wie, co mówi.
__label__pl	To jest list, który napisałem.
__label__pl	To jest zegarek, który kupiłem.
__label__pl	Możesz pisać, co tylko chcesz.
__label__pl	Mam osiemdziesiąt dziewięć lat.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy w dwudziestym drugim roku dwudziestego pierwszego wieku.
__label__pl	Jesteście młodzi i figlarni, a wszystko jest dla was łatwe.
__label__pl	Miała dobry pomysł.
__label__pl	Był jednym z moich najlepszych przyjaciół.
__label__pl	Maria jest inteligentną kobietą.
__label__pl	Uważam, że książka jest bardzo ciekawa.
__label__pl	Tomek to stary przyjaciel z mojej młodości.
__label__pl	Połóż czerwone jabłka tutaj, a zielone tam.
__label__pl	Prawo wchodzi w życie.
__label__pl	Siedziała tam bez słowa ponad godzinę.
__label__pl	Siedziała tam ponad godzinę, nie mówiąc ani słowa.
__label__pl	Powiedziała mi, że można wypożyczyć rower.
__label__pl	Życie to nie bajka.
__label__pl	Queiroz powiedział, że pogoda w Grecji jest dobra.
__label__pl	Nie wiem jeszcze czy dostanę jakieś gwiazdki.
__label__pl	Tom uczył się 27 języków, ale potrafi mówić tylko po angielsku, w swoim ojczystym języku.
__label__pl	Żaden system liczbowy nie może być zgodny z językiem toki pona.
__label__pl	O której godzinie odjeżdża autobus?
__label__pl	Juz wyszedłem.
__label__pl	Nie mogę znaleźć mojej walizki. Gdzie ją położyłeś?
__label__pl	Plac jest pełen rowerów.
__label__pl	Ile kosztuje podróż pociągiem?
__label__pl	Widzisz nieprzytomną osobę.
__label__pl	Nie można podróżować bez paszportu.
__label__pl	Statek odpływa o siódmej.
__label__pl	Potrzebuję mapy Grecji.
__label__pl	Możesz mnie zawieźć na lotnisko?
__label__pl	Angielski jest łatwiejszy niż grecki.
__label__pl	Im więcej pracuję, tym mniej śpię.
__label__pl	Im częściej cię widzę, tym bardziej cię kocham.
__label__pl	Dziś jest najlepszy dzień w moim życiu.
__label__pl	Przyjechał tak szybko, jak tylko mógł.
__label__pl	To najdroższa torebka, jaką kiedykolwiek kupiłam.
__label__pl	Wzdłuż alei znajduje się wiele drogich sklepów.
__label__pl	Jaka jest najpopularniejsza gazeta w twoim kraju?
__label__pl	Stacja metra znajduje się na placu.
__label__pl	Chodzenie jest lepsze niż siedzenie.
__label__pl	Kierowca zostawił samochód na chodniku.
__label__pl	Potrzebuję dwudziestu wydajnych pracowników.
__label__pl	Tata kupił mi duży żółty rower.
__label__pl	Aleja jest pełna sygnalizacji świetlnej.
__label__pl	Zostaw go gdziekolwiek chcesz.
__label__pl	Kobieta, która mówi, jest wysoka.
__label__pl	Mam cztery koty.
__label__pl	Kiedy jedziemy na motocyklu, musimy nosić kask.
__label__pl	To jest mój przyjaciel.
__label__pl	To jest moj kolega.
__label__pl	Na moje urodziny chciałbym iść sztukę.
__label__pl	Banany, jabłka i pomarańcze są wszystkie owocami.
__label__pl	Chcę znać jego wiek.
__label__pl	Chcę wiedzieć jaki jest jego wiek.
__label__pl	Ogól swoje wąsy.
__label__pl	To nie istotne jaką religię wyznajesz.
__label__pl	Mieszkam w Paryżu.
__label__pl	Jeśli nie znasz odpowiedzi, zgaduj.
__label__pl	Nie podchodź do tamtego psa.
__label__pl	Nie podchodź do tego psa.
__label__pl	Jeże mają kolce.
__label__pl	Tego ranka w moim piórze skończył się atrament.
__label__pl	Tego ranka skończył mi się atrament w piórze.
__label__pl	Możesz potrzymać jeże, gdy ich kolce są opuszczone, a nawet je pogłaskać.
__label__pl	Nasza rakieta jest budowana.
__label__pl	Ona przeczytała wszystkie książki o muminkach.
__label__pl	Fińska pisarka, mówiąca i pisząca po szwedzku, była twórczynią muminków - bajkowych stworków, które przypominają hipopotamy. Pierwsza książka o muminkach pojawiła się w 1945.
__label__pl	Kawa jest lepsza od herbaty od większości Greków.
__label__pl	Jem malinę.
__label__pl	Ona jest bardzo praktyczna, czyż nie?
__label__pl	Ona jest bardzo praktyczna, nie?
__label__pl	John odpalił samochód.
__label__pl	Dlaczego psy jedzą trawę?
__label__pl	Lubię spać w dużym łóżku.
__label__pl	Nie lubię lodów.
__label__pl	Tomek i Maria nadal się kłócą.
__label__pl	Ona będzie sława w przyszłości.
__label__pl	W przyszłości ona będzie sławna.
__label__pl	Czy to coś znaczy, gdy kot przynosi ci martwą mysz?
__label__pl	Niestety muszę cię rozczarować. Nie mam ochoty brać udziału w tej dyskusji.
__label__pl	To jest oficjalna strona.
__label__pl	Nad czym teraz pracuje Thomas?
__label__pl	Pierwszych parę lat było bardzo ciężkich.
__label__pl	Tom jest piekarzem.
__label__pl	Mam nadzieję, że mnie nie zawiedziesz.
__label__pl	Dziadek jest bliski śmierci.
__label__pl	Moja babcia jest stara, ale zdrowa.
__label__pl	Koty zostały udomowione przez egipcjan.
__label__pl	Jesteś farmerem, nie?
__label__pl	Jesteś farmerem, czyż nie?
__label__pl	Często o was myślę.
__label__pl	To nie jest aż tak zły pomysł.
__label__pl	To jest nie najgorszy pomysł.
__label__pl	Stolicą Łotwy jest Ryga.
__label__pl	Co za piękna noc!
__label__pl	Cóż panu wpadło do głowy?!
__label__pl	Jeszcze tu jesteś?
__label__pl	Powtarzały się przy każdej wizycie.
__label__pl	Było bezwzględnie konieczną rzeczą, by Tomek interweniował osobiście.
__label__pl	To jest sprawa niezwykłej wagi.
__label__pl	Jest tu bardzo przytulnie, nieprawda?
__label__pl	Od pewnego momentu, nie zdarza się już nic istotnie ciekawego.
__label__pl	Czy to pana prawdziwe nazwisko?
__label__pl	Co tu jest do powiedzenia?
__label__pl	Był to bardzo długi, wąski pokój o jednym oknie.
__label__pl	Nie powinieneś im we wszystko wierzyć, ze strachu przed biciem już trochę zgupieli.
__label__pl	Wszystko zależy od tego co kto uważa za społeczne, prawda?
__label__pl	Przypuszczam, że wszystko co o mnie mówią, to prawda.
__label__pl	Mój wujek powiada, że jego dziadek pamiętał, kiedy dzieci nie zabijały się nawzajem.
__label__pl	Przynajmniej jeden skorek mieszka w szufladzie starej komody.
__label__pl	Nie bądź taki ą ę!
__label__pl	Jeśli lubiłeś uczyć się rosyjskiego, z pewnością polubisz też polski.
__label__pl	Masz coś mojego.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział Mary, aby była cicho.
__label__pl	Czekają na ciebie dziesiątki listów.
__label__pl	Nigdy nie pomyślałem, że odniosę taki sukces.
__label__pl	Nigdy nie pomyślałam, że odniosę taki sukces.
__label__pl	Nigdy nie pomyślałom, że odniosę taki sukces.
__label__pl	Maria nie była zazdrosna.
__label__pl	Jaki typy żarówki mogą zostać poddane recyklingowi?
__label__pl	Co musze zrobić, aby ludzie zaczęli zwracać na mnie uwagę?
__label__pl	Włamano się do domu Toma.
__label__pl	Mary nie była zazdrosna.
__label__pl	Tomek powiedział Marii, aby była cicho.
__label__pl	Włamano się do domu Tomka.
__label__pl	Rozprzestrzeniać informacje.
__label__pl	Rozprzestrzeniaj informacje!
__label__pl	Tom mówi, że wydaje mu się, że jutro może zostanć zwolniony.
__label__pl	Tomek mówi, że wydaje mu się, że jutro może zostać zwolniony.
__label__pl	Nie ma umiejętności, aby prawidłowo wykonywać swoje zadanie.
__label__pl	Kawa Toma jest dobra.
__label__pl	Kawa Tomka jest dobra.
__label__pl	Nie czuję się dziś najlepiej.
__label__pl	Ten tekst nie jest przetłumaczony.
__label__pl	Ten tekst nie jest przetłumaczonym tekstem.
__label__pl	Jego doktorem jest matka natura.
__label__pl	Nie mam pojęcia jak używać tego narzędzia.
__label__pl	Nie wiem jak używać tego narzędzia.
__label__pl	Zastanawia mnie, czemu Mary się zabiła.
__label__pl	Zastanawia mnie, czemu Maria się zabiła.
__label__pl	Sami chciał popić alkohol jakimś sokiem.
__label__pl	Twoje panowanie będzie krótkie i fatalne w skutkach.
__label__pl	Twoje panowanie będzie fatalne i krótkie.
__label__pl	Mamy teraz inne rzeczy na głowie.
__label__pl	Są inne rzeczy, które teraz powinniśmy robić.
__label__pl	Ktoś ukradł moje pieniądze.
__label__pl	Ten język jest wyłącznie mówiony.
__label__pl	Kiedy wrócisz z Włoch?
__label__pl	Tom pisał Mary długie listy.
__label__pl	Tomek pisał Marii długie listy.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary chcą, abyś ty to zrobił, by oni sami nie musieli tego robić.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary chcą, abyś to zrobił, by oni sami nie musieli tego robić.
__label__pl	Nikt nie powinien być w stanie nas zobaczyć.
__label__pl	Nikt nie powinien nas zobaczyć.
__label__pl	Nie lubię polityki.
__label__pl	Chrześcijaństwo jest piękne.
__label__pl	Do piekła z tym!
__label__pl	Do diabła z tym!
__label__pl	Sami przyjechał z powrotem do domu.
__label__pl	Sami jest muzułmaninem.
__label__pl	Nie przychodź do mojego pokoju.
__label__pl	Ona chce poznać prawdę.
__label__pl	Nie wchodź do mojego pokoju.
__label__pl	Nie wydaje mi się, że to dostaniesz.
__label__pl	Myślę, że nie dostaniesz tego.
__label__pl	Wszystko stało się za szybko.
__label__pl	Ona przypadkowo strzeliła sobie w stopę.
__label__pl	Przez przypadek strzeliła sobie w stopę.
__label__pl	Tomek nie jest pewien.
__label__pl	Tom prawdopodobnie nienawidzi mnie z pasją.
__label__pl	Czy ty nas szpiegujesz?
__label__pl	Czy wy nas szpiegujecie?
__label__pl	Co jest tematem twojego wykładu?
__label__pl	Jaki jest temat waszego wykładu?
__label__pl	Co jest tematem waszego wykładu?
__label__pl	Co jest tematem Państwa wykładu?
__label__pl	Co jest tematem Pani wykładu?
__label__pl	Co jest tematem Pana wykładu?
__label__pl	Plecy mnie swędzą.
__label__pl	On nigdy nie czytał Koranu.
__label__pl	Nie spotykasz się z Tomem prawda?
__label__pl	Nie spotykasz się z Tomkiem prawda?
__label__pl	Nie męczysz się?
__label__pl	Nie zmęczyłeś/zmęczyłaś/zmęczyłoś się?
__label__pl	Mam już dość tego wszystkiego.
__label__pl	Mam już serdecznie dość.
__label__pl	Ten wypadek był osamotnionym wydarzeniem.
__label__pl	Przyprowadź ją do domu.
__label__pl	Algierskie plaże są piękne.
__label__pl	Chce małego, białego psa.
__label__pl	Mary zgodziła sie pójść na randkę w ciemno.
__label__pl	Maria zgodziła się pójść na randkę w ciemno.
__label__pl	Kto powinien uregulować rachunek?
__label__pl	Zapytał mnie o imię ojca Toma
__label__pl	Tom nie obudził się wcześnie rano.
__label__pl	Zapytał mnie o imię ojca Tomka.
__label__pl	My nie wybieramy się do Australii.
__label__pl	Czy Tom również śpiewa?
__label__pl	Ziri zapytał się Yazida czy może pożyczyć jego wyciskacz do mas uszczelniających.

__label__pl	Sami miał starszego brata.
__label__pl	Od razu to polubiłem.
__label__pl	Od razu to polubiłam.
__label__pl	Od raz to polubiłom.
__label__pl	Jak uczysz się niderlandzkiego?
__label__pl	Tom odmawia odejścia.
__label__pl	Tom nie chce odejść.
__label__pl	On jest bardzo dumny ze swoich dzieci.
__label__pl	To było oczywiste, że Tom chciał mnie pocałować.
__label__pl	To było oczywiste, że Tomek chciał mnie pocałować.

__label__pl	Tom poruszył się szybko.
__label__pl	Powiedz nam prawdę, Tom.
__label__pl	Lód był bardzo gruby.
__label__pl	Czy dzieci śpią?
__label__pl	Jak długo byłeś w Anglii?
__label__pl	Woda jest życiem.
__label__pl	Mieszkałem już w Coimbrze.

__label__pl	Tom sądzi, że kocham Mary.
__label__pl	Może pan wstać?
__label__pl	Nie piszę o tobie.
__label__pl	Podam ci przykład.
__label__pl	To jest w każdym razie dobry początek.
__label__pl	Tom wyjaśnił mi, jak to zrobić.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział mi, jak to zrobić.
__label__pl	Tom powoli skinął głową.
__label__pl	Tom prawie się roześmiał.
__label__pl	Tom uśmiechnął się do mnie.
__label__pl	Dobrze znałem twoją matkę.
__label__pl	Tom zrobił krok do tyłu.
__label__pl	To brzmiało łatwo.
__label__pl	Tom zaatakował Marię.
__label__pl	Nawet Tom się uśmiechnął.
__label__pl	Tom skinął na mnie głową.
__label__pl	Przycisnęła dziecko do swojego serca.
__label__pl	Założyłem nową klamkę do drzwi.
__label__pl	Prawdziwy przyjaciel nigdy by o mnie nie zapomniał.
__label__pl	Szukałem pracy.
__label__pl	Szukałem zatrudnienia.
__label__pl	Znam ich ból.
__label__pl	Wierzyłem panu.
__label__pl	Uśmiechnęła się radośnie.

__label__pl	Tom kontynuował kopanie.
__label__pl	Potrzebowałem więcej pieniędzy.
__label__pl	Tom zeskoczył z pirsu.
__label__pl	Tom zeskoczył z molo.
__label__pl	Żaden człowiek nie jest doskonały.
__label__pl	Tom wyglądał na wściekłego.
__label__pl	Nie możemy zabić Toma.
__label__pl	Ta historia przypomniała mi o moim ojcu.
__label__pl	Tom próbował zabić Mary.
__label__pl	Zobaczyłem postać w ciemności.
__label__pl	Polegałem na Tomie.
__label__pl	Tom podskoczył.
__label__pl	Tom szukał Marii.
__label__pl	Poczuł ból w plecach.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że potrzebuje trochę pieniędzy.
__label__pl	Tom westchnął do siebie.
__label__pl	Masz oczywiście rację.
__label__pl	Najwyraźniej masz rację.
__label__pl	Tom dogonił Mary.
__label__pl	Co za myśl!
__label__pl	Stanęła blisko niego.
__label__pl	Jaką ma wysokość?
__label__pl	Nie mam więcej pytań.
__label__pl	Boisz się ciszy?
__label__pl	Tom we mnie wierzył.
__label__pl	Nie potrzebowałem Toma.
__label__pl	Poruszyłem nogami.
__label__pl	Myślę, że jesteśmy już bezpieczni.
__label__pl	Tom mnie nie pamiętał.
__label__pl	Zostawiliśmy Toma samego.
__label__pl	Dlaczego mówi się „Dzień dobry!”, gdy dzień nie jest dobry?
__label__pl	Zostawił swoją rodzinę.
__label__pl	Porzucił swoją rodzinę.
__label__pl	Opuścił swoją rodzinę.
__label__pl	Potrzebowałem pieniędzy.
__label__pl	Krzyknął do niej, żeby uważała.
__label__pl	Twój przyjaciel opuścił miasto.
__label__pl	Wiem, że nie jestem doskonały.
__label__pl	Muszę przynajmniej spróbować.
__label__pl	To było dość oczywiste.
__label__pl	Nigdy nie poznaliśmy się osobiście, ale byliśmy dobrymi przyjaciółmi.
__label__pl	Napisanie tylu zdań na Tatoebie sprawia, że ​​czuję się jak pisarz.
__label__pl	Liczę na to.

__label__pl	Mary jest taka ładna.
__label__pl	Stół nie ma duszy.
__label__pl	Nasz przywódca ma wiele zalet.
__label__pl	Nasz los jest w twoich rękach.
__label__pl	Powinienem był cię ostrzec.
__label__pl	Oto samochód przyszłości.
__label__pl	Czy kąpałbyś się w zimnej wodzie zimą?
__label__pl	Chciałbym przyjść, ale wiesz, że nie mogę.

__label__pl	Piraci nigdy nie piją wody.
__label__pl	Wszyscy szanują cesarza.
__label__pl	Rozmawialiśmy o naszej przeszłości.

__label__pl	Czy ma pan jakieś informacje na ten temat?
__label__pl	Nigdy jej nie zapomnę.
__label__pl	Nikt nie rodzi się mądry, ale wielu umiera głupich.
__label__pl	Tom wytchnął.
__label__pl	Tom podporządkował się.
__label__pl	Miał na imię Tom.

__label__pl	Co to za rzecz?
__label__pl	Sytuacja jest gorsza niż myślałem.
__label__pl	Tom szczerzy się.

__label__pl	Tom robi miłe wrażenie.
__label__pl	Tom wydaje się miły.
__label__pl	Ten materiał jest gładki w dotyku.
__label__pl	Przestańcie strzelać.
__label__pl	Proszę przestać strzelać.
__label__pl	Nie mogę tego stwierdzić.
__label__pl	Rozumie pan teraz?
__label__pl	Tom nie jest chciwy.
__label__pl	Jesteście niezwykli.
__label__pl	On ma duże doświadczenie w tej dziedzinie.
__label__pl	Jesteś potrzebny natychmiast.
__label__pl	Wszyscy próbowali mówić jednocześnie.
__label__pl	To jest strasznie ważne.

__label__pl	Czuję ulgę.
__label__pl	Nie karz dzieci.
__label__pl	W tym miejscu panuje tajemnicza atmosfera.

__label__pl	Tom się nie wycofał.
__label__pl	Tom poszedł za Mary do domu.
__label__pl	Nikt się ze mną nie zgodził.
__label__pl	Tom naprawdę kochał Mary.
__label__pl	Ona sama mu pomogła.
__label__pl	Kiedy ten film się skończy?
__label__pl	Czy to konieczne, żebym dał ci pieniądze?
__label__pl	Dziecko uśmiechnęło się do mnie.
__label__pl	Martwię się o jego bezpieczeństwo.
__label__pl	Zaakceptowali obecną sytuację.
__label__pl	Czy nadal mówi się po egipsku?
__label__pl	W Niemczech mieszka wielu Greków.
__label__pl	Czy Tom skoczył, czy został popchnięty?
__label__pl	Jakiego systemu operacyjnego używasz?
__label__pl	Nie zgadzam się z tobą w tej kwestii.
__label__pl	Po południu odwiedziłam ją w szpitalu, ale zapomniałam o kwiatach.
__label__pl	Aha.
__label__pl	Wszyscy wybiegli na zewnątrz.
__label__pl	Tom odetchnął cicho.
__label__pl	Pies warknął na mnie.
__label__pl	Zrobiłem pięść.
__label__pl	Jedźcie za tym samochodem.
__label__pl	Jestem świadomy tego faktu.
__label__pl	Ma pan jakieś życzenie?
__label__pl	Wzięliśmy to za pewnik.
__label__pl	Tom strzelił do Mary.
__label__pl	Był zdesperowany.
__label__pl	Był zrozpaczony.
__label__pl	Tom odchylił się do tyłu.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że kochał Mary.
__label__pl	Wygląda na to, że im ulżyło.
__label__pl	Większość chłopców zna jego imię.
__label__pl	Zaatakowała go.
__label__pl	Czy płaczą, ponieważ są wzruszeni, czy dlatego, że są smutni?
__label__pl	Dlaczego Tom jest zdenerwowany?
__label__pl	Dlaczego Tom jest podekscytowany?
__label__pl	Nic z tego nie było prawdą.
__label__pl	Tom nie wrócił.
__label__pl	Poszła za nim do domu.
__label__pl	Nauczyłem się paru rzeczy.
__label__pl	Tom wygląda na zdumionego.
__label__pl	Tom ma to, co trzeba.
__label__pl	Kot Toma zniknął na kilka dni.
__label__pl	„Tego właśnie szukałem”, wyjaśnił.
__label__pl	Tom poślizgnął się na lodzie.
__label__pl	Nigdy nie ufałem Tomowi.
__label__pl	Nikt się nie wycofał.

__label__pl	Nie rób z niego wroga.
__label__pl	Mogę przetrwać sam.
__label__pl	Tom wziął głęboki wdech.
__label__pl	Niech pan jedzie za tym samochodem.
__label__pl	Odrzuciła jego ofertę.
__label__pl	Nie ufaj temu, co mówię.
__label__pl	Nie wierz mi na słowo.
__label__pl	Tom pomógł nam to zrobić.
__label__pl	Ma pan swój własny pokój?
__label__pl	Macie swój własny pokój?
__label__pl	Tom nie żyje.
__label__pl	Przyłapałem ich na całowaniu.
__label__pl	Spotkam się z nim po powrocie.
__label__pl	Człowiek jest tylko tym, co wie.
__label__pl	Przetłumacz tekst, proszę.
__label__pl	Nie umrę całkowicie.
__label__pl	Kto kiedyś przeczyta zdania, które napisałem?
__label__pl	Nie mogę się nie zakochać w tobie.
__label__pl	Tom mówił o muzyce.
__label__pl	Czułem się z tym źle.
__label__pl	Mój komputer dziwnie się zachowuje.
__label__pl	Mój komputer świruje.
__label__pl	Przyznaję, że popełniłam błąd.
__label__pl	Tom stracił nadzieję.
__label__pl	Tom był sławny.
__label__pl	Tom mnie zabije.
__label__pl	Tom chce mnie zabić.
__label__pl	Zajmij się tym!
__label__pl	Zajmij się tym.
__label__pl	Nie ma ani przypadku, ani wolnej woli.

__label__pl	Zlituj się nade mną.
__label__pl	Bardzo się cieszył.
__label__pl	Ma to po swoim ojcu.
__label__pl	Są inne dziewczyny.
__label__pl	Nigdy nikomu o tym nie mówiłem.
__label__pl	Musisz powstrzymać Toma!
__label__pl	Moje serce było pełne radości.
__label__pl	Nie mogę pana powstrzymać.
__label__pl	Jestem w tym nowy.
__label__pl	Przyjmuję tę propozycję.
__label__pl	Kto zapłacił za twoją edukację?
__label__pl	Kto opłacił twoje czesne?
__label__pl	Tom jest najwyższy w swojej rodzinie.
__label__pl	Wczoraj spotkałem jednego z największych aktorów naszego pokolenia.

__label__pl	Próbowałem, ale poniosłem porażkę.
__label__pl	Bardzo podobał mi się ten film.
__label__pl	Związała go.
__label__pl	Tom pochylił się do przodu.
__label__pl	Proszę zastosować się do mojej rady.
__label__pl	Moja czaszka mnie zabija.
__label__pl	Robię, co mi każą.
__label__pl	Przestali się śmiać.
__label__pl	Zadzwonił dzwonek do drzwi.
__label__pl	Tom cię powstrzyma.
__label__pl	Tom cię zatrzyma.
__label__pl	Proszę tu podejść.
__label__pl	Naprawdę nie mam karabinu.
__label__pl	Proszę nie zaglądać do pudełka!
__label__pl	Poraził mnie piorun.
__label__pl	Posiada pan broń?
__label__pl	Rzadko miewam gości.
__label__pl	Mogłem to przewidzieć.
__label__pl	Powinienem był ostrzec pana wcześniej.
__label__pl	Tom często łamie swoje obietnice.
__label__pl	Tom często nie dotrzymuje słowa.
__label__pl	To wszystko nie ma sensu.
__label__pl	Gdzie chcesz iść dziś wieczorem?
__label__pl	Tom jest prawdopodobnie ok.
__label__pl	Ilu surferów widziałeś?
__label__pl	Kiedy urodziło się dziecko?
__label__pl	Czy pokój zdobywa się tylko wojną?
__label__pl	Wojna będzie istniała zawsze, dopóki człowiek w końcu nie pozna samego siebie.
__label__pl	Musiałem się bronić.
__label__pl	Jaka jest różnica między tymi pojęciami?
__label__pl	To będzie cię dodatkowo kosztować.
__label__pl	Pochowamy cię.
__label__pl	Tom jest rozbawiony.
__label__pl	Bardzo za panem tęsknimy.
__label__pl	Kogo się boisz?
__label__pl	Smutek i szczęście to przeciwne uczucia.
__label__pl	Ona na zawsze zostanie w moim sercu.
__label__pl	Tom mieszka niedaleko lotniska.
__label__pl	Mamy prawo do strajku.
__label__pl	Mój osioł jest szybszy niż twój samochód.
__label__pl	Ile fraz dodałeś dzisiaj?
__label__pl	Ten język byłby ciekawszy, gdyby nie miał tylu ograniczeń.
__label__pl	Bardzo za tobą tęskniłem, kiedy byłeś we Francji.
__label__pl	Tom nazwał mnie grubasem.
__label__pl	Schodzimy mu z drogi.
__label__pl	Niech się pan kontroluje.
__label__pl	Niech pan przejmie dowodzenie.
__label__pl	Przejmij dowództwo.
__label__pl	Tom uniósł brew.
__label__pl	Tomek zdobył już wiele medali.
__label__pl	Smoki to nie zwierzęta domowe.
__label__pl	Okrąg ma trzysta sześćdziesiąt stopni.

__label__pl	Na śniadanie jem chleb z dżemem.
__label__pl	Kim byłbym bez moich nauczycieli?
__label__pl	Dwie zielone papugi mówiły do mnie.
__label__pl	Rozmawiały ze mną dwie zielone papugi.
__label__pl	To jest byk czy wół?
__label__pl	Kiedyś kupowała białe myszki dla swojego boa dusiciela, żeby je zabił i zjadł.
__label__pl	Konie są wyższe i biegają szybciej niż osły.
__label__pl	Czy mogę coś zrobić?
__label__pl	Pszczoła to nie ptak.
__label__pl	Króliki lubią jeść marchewki.
__label__pl	Łyżka czy łyżeczka?
__label__pl	Największą zaletą Tatoeby jest jej interaktywność.
__label__pl	Osuszyła łzy chusteczką.
__label__pl	Jest pan zawsze mile widziany!
__label__pl	Jesteśmy potężni.
__label__pl	Słyszałem wczoraj wieczorem moich szepczących rodziców.
__label__pl	Straciłem 30 funtów.
__label__pl	Wyszedłem z mojej kabiny na pokład.

__label__pl	Nóż jest twardy, ugotowany ziemniak jest miękki.
__label__pl	Maria urodziła córkę.
__label__pl	Ja też cały czas chciałem o to zapytać.
__label__pl	Nikt tutaj temu nie zaprzecza.
__label__pl	Nie muszę tego gotować.
__label__pl	Ona przynosi ser.
__label__pl	Te winogrona nie są dojrzałe.
__label__pl	Mamy stół w kuchni.
__label__pl	Jedzenie było bardzo słone.
__label__pl	Papuga mojego sąsiada mówi po rumuńsku.
__label__pl	Ile ci wiszę?
__label__pl	Dni są ciepłe, noce zimne.
__label__pl	A co jeśli powiem "nie"?
__label__pl	Skąd wiesz to wszystko?
__label__pl	Stół jest pełen owoców.
__label__pl	Kanarek to mały żółty ptak.
__label__pl	Indyk jest w piekarniku.

__label__pl	Pająki jedzą owady.
__label__pl	Do szkoły poszłam po raz pierwszy, gdy miałam siedem lat. I uczę się do dziś, bo wciąż mam wiele do nauczenia.
__label__pl	Najtrudniejsze są języki starożytne.
__label__pl	Kieliszki są puste, a wino się skończyło.
__label__pl	Stał zdala od nas.
__label__pl	On żyje zdala od swojej rodziny.
__label__pl	Ile czasu upłynęło?
__label__pl	Upłynęła mniej więcej jedna godzina.
__label__pl	Minęła tylko godzina, zanim cała woda wyparowała.
__label__pl	Ta plotka jest w pewnym stopniu prawdą.
__label__pl	Nikt nie ucieknie przed swoim przeznaczeniem.
__label__pl	Szklanka jest pełna wody.
__label__pl	W języku rumuńskim „gol” oznacza „pusty”.
__label__pl	Nietoperz zjada motyla.
__label__pl	W kuchni mamy słone mięso.
__label__pl	Jak długo jesteście razem?
__label__pl	Zatrzymaj resztę.
__label__pl	Jeśli jest ktoś, kto może to zrobić, to właśnie ona.
__label__pl	Utopił się w basenie.
__label__pl	Moje dzieci są piękne.
__label__pl	Czy są moje czy twoje?
__label__pl	Bardzo chciałbym odwiedzić Grecję i Rumunię.

__label__pl	Podoba mi się twoja dupa.
__label__pl	Szukamy cię!
__label__pl	Właściwie miałem ci to powiedzieć dzisiaj.
__label__pl	Moja mama miała trzynaścioro dzieci.
__label__pl	Pisanie nie jest łatwe.
__label__pl	Nie mamy z tym nic wspólnego.
__label__pl	Co jeszcze można powiedzieć?
__label__pl	Co słychać u was?
__label__pl	Czy możemy mieć to już za sobą?
__label__pl	Ja też nie wiem, co powinienem robić.
__label__pl	Truskawka nie jest smaczniejsza od banana.
__label__pl	Kobiety są równie mądre jak mężczyźni.
__label__pl	Jeszcze nie można przewidzieć skutków wybuchu w elektrowni.
__label__pl	Stała kontrola jakości naszych produktów jest dla nas bardzo ważna.
__label__pl	Nie możemy odstąpić od tego postanowienia.
__label__pl	To chyba nie jest twoja czapka?
__label__pl	Przez jakiś czas czekałam na odpowiedź, ale potem uświadomiłam sobie, że ona nigdy nie przyjdzie.
__label__pl	Myślę, że powinien pójść na terapię.
__label__pl	Słyszałam, że ktoś gwiżdże.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że myśli, że jest duża szansa na opady śniegu.

__label__pl	Wszyscy rozmawiali.
__label__pl	Poproszę Toma, żeby nauczył mnie prowadzić.
__label__pl	Poproszę Toma, żeby nauczył mnie prowadzić samochód.
__label__pl	Poproszę Toma, żeby uczył mnie prowadzić samochód.

__label__pl	Gdzie jest twój brat, Abel?
__label__pl	Mam na sobie spodnie, koszulę i buty.
__label__pl	A to co? Samochód? Raczej zardzewiała puszka.
__label__pl	Czy on nie był kiedyś twoim przyjacielem?
__label__pl	Nadal pije piwo w wieku osiemdziesięciu lat.
__label__pl	Moim zdaniem palenie jest czynnością śmieszną i odrażającą, poza tym bardzo szkodliwą dla zdrowia.
__label__pl	Nie uważam się za zdolnego do rozsądnego przetłumaczenia jakiegokolwiek zdania na toki ponę.
__label__pl	Dla osoby niepalącej usta palacza smakują jak popiół i dym.
__label__pl	Miałem niepalącego kolegę i sąsiada, którego żona paliła. Pomyślałem sobie: do jakich poświęceń miłość nie może zmusić człowieka!
__label__pl	Chcę zobaczyć, co masz u siebie w domu.
__label__pl	Dlaczego mi to robisz?
__label__pl	Zostali dobrymi przyjaciółmi.
__label__pl	Dlaczego nie masz dzisiaj czasu?
__label__pl	Niektóre kobiety są wyższe od mężczyzn.
__label__pl	Zakładaj, że każdy problem w twoim życiu jest lekcją, która cię wzmocni. Wtedy nigdy nie będziesz czuć się ofiarą.

__label__pl	Potrafisz przyrządzić omleta?
__label__pl	Proszę, potrzymaj mi rower.
__label__pl	Layla miała wylew kilka dni po czterdziestych czwartych urodzinach.
__label__pl	Tom delikatnie się odsunął od Mary.
__label__pl	Ja mówię po francusku i Tom też.
__label__pl	Nie, to nie jest prawda!
__label__pl	Tak naprawdę nie jestem twoim przyjacielem. Tylko udawałem.
__label__pl	Nie rozumiem, co masz na myśli, ale podoba mi się to.
__label__pl	Mój szef jest dupkiem.
__label__pl	Czy grasz na jeszcze jakichś instrumentach oprócz fortepianu?
__label__pl	Lubię groszek.
__label__pl	To jest moja ostatnia oferta.
__label__pl	Moja mama nie widziała chłopca na ulicy.
__label__pl	Potrzebują jej.
__label__pl	To okropnie pachnie.
__label__pl	Tom uważa, że Ziemia jest pusta w środku.
__label__pl	W tym jeziorze nie wolno pływać.
__label__pl	Myślę, że trzy lata to dużo czasu.
__label__pl	O czym myśli Christian?
__label__pl	Matka Toma była mądrą kobietą.
__label__pl	Niewątpliwie miałem szczęście.
__label__pl	Potrzebuję tych butów.
__label__pl	Tom jest przytomny.
__label__pl	Nie wspomniałem o jednej rzeczy.
__label__pl	Zainteresowała mnie twoja uwaga.
__label__pl	Nie zawiedź mnie.
__label__pl	Tom był liderem.
__label__pl	Tom ma ważną misję do wykonania.
__label__pl	Czy to naprawdę takie ważne?
__label__pl	Silnik uruchomił się ponownie.
__label__pl	Nie mam nic do ukrycia.
__label__pl	Pokój był pełny dymu.
__label__pl	Jesteśmy zdumieni.
__label__pl	Jutro pierwszy maja. Jest poniedziałek.
__label__pl	Najpierw posłuchaj, co mam do powiedzenia.
__label__pl	Mógłbyś mi w czymś pomóc?
__label__pl	Narodziny i śmierć to nie to samo.
__label__pl	Kto czyta, żyje tysiącem istnień.
__label__pl	Jestem światłem, drogą i życiem.
__label__pl	Zadzwoń po karetkę! On jest ciężko ranny!
__label__pl	Mój kot zabił tą mysz.
__label__pl	Posoliłeś to?
__label__pl	Posoliłaś to?
__label__pl	Śmierdzi jakby tu ktoś w środku palił papierosy.
__label__pl	Ona sprzedaje książki.
__label__pl	Toma tu nie ma.
__label__pl	Masz masę znajomych.
__label__pl	Tom powiedział, że mógłby to naprawić.
__label__pl	Tom jest po rozwodzie.
__label__pl	Tom jest na ścisłej diecie wegańskiej.
__label__pl	Mam metr dziewięćdziesiąt.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary czekali cały ranek, aby ktoś im pomógł.
__label__pl	Chcę tylko twojej miłości.
__label__pl	Znałeś Toma, co nie?
__label__pl	Znałaś Toma, co nie?
__label__pl	Nie wiem, czy to jest dobry pomysł.
__label__pl	Tom ma nadzieję, że Mary mu przebaczy.
__label__pl	Nie widzę z tym żadnego problemu.
__label__pl	Radio jest na stole.
__label__pl	Jeden z nastolatków krzyknął.
__label__pl	Tom i Mary są małżonkami.
__label__pl	Tom nie bierze swojej pracy zbyt poważnie.
__label__pl	Myślę, że wreszcie przejdę na emeryturę.
__label__pl	Lubię pieśni ludowe.
__label__pl	Halo, jest tam ktoś?
__label__pl	Zasady to zasady.
__label__pl	On położył klucz na stole.
__label__pl	Udało nam się?
__label__pl	Jesteśmy gośćmi.
__label__pl	Podoba ci się kurtka?
__label__pl	On miał duży dom i dwa samochody.
__label__pl	Dziadek Toma znał mojego dziadka.
__label__pl	Nie mam ani jednego wroga.
__label__pl	Czy jesteś córką Toma?
__label__pl	Zapomniałem kupić ci prezent.
__label__pl	Zapomniałam kupić ci prezent.
__label__pl	Tylko spróbuj mnie powstrzymać!
__label__pl	Ona jest w dostatecznym wieku, żeby sama podróżować.
__label__pl	Tom dostał koszyk od Mary.
__label__pl	Wiem, że się mylę.
__label__pl	Wiem, że jestem w błędzie.
__label__pl	Wiem, że nie mam racji.
__label__pl	Tom umie pływać o wiele szybciej niż Mary.
__label__pl	Jego celem jest zostać nauczycielem.
__label__pl	Zrób to prędko.
__label__pl	Serio nie mam już na to ochoty.
__label__pl	Tom się chowa.
__label__pl	Córka mojej córki to moja wnuczka.
__label__pl	Co to to nie my.
__label__pl	Córka mojej córki jest moją wnuczką.
__label__pl	Nie dostałem od nikogo odpowiedzi.
__label__pl	Bakterie można zobaczyć tylko przy użyciu mikroskopu.
__label__pl	Głosuj na nas.
__label__pl	Kiedy wracasz?
__label__pl	Napisałam list.
__label__pl	Nie mogę jeść czekolady.
__label__pl	Oboje mamy tyle samo lat.
__label__pl	Nie zaczepiaj obcych ludzi.
__label__pl	Nie zaczepiaj obcych ludzi na ulicy.
__label__pl	Przyszedłem tutaj wraz z moimi przyjaciółmi.
__label__pl	Głosuj na Cthulhu.
__label__pl	Głosujcie na Cthulhu.
__label__pl	Możemy zjeść parówki na śniadanie.
__label__pl	Naprawdę się starałem.
__label__pl	Czy to jest ten nowy film?
__label__pl	Chyba już tego nie zniosę.
__label__pl	Obecnie nie zabijam nawet muchy. Zabiłem wielu, kiedy byłem dzieckiem.
__label__pl	Urodziła się, aby mnie uszczęśliwić.
__label__pl	Język łaciński żyje w Tatoeba.
__label__pl	Proszę, nie pytaj mnie.
__label__pl	Nienawidzi swojej teściowej.
__label__pl	Widzimy się jutro?
__label__pl	Potrzebujesz niego.
__label__pl	Czy ktoś może mi odpowiedzieć?
__label__pl	Czy ktoś może podać mi odpowiedź?
__label__pl	Moja kolej żeby zapłacić?
__label__pl	Mój dom leży na północ od miasta.
__label__pl	Sądząc po jego akcencie, jest z Osaki.
__label__pl	Jak często odjeżdżają pociągi?
__label__pl	Powiedz Tomowi, że jestem gotowy.
__label__pl	Jak to ma się do sprawy?
__label__pl	Bilety kosztują 20 jenów sztuka.
__label__pl	Naprawdę jesteś tak naiwny?
__label__pl	Jesteś dobry w tenisa?
__label__pl	To nie była łatwa decyzja.
__label__pl	Tom wolno otworzył drzwi.
__label__pl	Nie chciałem jej ponownie zobaczyć.
__label__pl	Nie chciałam jej ponownie zobaczyć.
__label__pl	Tłumacz popełnił niewybaczalny błąd.
__label__pl	Żył już dziewięć dekad.
__label__pl	Musisz być bardziej uważny.
__label__pl	Musisz być bardziej uważna.
__label__pl	Tom nienawidzi oliwek.
__label__pl	Bill Gates jest najbogatszym człowiekiem na świecie.
__label__pl	Nie zaprzeczam temu.
__label__pl	Czy tu zawsze jest tak zimno?
__label__pl	Tom nie wie, od czego zacząć.
__label__pl	Znowu sałatka?
__label__pl	Chcesz jeszcze jedną kanapkę?
__label__pl	Znasz jego starszego brata?
__label__pl	Nie usiądzie Pan z nami?
__label__pl	Nie usiądzie Pani z nami?
__label__pl	Nie usiądą Państwo z nami?
__label__pl	Czy to świeczki?
__label__pl	Czy to są świeczki?
__label__pl	Tom przebiegł maraton w mniej niż pięć godzin.
__label__pl	Czy konflikt jest nieunikniony?
__label__pl	Mieszkasz w Niemczech, Tiziri?
__label__pl	Jestem bardzo niska.
__label__pl	Niektórzy mówią to, a inny mówią tamto.
__label__pl	Tom prawdopodobnie nadal jest nieprzytomny.
__label__pl	On jest prawdziwym muzułmaninem.
__label__pl	Nie jestem w tym zbyt dobry.
__label__pl	Nie jestem w tym zbyt dobra.
__label__pl	Chcę ten telewizor.
__label__pl	Ludzie często opowiadają barmanom całą swoją historię życiową.
__label__pl	Zadzwoń do ojca.
__label__pl	Dzwoń do ojca.
__label__pl	Czy ona mnie zna?
__label__pl	On dobrze wygląda.
__label__pl	Mary powiedziała, że myśli, że Tom się zmęczył.
__label__pl	Mary powiedziała, że myślała, że Tom się zmęczył.
__label__pl	Zważyłem to.
__label__pl	Sami poszła do apteki.
__label__pl	Tom dużo rozmawia przez telefon.
__label__pl	W snach jesteśmy wolni.
__label__pl	Postanowiłam napisać powieść.
__label__pl	Postanowiłem napisać powieść.
__label__pl	Masz coś na ustach.
__label__pl	Wojna wybuchła w 1941 roku.
__label__pl	Zgodziliśmy się na jego propozycję.
__label__pl	Nie sądziłem, że ci się to uda.
__label__pl	Inni mieszkańcy osiedla sądzili, że jesteśmy nietowarzyscy.
__label__pl	Proszę, przebacz mi.
__label__pl	Po prostu nie mogę mu tego przebaczyć.
__label__pl	Błagam o przebaczenie.
__label__pl	Ona ciągle wypomina mu błędy sprzed lat.
__label__pl	Co byś zrobił, gdybyś mógł o tym zapomnieć?
__label__pl	Najbardziej charakterystycznym objawem demencji starczej są problemy z pamięcią.
__label__pl	Zostało tylko kilka dni do egzaminów.
__label__pl	Prawdę mówiąc, zupełnie nie wiem, jak się do tego zabrać.
__label__pl	Poczekasz na mnie jeszcze chwilkę?
__label__pl	Wyprałaś te nowe dżinsowe spodnie?
__label__pl	Cały czas spadają mi spodenki.
__label__pl	Odłóż ten nóż, żeby się nie pokaleczyć.
__label__pl	Muszę to znowu sprawdzić bo już zdążyłam zapomnieć.
__label__pl	Tom wiedział, co robi.
__label__pl	Czy masz specjalnie menu dla wegetarian?
__label__pl	To była straszna panika.
__label__pl	Jego arogancja strasznie mnie frustruje.
__label__pl	On był moim pierwszym chłopakiem.
__label__pl	Lekarz nie mógł się pogodzić ze śmiercią swojego najstarszego pacjenta.
__label__pl	Cieszę się, że to poszło tak jak poszło.
__label__pl	Wiara jest śmiercią intelektu.
__label__pl	Tom potrzebuje nowych ubrań.
__label__pl	Mój ojciec zmarł dziesięć lat temu.
__label__pl	Ona kocha swoje dzieci.__label__de	Noch als Student forschte Adams an einer Erklärung für die Unregelmäßigkeiten in der Bewegung des Planeten Uranus. Er vermutete, dass die unerwartete Planetenbahn durch das Vorhandensein eines bis dahin noch unentdeckten Planeten hervorgerufen werden könnte.

__label__de	Tom hatte sich wahnsinnig in sie verliebt.
__label__de	Ich bin Zweitsemestler.
__label__de	Esst das Brot!

__label__de	Schon marschierte das gesamte Heer mit seinen genährten Schwadronen und in reichen, bunten Uniformen über das offene Feld.
__label__de	Seht, o Bürger, was für eine Kugel aus schwarzem Staub, auf uns zukommt! Bringt schnell die Waffen, verteilt die Pfeile, rennt zu den Mauern, hussa, der Feind ist da!
__label__de	Ich bin bei laufendem Radio eingeschlafen.
__label__de	Tom beschloss, nicht auf Maria zu warten.
__label__de	Ich hatte keine Zeit, um es Tom zu erklären.
__label__de	Ich habe noch nicht alle Bücher gelesen, die Tom mir geliehen hat.
__label__de	Es gibt Leute, die öfter als ich in der Stadt gewesen sind.
__label__de	Dafür kommt Tom ins Gefängnis.
__label__de	Tom hat mir seine Telefonnummer gegeben.
__label__de	Tom hat viele Jahre bei uns gearbeitet.
__label__de	Da es sonst keiner wollte, bot ich es Tom an.
__label__de	Die Gravitationskraft fällt mit der Entfernung schnell ab.

__label__de	Das ist ein Konzertalbum.
__label__de	Er hat eine schöne, sonnengebräunte Haut.
__label__de	Tom hat im Krankenhaus nicht viel Besuch bekommen.
__label__de	Tom hat im Oktober gekündigt.
__label__de	Tom ist letzten Oktober in den Ruhestand gegangen.
__label__de	Es ist schade, dass wir nicht dieselbe Sprache sprechen.
__label__de	Ich wünschte, wir sprächen dieselbe Sprache!
__label__de	Ich würde irgendwann mal gerne lernen, einen Drachen steigen zu lassen.
__label__de	Tom, wir kennen uns doch schon lange. Ich weiß, was dieser Gesichtsausdruck bedeutet!
__label__de	„Zieh doch irgendwohin, wo mehr los ist!“ – „So einfach ist das nicht. Ich bin verheiratet und habe Kinder.“ – „Und dein Mann kommt aus dieser Gegend.“ – „Genaugenommen meine Frau. Nein, die kommt aus Middlesbrough.“
__label__de	Tom lebt im Netz.
__label__de	Litauen war damals viel größer.
__label__de	Schaffen wir die Arbeit ab!
__label__de	Lasst uns die Arbeit abschaffen!
__label__de	Viele sind schon öfter in der Stadt gewesen als ich.
__label__de	Heute ist Toms freier Tag.
__label__de	Es nervt mich, dass ich bei Tom immer so lange auf eine Antwort warten muss, wenn ich überhaupt eine kriege.

__label__de	In Australien wird die Feuerwehrarbeit technisch immer ausgereifter.
__label__de	Halloween ist kein religiöser Feiertag.
__label__de	Tom und Maria haben ein Tier aus dem Tierheim geholt.
__label__de	Bin mir nicht sicher bei folgenden drei Stellen und würde mich über Hilfe freuen!
__label__de	Tom ist eine tickende Zeitbombe. Maria sollte sich möglichst schnell von ihm trennen.
__label__de	Tom kam total erledigt von der Arbeit nach Hause.
__label__de	Hast du mich noch lieb?
__label__de	Maria wird morgen kommen.
__label__de	Tom hat zwei Enkelsöhne.
__label__de	Mein Name ist Carlos, ich bin Brasilianer.
__label__de	Der Mann und die Frau haben ein Kind.
__label__de	Wir sind drei: der Vater, die Mutter und das Kind.
__label__de	Die Heiratenden wollen ein Haus.
__label__de	Es gibt einige Dinge, die ich lernen möchte.
__label__de	Alle Kinder schlafen.
__label__de	Ich bin verheiratet und habe drei Kinder.
__label__de	Wie viel Grad hat es in der Wohnung?
__label__de	Was sich einer versagt – so viel mehr schenken ihm die Götter.
__label__de	Gefragt, was auf Erden das Seltenste sei, antwortet einer: was allen gehört, der gemeine Verstand.
__label__de	Wir können weder alle zählen, denen Unheil widerfahren ist, noch auch nur einen von ihnen würdig beklagen.
__label__de	Die Vernunft ist ein Licht. Davon will und soll die Natur erleuchtet, jedoch nicht in Brand gesteckt werden.
__label__de	In der Gesellschaft ist äußerst selten: ein wirklich erträglicher Mensch.
__label__de	Die Kinder finden im Nichts das Gesamte, die Erwachsenen im Gesamten das Nichts.
__label__de	Ein eifersüchtiger Mann zu seiner Ehefrau: Ist dir denn nicht bewusst, du Teufel, dass du schön bist wie ein Engel?
__label__de	Diese Krankheit führt unbehandelt zum Tod.
__label__de	Es war ein gutes Leben.
__label__de	Maria ist bezaubernd schön.
__label__de	Er ist quasi ganz süß.
__label__de	Was hat das alles gekostet?
__label__de	Ich bin eine Bürofrau.
__label__de	Toms Französisch ist saumäßig.
__label__de	Um wieviel Uhr ist es zu Ende?
__label__de	Du hast Glück, dass Toms Hund dich nicht gebissen hat.
__label__de	An der Wand hingen drei Bilder.
__label__de	Tom braucht Platz.
__label__de	Toms Hund wartete auf der Veranda darauf, dass Tom nach Hause kam.
__label__de	Tom und Maria haben sich auf dem Oktoberfest kennengelernt.
__label__de	Das wollte ich Tom gerade fragen.
__label__de	Warum ist Tom nach Boston gezogen?
__label__de	Oma, komm schnell! Du bist im Fernsehen!
__label__de	Tom ließ Maria nicht aus dem Zimmer.
__label__de	Was für Gemüse baust du an?
__label__de	Was für Gemüse baut ihr an?
__label__de	Was für Gemüse bauen Sie an?
__label__de	Ich wollte heute nicht weg, aber ich musste.
__label__de	Tom hatte dafür keine Zeit.
__label__de	Ich wusste nicht, dass ich das sollte.
__label__de	Tom hat sich verrechnet.
__label__de	Tom hätte nicht so gemein zu sein brauchen.
__label__de	Ich trage gewöhnlich schwarze Socken.
__label__de	Tom hat eine Ruhepause verdient.
__label__de	Als ich ins Zimmer kam, sah ich, dass Tom tief und fest schlief.
__label__de	Als Kind mochte ich keine Tomaten.
__label__de	Sag ihr bitte, dass sie warten soll!
__label__de	Geh sofort dahin!
__label__de	Tom hat 30 kg zugenommen.
__label__de	Danke! Das wäre aber nicht nötig gewesen!
__label__de	Die Schüler sind lieb zueinander.
__label__de	„Alle Kanadier sollten, soweit es geht, zu Hause bleiben“, sagte Trudeau.
__label__de	Sie dürfen nur mit ja oder nein antworten.
__label__de	Verbessert sich das Sehvermögen, wenn man davon träumt, Karotten zu essen?
__label__de	Was ist denn das für ein Kabelsalat, den du da unter dem Schreibtisch hast? Entwirre den mal!
__label__de	Tom ist bei seinem eigenen Vater ins Haus eingebrochen.
__label__de	Heutzutage ist alles aus Plastik.
__label__de	Ich freue mich, dass du mich ins Vertrauen gezogen hast, aber helfen kann ich dir wahrscheinlich nicht, auch wenn meine Beziehung zu deinem Vater in den letzten zwei Wochen wieder besser geworden ist.
__label__de	Eigentlich wollten wir ja über meine Probleme reden, aber wenn du noch ein bisschen über deine reden willst, höre ich dir gerne zu.
__label__de	Wie du wieder aussiehst, Tom! Und dieser Bart und diese Haare! Also nein!
__label__de	Es tut mir in der Seele weh, wie hässlich diese Leute zueinander sind.
__label__de	Er kann kein Englisch und Deutsch schon gar nicht.
__label__de	Was darf ich Ihnen anbieten?
__label__de	Dadurch wird die Vorstellung begünstigt, dass Wohlstand und irdischer Erfolg Zeichen der Gunst Gottes seien.
__label__de	Ich bin schwer.
__label__de	Die offizielle Sprache der Vereinigten Staaten wäre fast das Deutsche geworden.
__label__de	Es ist nie zu spät, sein Leben zu ändern.
__label__de	Es ist nie zu spät, alles zu ändern.
__label__de	Sie hat keine Probleme in der Schule.
__label__de	Ich habe mit meinen Kollegen darüber gesprochen.
__label__de	Ich kam mir wirklich blöd vor.
__label__de	Tom kümmert sich um die Pferde.
__label__de	Kätzchen sind süß und lieb.
__label__de	Wie die Erde, so hat auch der Mars am Nord- und Südpol Eiskappen.
__label__de	Maria hoffte, dass sich Tom trauen würde, sie zu küssen.
__label__de	Hast du alles getan, worum ich dich bat?
__label__de	Er war voll wie eine Strandhaubitze.
__label__de	Es ist wichtig, viel Wasser zu trinken.
__label__de	Die Kneipe ist ein Ort des gemeinsamen Trinkens.
__label__de	Soll es leer bleiben?
__label__de	Amerikanische Autos sind sehr groß.
__label__de	Ohne unseren Glauben hätten wir gar nichts -- außer einem unbezwingbaren Schicksal, Tag für Tag.
__label__de	Mit jedem Menschen wird eine Welt geboren; mit jedem Menschen geht eine Welt unter.
__label__de	Ich befürchte, Sie haben eine falsche Vorstellung von mir.
__label__de	Welche Nummer hat die Rettung?
__label__de	Hör auf, den Kindern Angst einzujagen.
__label__de	Er lebte über seinen Verhältnissen.
__label__de	Er lebte über seine Verhältnisse.
__label__de	Du weißt das am besten.
__label__de	Tom ist vermutlich im Hinterhof.
__label__de	Die kalten Tage kommen.
__label__de	Warum haben Sie Tom nicht gelassen?
__label__de	Dieses Zimmer haben wir noch nie benutzt.
__label__de	Tom geht vor dem Frühstück immer spazieren.
__label__de	Mit soviel Widerstand hätten wir nicht gerechnet.
__label__de	Früher ist Tom jeden Tag vor dem Frühstück spazierengegangen.
__label__de	Es sollte eigentlich noch mehr geforscht werden, aber aus Kapitalmangel war das nicht möglich.
__label__de	Tom lobte Maria.
__label__de	Wir hätten nicht damit gerechnet, dass so viele Leute kämen.
__label__de	Früher bin ich zu Fuß zur Arbeit gegangen.
__label__de	Tom und Maria haben früher oft zusammen zu Mittag gegessen.
__label__de	Tom und Maria essen oft zusammen zu Mittag.
__label__de	Wer ist denn die Frau, die da mit Tom spricht?
__label__de	Dieses Zimmer benutzen wir überhaupt nicht.
__label__de	Dieses Zimmer werden wir wohl nicht wieder benutzen.
__label__de	Vielleicht ist Tom im Garten.
__label__de	Es besteht die Möglichkeit, dass Tom im Garten ist.
__label__de	Tom geht zwar nicht mehr jeden Tag, aber noch ein paarmal in der Woche vor dem Frühstück spazieren.
__label__de	Tom geht zwar nicht mehr jeden Morgen, aber noch ein paarmal in der Woche vor dem Frühstück spazieren.
__label__de	Tom geht zwar nicht mehr jeden Tag vor dem Frühstück spazieren, aber ein paarmal in der Woche tut er’s doch noch.
__label__de	Tom hat gerade seinen Zug verpasst.
__label__de	„Ich mag dich sehr, aber ich kann dir nicht helfen.“ – „Wenn ich nicht wüsste, dass du es kannst, säße ich jetzt nicht hier und bäte dich.“
__label__de	„Ich kenne meine Tochter, und ein reicher Mann war schon immer ihr Traum.“ – „Aber der Schmidt ist doch kein reicher Mann.“ – „Doch, das ist er, obwohl er sich nicht so gibt.“
__label__de	„Was ist denn hier passiert?“ – „Wenn ich das wüsste, würde ich es dir nicht sagen.“
__label__de	„Es ist alles meine Schuld.“ – „Jetzt hör auf, dir Vorwürfe zu machen!“
__label__de	Wir haben die Tür geöffnet und sind eingetreten.
__label__de	Gibt es eine gute Methode, um Mäuse zu fangen?
__label__de	Ich habe mir das Medikament auf die Tastatur gelegt, um nicht zu vergessen, es pünktlich einzunehmen.
__label__de	Versuche nicht zu weinen.
__label__de	Versucht nicht zu weinen.
__label__de	Es ist mir ziemlich egal, ob Sie mir glauben oder nicht.
__label__de	Wenn du dich nicht beeilst, verpasst du deinen Zug.
__label__de	Alles, was Sie tun müssen, ist auf seine Ankuft zu warten.
__label__de	Die Leute denken, das sei leicht.
__label__de	Wo sind meine Ringe?
__label__de	Toms Mutter musste sehr enttäuscht gewesen sein.
__label__de	Er war irgendwie in der Lage über den Fluss zu schwimmen.
__label__de	Du bist dir da sicher, oder?
__label__de	Das ist eine Frage, die ich nicht beantworten kann.
__label__de	Tom drückte Maria fest an seine Brust und flüsterte ihr „Ich liebe dich!“ ins Haar.
__label__de	Diesmal wird es anders sein.
__label__de	Diesmal wird alles anders sein.
__label__de	Tom kaufte sich ein kleines Haus in einer ruhigen Straße.
__label__de	Die besten Plätze waren alle schon besetzt.
__label__de	Unser Gespräch wurde unterbrochen.
__label__de	Er hat für mich alles getan, was er konnte.
__label__de	Tom hat seinen ersten Wagen erstanden.
__label__de	Ich hab dich seit Jahren nicht gesehen.
__label__de	Ich wollte meinen Freund nicht zu lange warten lassen.
__label__de	Ich wollte meine Freundin nicht zu lange warten lassen.
__label__de	Iwan Zarewitsch kam zum Vater: „Wie kann ich die Fröschin freien?“ klagte der Sohn. „Ist sie mir denn ebenbürtig? Gewisslich nicht!“ – „Das ist einerlei“, erwiderte der Vater. „Du musst die Fröschin freien, denn das ist offensichtlich dein Schicksal.“
__label__de	Euphrat und Tigris entspringen in der Türkei und fließen dann durch Syrien (bzw. an ihm entlang) und den Irak.
__label__de	Reichtümer allein werden mich nicht zufriedenstellen.
__label__de	Um Gottes willen, Mr. Holmes! Was ist denn los?
__label__de	Tom wohnt in einem Haus, das in den 1700er Jahren erbaut wurde.
__label__de	Wie findest du die Party?
__label__de	Er hängt sehr an seiner Schwester.
__label__de	Hier ist es zum Lesen zu dunkel.
__label__de	Wir hätten nicht gedacht, dass wir gewännen.
__label__de	Es ist Feuer unter der Brücke.
__label__de	Unter der Brücke brennt es.
__label__de	Amtssprache in Deutschland wird bald Englisch sein.
__label__de	Ich habe dir schon hundertmal gesagt, dass du an der Stelle ein Fis spielen musst und kein F.
__label__de	Tom wollte reden; sonst wäre er doch nicht einen Tag, bevor er sich umgebracht hat, hierhergekommen. Er ist immer zu mir gekommen, wenn er Probleme hatte.
__label__de	Vielleicht hätte ich die Tat verhindern können, wenn ich dagewesen wäre.
__label__de	Wie willst du denn dein Steak haben? Englisch, medium oder durch?
__label__de	Das riecht aber gut! Was brutzelst du denn da?
__label__de	Warum weiterleben? Warum machen wir nicht einfach Schluss? Es hat doch ohnehin alles keinen Sinn.
__label__de	Das Telefon klingelt. Willst du nicht rangehen?
__label__de	Reg dich nicht auf! Mit dem Tom werden wir schon fertig!
__label__de	Im Augenblick ist es das Beste, wenn wir alles so lassen, wie es ist.
__label__de	Seit unserer Hochzeit haben wir nichts als Schwierigkeiten.
__label__de	Sei doch mal ruhig! Ich verstehe überhaupt nicht, was im Fernsehen gesagt wird.
__label__de	Vielleicht könnten wir uns darauf einigen, ein vernünftiges Gespräch zu führen; ich glaube nämlich nicht, dass uns der Austausch von Beleidigungen in der Sache wesentlich weiterbringt, Herr Koch.
__label__de	Nach Sonnenaufgang trinkt er Kaffee.
__label__de	Worum geht es dir eigentlich? Um den Mann oder ums Geld?
__label__de	Oma kocht noch altmodisch mit dem Kessel auf dem Ofen Wasser.
__label__de	Komm endlich vom Pott runter! Ich muss!
__label__de	Falls sich der Verdacht auf Salmonellen bestätigt, muss ich das Gesundheitsamt informieren.
__label__de	Irgend etwas müssen wir richtig gemacht haben, sonst würden nicht so viele Menschen mit uns verreisen.
__label__de	Das Beste muss nicht gut sein.
__label__de	Wieso hinten?
__label__de	Wieso vorne?
__label__de	Wer redet, ist nicht tot.
__label__de	Von dem dänischen Philosophen Kierkegaard stammt die Vorstellung, dass die Tür ins Reich des Glücks nach aussen aufgehe. Sie lässt sich nicht mit Gewalt aufstoßen, im Gegenteil: um sie zu öffnen, muss man sogar einen Schritt zurücktreten.
__label__de	Nicht Unglück, sondern Langeweile ist das Gegenteil von Glück.
__label__de	Aktivität ist der einfache, Abenteuer der besondere Weg zum Glück.
__label__de	Ich habe beide Städte besucht und beide haben übrigens eine romanische Kirche.
__label__de	Gibt es Regeln?
__label__de	Ich werde meine Frage präzisieren.
__label__de	Danke, vor allem für die Links.
__label__de	Wenn du das Fenster öffnest, musst du auch daran denken, es wieder zu schließen.
__label__de	Die Kinder sind von mir.
__label__de	Ich habe nichts Neues erfahren.
__label__de	Ich habe erfahren, was ich wollte.
__label__de	Er ist ein Niemand für mich.
__label__de	Ich habe das Geld, das ich bekam, für wenig gehalten.
__label__de	Im Schrank finde ich das nicht.
__label__de	Das ist zu wenig für mich.
__label__de	Die Strömung war ziemlich schnell.
__label__de	Wohnen Sie im Stadtzentrum?
__label__de	Die Pizza ist köstlich.
__label__de	Für mich ist der eine Null.
__label__de	Ich halte ihn für eine Null.
__label__de	Isst du keine Beilage dazu?
__label__de	Den ganzen Tag habe ich geflext.
__label__de	Ich bin nicht mehr hier.
__label__de	Wer bin ich für dich?
__label__de	Mit dreißig war ich noch jemand.
__label__de	Tom stieg aus dem Rettungswagen und lief weg.
__label__de	Ein neues Schuljahr stand kurz bevor.
__label__de	Es tut mir leid, dass das so lange gedauert hat.
__label__de	Entschuldige, dass das so lange gedauert hat!
__label__de	Die Menschen in meiner Geburtsstadt haben mich gekannt und gemocht.
__label__de	Diese Frau ist ein Niemand für mich.
__label__de	Die Schokolade ist im Auto geschmolzen.
__label__de	Während du geskyped hast, ist die Pizza kalt geworden.
__label__de	Ich habe das Wiener Schnitzel ohne alles gegessen.
__label__de	Ist er dein jüngerer oder älterer Bruder?
__label__de	Hier kann ich mit niemandem in meiner Muttersprache sprechen.
__label__de	Er ist es nicht.
__label__de	Dieses Wort kann ich nicht übersetzen.
__label__de	Hier die Bedeutung des Satzes.
__label__de	Auf dem Hauptplatz wird ein Galgen aufgestellt.
__label__de	Den Kontext habe ich verstanden.
__label__de	Ich brauche nur die Übersetzung dieses Wortes.
__label__de	Das Budget hat Löcher.
__label__de	Was machst du denn da in der Dunkelheit?
__label__de	Der Apfelsaft ist sehr lecker.
__label__de	Der Apfelsaft ist sehr schmackhaft.
__label__de	Sie rückte einen Stuhl vor.
__label__de	Ich bin Vegetarier, ich esse kein Fleisch.
__label__de	Ich bin Vegetarierin, ich esse kein Fleisch.
__label__de	Wir gratulieren Ihnen ganz herzlich!
__label__de	Mit allen Glückwünschen der Jury!
__label__de	„Kannst du mir helfen?“ – „Nicht jetzt!“
__label__de	Wir fahren schon seit einer Stunde im Kreis herum. Wo sind wir?
__label__de	Tom hat sich nicht den Fuß gebrochen, sondern den Arm.
__label__de	Nicht den Fuß hat sich Tom gebrochen, sondern den Arm.
__label__de	Möchtest du auch ein Stück Bienenstich? Seit ich schwanger bin, könnte ich mich an dem Zeug totfressen.
__label__de	„Wir reden über alles, nur nicht über uns.“ – „Ihr redet nicht über euch – das kenn’ ich!“
__label__de	Tom fand auf dem Küchentisch einen Zettel von Maria, auf dem stand: „Bin bei Elke.“
__label__de	„Für wen hast du dich denn so aufgedonnert? Doch wohl nicht für dieses Mauerblümchen Maria?“ – „Was dagegen?“
__label__de	„Hallo, Erna, mein Schatz! Magst du ein Stück Schokoladenkuchen? Ich habe heute früh einen gebacken.“ – „Au ja!“
__label__de	„Da! Lies!“ sagte Maria und warf Tom einen Brief auf den Küchentisch.
__label__de	Tom ist ein noch größeres Schwein, als ich dachte.
__label__de	Ich liebe Tom, und ich werde nicht dulden, dass du dich ständig zwischen uns stellst!
__label__de	Guten Tag, Herr Müller! Wir kennen uns ja bereits. Das hier ist der Herr Obergerichtsvollzieher Heinzelmann. Wir haben den Auftrag, Ihre Tochter Annika zu ihrer Mutter zu bringen.
__label__de	„5,99 Euro für eine Tasse Kaffee, 9,99 Euro für ein Stück Erdbeerkuchen und 99 Cent für die Schlagsahne. Nach Adam Riese macht das 16,97 Euro.“ – „Mit diesen ganzen Neunen können Sie den Wucher auch nicht verschleiern!“ – „Sie hätten ja nichts zu bestellen brauchen!“ – „Auch noch frech werden!“
__label__de	Es wäre hilfreich, wenn Sie uns sagen könnten, ob ein Tippfehler vorliegt oder ob Sie es absichtlich so geschrieben haben.
__label__de	Maria trug eine militärische Uniform; Tom war in Zivil.
__label__de	Ich habe Kopfschmerzen und keine Tabletten mehr im Haus.
__label__de	Warum steigen die Preise, nicht aber die Löhne?
__label__de	„Ist dieser Mensch mit Ihnen verwandt?“ – „Nein“, leugnete Maria, dabei war es ihr eigener Sohn.
__label__de	Tom kam wegen Befehlsverweigerung für 30 Jahre ins Gefängnis.
__label__de	Tom wurde wegen regierungskritischer Äußerungen sämtlicher Ämter enthoben und unter Hausarrest gestellt. Eine Woche später hatte er einen Unfall.
__label__de	Tom wurde denunziert und verschwand wenig später unter mysteriösen Umständen.
__label__de	Tom hatte Angst, selbst denunziert zu werden, und verriet seinen besten Freund.
__label__de	Tom hat seinen besten Freund ans Messer geliefert.
__label__de	„Wann hat denn das mit der Sauferei bei deiner Mutter eigentlich angefangen?“ – „Das hat schon angefangen, da war ich noch gar nicht geboren.“
__label__de	„Hörst du denn gar nichts mehr von Tom?“ – „Ich bin für den halt nicht so interessant wie die Jacqueline, weil er Französisch lernen will und nicht Deutsch.“
__label__de	Manchmal habe ich den Eindruck, dass mich Tom nicht ganz für voll nimmt.
__label__de	Wenn ich einen Hund hätte, würde ich ihn Tom nennen.
__label__de	Ich glaube, Tom hat mich, ohne dass ich es so richtig gemerkt habe, abserviert. Er lässt mich links liegen und schenkt anderen seine Aufmerksamkeit.
__label__de	Als Nachtisch gibt es Eiscreme.
__label__de	Nachdem man ihm die Kinder weggenommen hatte, stürzte Tom vollends ab.
__label__de	Wenn nur die Hälfte von dem stimmt, was die Leute so erzählen, dann schläft Eugenia mit dem Freund ihrer eigenen Mutter.
__label__de	Mein Vater und mein Onkel sind Brüder.
__label__de	Wieso sprecht ihr denn Englisch miteinander?
__label__de	Meine Tante hat keine Geschwister.
__label__de	Freundschaft ist eine Brücke zwischen den Welten, der verlorenen Seelen, im Meer der Zeit die Hoffnung vieler auf ein Licht in der Finsternis.
__label__de	Sie ist nicht meine Tante.
__label__de	Mit Tom hat man nichts als Scherereien.
__label__de	Die Erinnerung lässt sich nicht zum Schweigen bringen. Ich sorge immer dafür, dass ich an diesen Tagen vor lauter Arbeit überhaupt nicht zur Besinnung komme.
__label__de	Sind das echte Perlen oder falsche?
__label__de	Er meint, er hätte nichts Unrechtes getan.
__label__de	Du bist mein Enkel.
__label__de	Tom reiste durch Russland.
__label__de	Hinter dem Haus ist eine schöne Wildblumenwiese.
__label__de	Maria mag stinkende Männer in Arbeitskleidung.
__label__de	Wenn du hier bist und sprichst, kann ich mich nicht konzentrieren.
__label__de	Es gibt keinen Tag, an dem ich nicht an sie denke.
__label__de	Ich habe eine Schildkröte.
__label__de	Der Schmetterling ist ein Insekt.
__label__de	Das Huhn frisst einen Schmetterling.
__label__de	Der Adler frisst das Reptil.
__label__de	Ist der Löwe ein Säugetier?
__label__de	„Wie geht es denn Tom?“ – „Dem geht’s schlecht. Arbeitslos ist er und jeden Tag betrunken.“
__label__de	Im Jahre 2021 wurde an nur 36 % der weiterführenden Schulen in England Deutsch unterrichtet.
__label__de	Ich ziehe Socken an.
__label__de	Es ist zu schaffen, wenn du dich anstrengst.
__label__de	Manche Künstler behaupten, ihre Musik mit Hilfe von Klarträumen zu komponieren.
__label__de	Nein, er trägt nicht Ihre Kleidung.
__label__de	Tom hat heute einen Termin.
__label__de	Ein Weiser schätzt kein Spiel, wo nur der Zufall regieret.
__label__de	Der Langsamste, der sein Ziel nicht aus den Augen verliert, geht immer noch geschwinder als der, der ohne Ziel umherirrt.
__label__de	Was man nicht zu verlieren fürchtet, hat man zu besitzen nie geglaubt und nie gewünscht.
__label__de	Schreibe wie du redest, so schreibst du schön.
__label__de	Der Reiz ist Schönheit in Bewegung.
__label__de	Wo das Herz reden darf, braucht es keiner Vorbereitung.
__label__de	Hast du eine Luftmatratze?
__label__de	Maria hat sich für ihr neues Bett eine Matratzenauflage gekauft.
__label__de	Am Dienstag schaffe ich es aber nicht, pünktlich um 14 Uhr da zu sein.
__label__de	Da käme ich erst gegen 14.15 Uhr.
__label__de	„Ich bin zu faul, um aufzustehen. Hol mir mal ein Bier aus dem Kühlschrank.“ – „Das hättest du wohl gern!“
__label__de	Im nächsten Leben werde ich alles anders machen.
__label__de	Niemand will vom Tisch aufstehen.
__label__de	Hör auf zu heulen! So schlimm ist es auch wieder nicht!
__label__de	Für mich gibt es nichts Schlimmeres als Desinteresse.
__label__de	„Manchmal kann Tom so lieb sein!“ – „Das hast du mir jetzt schon zum drittenmal erzählst. Wenn du es mir gleich zum viertenmal sagst, heißt das nur, dass du es nötig hast, es dir immer wieder vorzusagen, damit du selber daran glauben kannst.“
__label__de	„Normalerweise würde ich mich jetzt über dich aufregen, aber ich tu’s nicht.“ – „So? Und warum nicht?“ – „Weil du vielleicht doch recht hast.“
__label__de	Ob uns die anderen mögen, ist nicht so wichtig; wichtig ist vor allem, dass wir uns liebhaben.
__label__de	„Mama?“ – „Ja? Ist was?“ – „Kannst du mal kommen?“
__label__de	„Ich möchte zu Papa.“ – „Daraus wird nichts. Schlag dir das aus dem Kopf! Ich habe das Sorgerecht für dich und nicht dein Vater.“
__label__de	Draußen ruft ständig ein kleines Mädchen nach seiner Mutter.
__label__de	Warum lässt sich Maria auf einen Mann ein, der von sich selbst sagt, dass er nicht treu sein kann?
__label__de	Warum lässt sich Maria auf einen Mann ein, von dem sie genau weiß, dass er nicht treu sein kann?
__label__de	Die Maria, die kann einem wirklich leid tun!
__label__de	Ich habe allen gesagt, sie sollten vorsichtig sein.
__label__de	Dieses Gericht reicht für uns beide.
__label__de	Leider wurde dieser Begriff nicht übernommen.
__label__de	Danke für diese ausführliche Antwort.
__label__de	Tom fing sich eine ein, als er Maria küssen wollte.
__label__de	Ich bin ein wenig verwirrt.
__label__de	Stell keine Fragen.
__label__de	Ich bin morgen nicht zu Hause.
__label__de	Das ist kein Frieden. Das ist ein Waffenstillstand auf zwanzig Jahre.
__label__de	Bitte haltet euer Klassenzimmer sauber!
__label__de	Macht das Sinn?
__label__de	Er spielt Bridge.
__label__de	Den Führerschein und die Fahrzeugpapiere bitte.
__label__de	Hast du deine Eltern rumgekriegt?
__label__de	Es gibt, Gott sei Dank, auch mal angenehme Überraschungen.
__label__de	„Verpetz mich bitte nicht!“ – „Was krieg’ ich dafür?“
__label__de	Ihr könnt hier nicht wohnen bleiben.
__label__de	Ich möchte gerne hier in diesem Haus wohnen bleiben.
__label__de	Tom und Johannes pflegen seit einer Lappalie, deren Einzelheiten beide längst vergessen haben, ihre Feindschaft.
__label__de	Dieses Land ist verloren. Jetzt gnade uns Gott.
__label__de	Zu einem großen Mann gehört beides: Kleinigkeiten als Kleinigkeiten und wichtige Dinge als wichtige Dinge zu behandeln.
__label__de	Zärtliche Küsse!
__label__de	Der mitleidigste Mensch ist der beste Mensch.
__label__de	Der wahre Virtuose spottet bei sich über jede uneingeschränkte Bewunderung, und nur das Lob desjenigen kitzelt ihn, von dem er weiß, daß er auch das Herz hat, ihn zu tadeln.
__label__de	Kann man denn nicht auch lachend sehr ernsthaftig sein?
__label__de	Der Endzweck der Wissenschaft ist Wahrheit. Der Endzweck der Künste hingegen ist Vergnügen.
__label__de	Gute Einfälle sind Geschenke des Glücks.
__label__de	Es gibt gewisse Dinge, wo ein Frauenzimmer immer schärfer sieht als hundert Augen der Mannesperson.
__label__de	Ein guter Einfall ist wie ein Hahn am Morgen: Gleich krähen andere Hähne mit.
__label__de	Wie hört sich das hier an?
__label__de	Tom hat Mary erzählt, dass John und Alice gerne Schach spielen.
__label__de	Was hältst du von meiner neuen Wohnung?
__label__de	Tom wurde streng bestraft.
__label__de	Wie viel ist er älter als du?
__label__de	Für Kriege brauchen Politiker Menschen, die statt ihnen kämpfen und ihr Leben geben, und ihr Geld, damit sie die Kriege finanzieren können.
__label__de	Mir ist langweilig. Ich weiß nicht, was ich machen soll.
__label__de	Ich sah lange zu, wie sie die Wäsche aufhing.
__label__de	Sie spielt mit meinen Gefühlen.
__label__de	Teile es in zwei gleiche Teile!
__label__de	So viel Geld kann man nicht auf anständige Weise zusammenraffen.
__label__de	Tom ist ein Unmensch.
__label__de	Er würde sich im Grab umdrehen, wenn er es sehen könnte.
__label__de	Ich kann morgen gehen.
__label__de	Wenn Tom gesagt hat, dass er kommt, dann kommt er auch.
__label__de	Ich denke, dafür gibt es viele Gründe.
__label__de	Die Arbeiten an der Straße begannen am 11. September 1935 im Bundesstaat North Carolina.
__label__de	Der Verteidiger versuchte, die Zeugin in Misskredit zu bringen.
__label__de	Der Verteidigerin versuchte, den Zeugen in Misskredit zu bringen.
__label__de	Wie viele Tiere haben Sie?
__label__de	Wie viele Tiere hast du?
__label__de	Was ist die Antwort?
__label__de	Wem gehört das Kind?
__label__de	Tom spielte „Alle meine Entchen“ auf dem Klavier.
__label__de	„Soll ich dir einen Kaffee kochen?“ – „Nein, danke.“ – „Aber ein bisschen Musik darf ich auflegen, oder?“
__label__de	Wie hieß dein Großvater?
__label__de	Die Aber kosten Überlegung.
__label__de	Nur die Sache ist verloren, die man selbst aufgibt.
__label__de	Es wäre wenig in der Welt unternommen worden, wenn man immer nur auf den Ausgang gesehen hätte.
__label__de	Welche Freude, wenn es heißt: Alter, du bist alt an Haaren, blühend aber ist dein Geist.
__label__de	Gestern liebt’ ich, / heute leid’ ich, / morgen sterb’ ich: / dennoch denk’ ich / heut’ und morgen / gern an gestern.
__label__de	Seine Worte gehen mir nicht aus dem Kopf.
__label__de	Diese Worte gehen mir nicht aus dem Kopf.
__label__de	Manchmal hört man, was man hören will.
__label__de	Manchmal liest man, was man lesen will.
__label__de	Ich höre hier auch, dass sie streiten.
__label__de	Ich höre hier nicht, was du sagst.
__label__de	Hier kann man es nicht hören.
__label__de	Wen kennen Sie in Boston?
__label__de	Wen kennst du in Boston?
__label__de	In der niederländischen Stadt Maastricht soll es 53 Kirchen geben; einige davon werden inzwischen als Läden, Cafés oder Museen genutzt.
__label__de	Tom wohnt unter der Brücke – auch in der Winterkälte – und isst Käfer, die er findet, und er ist trotzdem glücklich.
__label__de	Trotz aller ideologischer Vorsätze wollen die Leute nicht auf ihren Komfort verzichten.
__label__de	Hat es Sinn, das Land von weltfremden Politikern regieren zu lassen?
__label__de	Während der Massenquarantäne im Jahre 2020 gab der isländische Pianist Víkingur Ólafsson eine Reihe wöchentlicher Konzerte vor dem leeren Konzerthaus Harpa in Reykjavík.
__label__de	„Ich habe Tom die Unterlagen gestern geschickt. Jetzt heißt es abwarten, bis wir von ihm hören.“ – „Wie lange kann das dauern?“ – „Bisher hat er immer innerhalb von 14 Tagen geantwortet.“
__label__de	Nachdem Maria mit der Mondscheinsonate fertig war, setzte sich als nächster Tom an den Flügel und spielte mit einem Finger „Alle meine Entchen“. Das war natürlich ein Scherz.
__label__de	Tom ist der Witzigere der beiden, Maria die Ernstere.
__label__de	Tom ist immer zu einem Scherz aufgelegt.
__label__de	Tom macht gerne Spaß.
__label__de	Liebst du deinen Hund nicht?
__label__de	Lieben Sie Ihren Hund nicht?
__label__de	Liebt ihr euren Hund nicht?
__label__de	Er hat die gleichen verschmitzten Augen wie sein Großvater.
__label__de	Es wird so etwas länger dauern.
__label__de	Ich habe dich so lange nicht gesehen.
__label__de	Man kann aus Meerwasser Trinkwasser machen.
__label__de	Meinen Gefühlen kann ich nicht befehlen.
__label__de	Ich habe mich selbst auch angelogen.
__label__de	Ich habe auch die Lüge geglaubt.
__label__de	Ich erinnere mich an einen; den anderen habe ich vergessen.
__label__de	Erinnerst du dich noch an Tom aus Boston?
__label__de	An den Namen der einen erinnere ich mich noch, an den der anderen nicht.
__label__de	Lang lebe der König.
__label__de	„Tom hat an Sagittarius A ein Staubsaugerrohr gesteckt, und die Politiker eingesaugt.“ – „Tom ist ein echter Held! Lang lebe er!“
__label__de	Ich glaube an die Menschheit.
__label__de	Ich habe meinen Glauben an die Menschheit verloren.
__label__de	Ich spiele montags oft mit Tom, Maria und Johannes Karten.
__label__de	Um wieviel Uhr endet die Pause?
__label__de	Um wieviel Uhr fängt die Pause an?
__label__de	Wie viele Minuten dauert die Pause?
__label__de	Wie lang ist die große Pause?
__label__de	Die Pause dauert zehn Minuten.
__label__de	Die große Pause dauert 20 Minuten.
__label__de	Das ist ein annähernd zehn Jahre altes Foto von ihr.
__label__de	„Tom hat unser ganzes Konto leergeräumt und sich vom Acker gemacht.“ – „Was machen wir denn jetzt?“ – „Frag mich was Leichteres!“
__label__de	Sind Tom und Mary ein Ehepaar?
__label__de	Sibirien ist ein wunderschönes Land.
__label__de	„Wem gibst du recht? Tom oder Johannes?“ – „Ehrlich gesagt, finde ich sie alle beide blöd.“
__label__de	Er wird den ganzen Tag arbeiten müssen.
__label__de	Es nervte Tom, dass er gestört wurde.
__label__de	Tom und Maria blieben nach der Trennung befreundet.
__label__de	Nach einer Weile fing Tom an, seine eigenen Lügen zu glauben.
__label__de	Maria hat einen Doktorgrad inne.
__label__de	Sie kann das ebenso gut wie du.
__label__de	Sie kann das ebenso gut wie ihr.
__label__de	Sie kann das ebenso gut wie Sie.
__label__de	Wann heiratest du ihn?
__label__de	Sie schien sich erst zu fürchten, aber nur für einen Augenblick.
__label__de	Den Wahnsinn haben die Leute in diesem Land noch immer im Blut, nur dass er sich heute anders ausdrückt als früher.
__label__de	Das ist meine Traumküche.
__label__de	Sicherheit ist wichtig.
__label__de	Sie sah sehr süß aus.
__label__de	Ich werde mich davon nicht vom Lernen ablenken lassen.
__label__de	Tom war sich nicht sicher, ob Maria das, was sie gesagt, wirklich so gemeint hatte.
__label__de	Ich bin romantisch nicht an ihm interessiert.
__label__de	Steht er wirklich auf mich?
__label__de	Gefalle ich ihm wirklich?
__label__de	Tom heiratete Maria, nachdem deren Mann gestorben war.
__label__de	Tom hat das Wort mit N benutzt.
__label__de	Als „bucket list“ bezeichnet man eine Liste von Dingen, die man noch machen will, bevor man den Löffel abgibt.
__label__de	Maria verabschiedete sich von Tom.
__label__de	Nach der Trennung blieben sie befreundet.
__label__de	Ebendas mag ich an ihm.
__label__de	Von hier aus kann ich nicht erkennen, was das ist.
__label__de	Wenn der Herr Bäcker nicht so schnell bei Ihnen gewesen wäre, lägen Sie jetzt nicht hier im Bett, sondern sähen sich die Radieschen von unten an.
__label__de	Warum darüber streiten, was wir sind, wenn wir nicht einmal wissen, wer wir sind.
__label__de	Erst die Vielfalt der Dinge ermöglicht uns, über Individuelles zu sprechen, und bringt die Einzigartigkeit zur Geltung.
__label__de	Liebe fordert und erwartet nicht.
__label__de	Vom Menschen hat man das Unerwartete zu erwarten und man sollte darauf vorbereitet sein.
__label__de	Kämpfen für den Frieden ist wie schreien für Stille.
__label__de	Die Menschen sind nicht immer was sie scheinen, doch selten etwas besseres.
__label__de	Der Erfolg von heute ist morgen schon wieder die Herausforderung.
__label__de	Die Qualität deines Lebens ist abhängig von deinem Handeln.
__label__de	Wo auch immer es Wirkungen gibt, da gibt es auch Risiken und Nebenwirkungen.
__label__de	Sei dir deiner inneren Quelle bewusst, du bist als leuchtender Stern geboren, deine Berufung ist es zu scheinen.
__label__de	Sobald uns etwas gelungen ist, überstürzen sich die Beweise, warum es uns gelingen musste.
__label__de	Alles sprach gegen seinen Erfolg.
__label__de	Er ist dein Neffe, nicht wahr?
__label__de	„Danke!” - „Gern geschehen!”
__label__de	Tschüss und gute Nacht.
__label__de	Es ist freundliches Wetter.
__label__de	Er ging hinaus und kam niemals zurück.
__label__de	Komm du auch!
__label__de	Sie sind Mann und Frau.
__label__de	Wir fahren in einer Fahrgemeinschaft zur Arbeit.
__label__de	Das steht nicht im Auftrag.
__label__de	Er spricht gut Griechisch und ein wenig Englisch.
__label__de	Wir wohnen seit fünfzehn Jahren zur Miete.
__label__de	Mangroven nehmen mehr Kohlendioxid auf als alle anderen Bäume der Welt, denn ihre unterirdische Wurzelstruktur ist sehr groß.
__label__de	Wir fahren von A nach B.
__label__de	Ich weiß nicht einmal, was das bedeutet.
__label__de	Hast du dich mit Tom gestritten oder was?
__label__de	Die wollen heiraten.
__label__de	Wenn du nicht reden willst, musst du nicht.
__label__de	Die, die der Regierung immer noch glauben, müssen echt blöd sein.
__label__de	Du hast mich gar nicht verstanden!
__label__de	Wir haben die Wohnung auf Kredit gekauft.
__label__de	Wie viele Menschen hat die Heilige Inquisition getötet?
__label__de	Konservierungsstoffe töten das Lebendige.
__label__de	Nicht ich wollte es.
__label__de	Wenn ich es nicht mache, dann macht es niemand.
__label__de	Wer versteht das? Ich nicht.
__label__de	Sie haben gestritten und es fiel eine schallende Ohrfeige.
__label__de	Ich sah sie lange an, während sie die Kleider aufhing.
__label__de	„Rauchst du eine mit?“ – „Sehe ich so aus, als wäre ich blöd?“
__label__de	Tom steckte sich die Bibel, seine Lesebrille und einen Kugelschreiber in den Bart.
__label__de	Dieser Tom ist doch ein schlauer Kerl.
__label__de	Früher waren Bauern „smart“, nicht ihre Gerätschaften.
__label__de	Die Betonbauten und dazu die Styropordämmung sind vielleicht der größte Feind der Umwelt.
__label__de	Der Weiße Riese und Rotkäppchen gingen nach Grünburg, um die Gelbe Hexe zu treffen.
__label__de	O Gott, von wie vielen Blöden bin ich umgegeben!
__label__de	Falafel sind reich an Eiweiß.
__label__de	Tom hat einen leichten deutschen Akzent.
__label__de	Ist die Tür offen oder geschlossen?
__label__de	Sie haben ihre Beziehung geheimgehalten.
__label__de	Na gut! Wenn du hierbleibst, dann gehe ich weg.
__label__de	Ich hänge seit Tagen einem Problem nach.
__label__de	Tom rutschte aus und fiel vom Rand des Sandkastens.
__label__de	Seine Frage überraschte mich.
__label__de	Die Ferien gingen viel zu schnell vorüber, und die Schule begann wieder.
__label__de	Ich weiß, dass du mich nicht allzusehr magst.
__label__de	In Italien geht es mit dem Profifußball weiter.
__label__de	Tom sah wie ein trauriger Welpe aus.
__label__de	Toms Posteingang ist voll.
__label__de	Dem Schauspieler fiel sein Text nicht ein.
__label__de	Tom konnte seinen Text nicht.
__label__de	Das ist doch kein dickes Buch!
__label__de	In Alaska wird es wärmer, schneller als in jedem anderen Bundesstaat und bisher doppelt so schnell wie im weltweiten Durchschnitt seit Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts.
__label__de	Es hat mich zuerst verwirrt.
__label__de	Die Raumzeit ist um den Pulsar herum so verzerrt, dass Licht von der uns abgewandten Seite „gekrümmt“ und in unser Blickfeld abgelenkt wird.
__label__de	Entschuldigen Sie, geht es Ihnen gut?
__label__de	Wir sahen uns an und sagten: „Was machen wir denn jetzt?“
__label__de	Entschuldigung, geht es Ihnen gut?
__label__de	Kümmere dich nicht um mich, Tom. Mach einfach weiter.
__label__de	Es gibt nichts, was ich gerade lieber täte.
__label__de	Aristarch von Samos glaubte, dass die Sonne der Mittelpunkt des Universums sei und dass sich die Erde um sie drehe.
__label__de	Vergewissern Sie sich, dass die Feststell- und die Num-Taste nicht versehentlich gedrückt sind. Bei Ihrem Passwort wird zwischen Groß- und Kleinschreibung unterschieden.
__label__de	In der Zukunft wird niemand Auto fahren.
__label__de	Ich bin ihr egal. Du bist’s, der sie interessiert.
__label__de	Tom und Maria luden alle ihre Freunde ein.
__label__de	Ich mache gerne Nachtisch.
__label__de	Das ist ein Beispiel, dem man folgen sollte.
__label__de	Du hast es nicht geschafft, den wesentlichen Punkt zu erfassen, was?
__label__de	Womit spielt ihr?
__label__de	Dieses Fleisch stinkt.
__label__de	Hat jemand Pizza bestellt?
__label__de	Tom hat eine sehr lange Liste mit Vokabeln auswendig gelernt.
__label__de	Beachte ihn gar nicht, Tom. Der ist nur neidisch.
__label__de	Bleib dir selber treu.
__label__de	Einen Bagel bitte.
__label__de	Tom bat Maria, still zu sitzen.
__label__de	Tom hörte höflich zu.
__label__de	Maria ist ein sensibles Mädchen.
__label__de	Du hast nicht auf die Frage geantwortet.
__label__de	Eine wahrheitsgemäße Berichterstattung beruht auf überprüfbaren Fakten.
__label__de	Was hält er von all dem?
__label__de	Die Antwort ist jein.
__label__de	Erlauben Sie mir, mit einer kurzen Geschichte auf die Frage zu antworten.
__label__de	Rhetorik ist die Kunst, Lügen glaubhaft zu machen.
__label__de	Gut, oder?
__label__de	Das heißt Präzisität.
__label__de	Sie hat nicht einmal meinen Namen gewusst.
__label__de	Hast du Maria schon geküsst?
__label__de	Er wollte mich zum Lachen bringen.
__label__de	Tom zog alle Schrauben an.
__label__de	Du bist entweder sehr mutig oder aber sehr töricht.
__label__de	Tom schlich sich von hinten an mich heran und schubste mich in das Schwimmbecken.
__label__de	Der Hund der Nachbarn ist gestorben.
__label__de	Der Nachbarshund ist gestorben.
__label__de	Tom hatte gestern Fieber.
__label__de	Tom hatte Fieber.
__label__de	Ich wünschte, ich könnte dich zum Geburtstag einmal drücken.
__label__de	Ich fahre morgen mit dem Bus nach Boston.
__label__de	Damals bin ich eher ins Bett gegangen.
__label__de	Diese Sendung kommt jede Woche.
__label__de	Ich glaube Tom nicht mehr.
__label__de	Ich wünschte, ich könnte so schnell einschlafen wie du.
__label__de	Tom macht jeden Abend einen Dauerlauf.
__label__de	Vielen Dank, dass ihr heute da seid!
__label__de	Vielen Dank, dass du heute da bist!
__label__de	Vielen Dank, dass Sie heute da sind!
__label__de	Das Angebot ist verlockend.
__label__de	Das Angebot war verlockend.
__label__de	Tom spricht ständig Französisch.
__label__de	Tom hat seine Dissertation auf Französisch geschrieben.
__label__de	Ich bin müde und kann mich nicht konzentrieren.
__label__de	Ich bin müde und kann mich nicht mehr konzentrieren.
__label__de	Ich bin ein Engel.
__label__de	Toms Witz war zum Totlachen.
__label__de	Der Witz, den Tom erzählt hat, war zum Totlachen.
__label__de	Toms Hund war angeleint.

__label__de	Tom schrie den Kellner an.
__label__de	Ich bekomme so langsam Hunger. Wie sieht’s bei dir aus?
__label__de	Tom wurde von einer Scharfschützin erschossen.
__label__de	Tom wurde von einem Scharfschützen erschossen.
__label__de	Tom muss die Hecke schneiden.
__label__de	Tom schnitt gerade seine Hecke.
__label__de	Tom errötete vor Scham.
__label__de	Das kann Tom nicht gesagt haben.
__label__de	Ich möchte mich gerne morgen oder übermorgen mit dir treffen.
__label__de	Ich möchte mich, wenn möglich, gerne morgen früh mit dir treffen.
__label__de	Ich möchte mich gerne übermorgen statt morgen mit dir treffen.
__label__de	Ich weiß nicht mehr, wie ich hierhergekommen bin.
__label__de	Es ist entspannend, im Gras zu liegen und den Wolken dabei zuzusehen, wie sie vorüberziehen.
__label__de	Wir haben uns heute Nachmittag lange und nett unterhalten.
__label__de	Komm bitte mal kurz her!
__label__de	Wie viele Passagiere wurden gerettet?
__label__de	Tom hat uns drei Stunden warten lassen.
__label__de	Heute ist der letzte Tag des Monats.
__label__de	Herr Hansen hat einen Schüler aus dem Unterricht geworfen.
__label__de	Den Rest des Weges müssen wir zu Fuß gehen.
__label__de	Früher bin ich oft zelten gegangen.
__label__de	Das Museum ist auf der anderen Straßenseite.
__label__de	Herr Hansen hat eine Schülerin aus dem Unterricht geworfen.
__label__de	Herr Hansen wird von seinen Schülern terrorisiert.
__label__de	Wir wollen ins Kino. Willst du mit?
__label__de	Maria äußerte die Vermutung, dass sich Tom in einen Mann verliebt habe, weil für ihn keine Frau dem Vergleich mit seiner Mutter standhalte.
__label__de	Ich habe den Eindruck, dass Tom autistisch veranlagt ist.
__label__de	Bald ist schon wieder Weihnachten.
__label__de	Von allen Blöden hier ist Tom der Blödeste.
__label__de	In der Politik wimmelt es von Blöden.
__label__de	Der eine ist hier blöder als der andere.
__label__de	Auf einen Klugen kommen zehn Blöde, die ihn mundtot machen.
__label__de	Die Blöden schreien lauter als die Klugen und werden somit nur allein gehört.
__label__de	Wie können wir verhindern, dass die Blöden in der Politik noch mehr Schaden anrichten?
__label__de	Schmieren und Salben helfen allenthalben.
__label__de	Ist der Blick gehoben, so sieht man keine Grenzen.
__label__de	Welche Freiheit meinen wir, wenn uns in geschlossenen Räumen Wohlbefinden überkommt?
__label__de	Wir sind gerade noch mit dem Leben davongekommen.
__label__de	Die Schaffung der implantierbaren Chips und die Abschaffung des Bargelds sind nur Verschwörungstheorien.
__label__de	Tom stieg ins Auto und jagte davon.
__label__de	Das Leben ist zu kurz, um sich das Geschehen aus der zweiten Reihe anzuschauen.
__label__de	Ein Vielleicht deutet Entscheidungsschwäche an.
__label__de	Zuhause ist wo dein Herz ist.
__label__de	Lebe deinen Sommer so, dass er dich auch noch im Winter wärmt.
__label__de	Wahres Wissen spiegelt sich in deinen täglichen Handlungen wieder.
__label__de	Heute ist das Leben nicht das, was du gestern vorgefunden hast. Morgen wird das Leben nicht das sein, was du heute hinterlassen hast.
__label__de	Greif nicht in ein Wespennest, doch, wenn du greifst, so greife fest.
__label__de	Andere verstehen das nicht, nur wir.
__label__de	Gibst du mir das?
__label__de	Tom hat mit WIG schön schweißen gelernt, bis er die Zähne verloren hat.
__label__de	Sie schweißt schön, ohne Witz! Schau dir mal ihre Nähte an!
__label__de	Die Wirtschaft stürzt ab wie das World Trade Center.
__label__de	In Afrika leben bestimmt die Glücklichsten: die, die nichts haben.
__label__de	Lebt ihr zusammen?
__label__de	Ich war zu faul, hausgemachte zuzubereiten, also habe ich welche im Laden gekauft.
__label__de	Wie könnte man dies am besten übersetzen?
__label__de	Was ist das für ein Rechtsgebiet?
__label__de	Die folgenden Daten wurden öffentlich zugänglich gemacht.
__label__de	Die Isländer sind Feen.
__label__de	Sie ist ein echtes Wunder.
__label__de	Ich weiß nicht mehr, wie ich dorthin gekommen bin.
__label__de	Geh jetzt, bevor es zu spät ist!
__label__de	Geht jetzt, bevor es zu spät ist!
__label__de	Gehen Sie jetzt, bevor es zu spät ist!
__label__de	Das ist eine sehr naive Frage.
__label__de	„Könnt ihr nicht woanders spielen?“ fragte Maria die Kinder. „Bei dem Lärm, den ihr macht, kann man sich nicht konzentrieren.“ – „Gehen Sie doch woanders hin!“ gaben ihr die Kinder zur Antwort.
__label__de	Dem wird das Lachen noch vergehen.
__label__de	Auf Sardinien verbrannten 20 000 Hektar Wald, und Hunderte Menschen mussten evakuiert werden.
__label__de	Sie ist Wellenreiterin.
__label__de	Sie ist Surferin.
__label__de	Tom ist mit dem Rucksack auf Wanderschaft gegangen.
__label__de	Das ist doch wohl ein Witz.
__label__de	„Du siehst sehr müde aus.“ – „Nein, Mama, mir geht’s gut.“
__label__de	Die Schule langweilte Tom.
__label__de	Er hat dich also geküsst?
__label__de	Den Strand säumten Palmen.
__label__de	Diese Waschmaschine befüllt man von oben.
__label__de	Der Atlantik ist nur knapp größer als der halbe Pazifik.
__label__de	Sie blickte hinab und sah, dass ihr Fischschwanz verschwunden war.
__label__de	Manchmal ist es schwer zu erkennen, wann Tom es ernst meint.
__label__de	In Griechenland spreche ich Griechisch.
__label__de	Sie werden die Opposition ausschalten.
__label__de	Haben Sie das auch in Größe M?
__label__de	Der Jeep rumpelte durch ein Schlagloch nach dem anderen.
__label__de	Der Mann kam mit einer Zigarette in der Hand auf mich zu, und ich wusste sofort: Er wollte Feuer.
__label__de	Abgesehen von einem rostigen Rohr war das Netz leer.
__label__de	Während wir in die Grube einfuhren, grübelte ich darüber nach, ob ich mir nicht doch besser eine Arbeit an der Oberfläche suchen sollte.
__label__de	Immer, wenn Tom eine Versammlung einberuft, ist es nichts als Zeitverschwendung.
__label__de	Warum ist Jane zum Bahnhof gefahren?
__label__de	Tom wollte Marias Zuneigung gewinnen.
__label__de	In Italien hat man Ärzte im Ruhestand gebeten, den Dienst wiederaufzunehmen, um bei der Behandlung vom Coronavirus Betroffener zu helfen.
__label__de	Gleichmäßig durch die Nase ein- und wieder ausatmen!
__label__de	Sind die Geschenke eingepackt?
__label__de	Tom und sein Bruder haben in derselben Mannschaft gespielt, aber nicht zur selben Zeit.
__label__de	Warum bist du denn ganz nass?
__label__de	Warum seid ihr denn ganz nass?
__label__de	Warum sind Sie denn ganz nass?
__label__de	Alle halfen einander.
__label__de	Ein Polizist stand mit dem Notizbuch in der Hand neben uns.
__label__de	Vorsicht! Es ist scharf.
__label__de	Ich dachte, Tom hätte mich genauso gern wie ich ihn.
__label__de	Sprich nicht so mit ihr! Sie ist meine Freundin.
__label__de	Ist Herr Dr. Müller-Schwab zu sprechen? Es wäre wichtig.
__label__de	„Willst du auch ein Bier?“ – „Gerne.“
__label__de	Die Regierung arbeitet intensiv, um das Land und die Bevölkerung kaputtzumachen.
__label__de	Sie sieht immer noch sehr gut aus.
__label__de	Zuerst muss das Individuum reformiert werden, erst dann kann sich eine neue Gesellschaft bilden.
__label__de	Ich bin, dadurch werde ich.
__label__de	Nur ein freier Geist tritt dem Leben schöpferisch entgegen.
__label__de	Je leiser du wirst, desto mehr kannst du hören.
__label__de	Wer keinen Sinn für Humor hat, wird in diesem Land nie irgend etwas erreichen.
__label__de	Sie hat das Haus vor drei Monaten verkauft.
__label__de	Die Morgensonne beleuchtete es.
__label__de	Die Morgensonne hat sie beleuchtet.
__label__de	Die Freiheit braucht Menschen, die noch ihre Eier haben und zu denken fähig sind.
__label__de	Der Regen verdeckt den ganzen Berg.
__label__de	Den ganzen Tag läufst du hinaus und herein.
__label__de	Eine Lampe beleuchtete von der Seite ihr Gesicht.
__label__de	Warum hat die Schule mir nichts gesagt?
__label__de	Du bist immer noch die Schönste.
__label__de	Du bist immer noch die schönste.
__label__de	Sie ist bestimmt über 40, aber ich weiß nicht genau.
__label__de	Ich bin’s, Tom.
__label__de	Das konnte man nicht missverstehen.
__label__de	Das war das erste und letzte Mal, dass ich ihm geholfen habe.
__label__de	Sie konnte mich nicht sehen.
__label__de	Ich habe ihn doch gesehen.
__label__de	Ich habe ihn nur von hinten gesehen.
__label__de	Ich bin zwar nicht schlau, aber blöd auch nicht.
__label__de	Ziehst du das Baby an?
__label__de	Wir küssten uns im Mondlicht.
__label__de	Der Mond leuchtete.
__label__de	Der Mond ist heute außergewöhnlich groß.
__label__de	Heute scheint der Mond außergewöhnlich groß zu sein.
__label__de	Tom speichert die Wärme für den Winter in Säcken.
__label__de	Tom ist ein Clown.
__label__de	Sie wuchs in einem Haushalt auf, in dem immer Musik lief.
__label__de	Das macht Spaß. Das müssen wir mal wieder tun.
__label__de	Der Fisch ist klein.
__label__de	Ich trinke Tee mit Zitrone.
__label__de	Tom holte seine Verlobte ab, um sie zum Abendessen auszuführen.
__label__de	Was kann das heißen?
__label__de	Das ist die wortwörtliche Übersetzung!
__label__de	Tom hat ein scheußliches Verbrechen begangen.
__label__de	Ich habe keine Ahnung, was das sein könnte.
__label__de	Das Mittagessen ist Pizza.
__label__de	Knoblauch ist keine Frucht.
__label__de	Der Programmierer hat den Fehler gefunden.
__label__de	Die Programmiererin hat den Fehler gefunden.
__label__de	Der Tanz fand in der Schulturnhalle statt.
__label__de	Mein Freund da drüben ist echt schüchtern, aber er findet dich süß und würde gerne mal mit dir reden.
__label__de	Schweizer Banken sind sehr verschwiegen.
__label__de	Tom lebt in einem schlechten Teil der Stadt.
__label__de	Gib mir die Taschenlampe.
__label__de	Geben Sie mir die Taschenlampe.
__label__de	Tom wollte Marys Nachnamen wissen.
__label__de	Das glaubst du wirklich, oder?
__label__de	Ja, genau, Sie haben recht.
__label__de	Warum sind Sie Busfahrer geworden?
__label__de	Snoop Dogg ist der berühmteste Grasraucher der Welt.
__label__de	Überprüf, ob alles vorhanden ist.
__label__de	Dein Vater wäre sehr stolz auf dich.
__label__de	Sie haben einen hohen Schwierigkeitsgrad gewählt.
__label__de	Das sind die Magazine meiner Schwester.
__label__de	Mary trägt ein Pfefferspray in ihrer Handtasche.
__label__de	Ich habe viele Bekannte, die kein Fleisch essen.
__label__de	Wer hat dich dazu angehalten, mir das zu sagen?
__label__de	Ich hab mit meinem Freund gestritten.
__label__de	Exportiert Deutschland Getreide?
__label__de	Ich habe ihnen gesagt, dass ich darüber nachdenken würde.
__label__de	Egal was passiert, ich werde nicht aufgeben.
__label__de	Ich habe meinen Computer repariert.
__label__de	Er trinkt jeden Tag.
__label__de	Hast du sie irgendwo gesehen?
__label__de	Ich habe eine Notiz hinterlassen.
__label__de	Sie hat mir ein für alle Mal gesagt, dass sie mich nicht mehr sehen will.
__label__de	Du kannst seine Bibliothek benutzen.
__label__de	Wir haben gute Nachrichten.
__label__de	Ich trinke viel Kaffee.
__label__de	Der Pfirsich ist eine schmackhafte Frucht.
__label__de	Das Baby ist ein Mädchen.
__label__de	Deine Mutter ist mit mir verwandt.
__label__de	Mein Vater ist ihr Sohn.
__label__de	Wir müssen nicht alles machen, aber das, was wir machen, müssen wir perfekt machen.
__label__de	Wir müssen aus den Fehlern anderer lernen; denn wir leben nicht lange genug, um alle Fehler selber zu machen.
__label__de	Ein Weiser gibt nicht die richtigen Antworten, sondern er stellt die richtigen Fragen.
__label__de	Tom führt ein chaotisches Leben.
__label__de	Das würde hier am besten passen.
__label__de	Tom muss mehreren Aktivitäten zur gleichen Zeit nachgehen.
__label__de	Könnte mir jemand helfen?
__label__de	Sind Sie damit zufrieden?
__label__de	Die Milch macht stark.
__label__de	Die Milch stärkt.
__label__de	Einen Teelöffel bitte.
__label__de	Brechen Sie die Schokoladentafel in kleine Stücke.
__label__de	Der Vortrag hat viele Themen behandelt.
__label__de	Ist es deine Schuld oder unsere?
__label__de	Du und ich sind keine Geschwister.
__label__de	Ihre Worte waren völlig unsinnig.
__label__de	Tom ging, ohne die Rechnung zu bezahlen.
__label__de	Er war ein sehr muslimischer Typ.
__label__de	Geh in deinem eigenen Zimmer schlafen.
__label__de	Sie schlich sich von hinten an ihn an.
__label__de	Sie hat sich von hinten an ihn angeschlichen.
__label__de	Tom konnte nicht finden, was er brauchte.
__label__de	Wenn Tom und Mary mehr Zeit hätten, würden sie das tun.
__label__de	Ich habe Tom ermutigt, öfter Sport zu treiben.
__label__de	Es ist ein schönes Bild.
__label__de	Du hast keine Ahnung, wie man vor Publikum auftritt.
__label__de	Ich werde ihm Bescheid geben, dass du hier bist.
__label__de	Der Bus wird in drei Minuten hier sein.
__label__de	Ich wusste auch nicht, dass Sie hierher kommen würden.
__label__de	Tom hatte das Gefühl, geliebt zu werden.
__label__de	Tom wollte nirgendwo hingehen.
__label__de	Sie ist gerade aus dem Ausland zurückgekehrt.
__label__de	Wir reden immer mit ihnen.
__label__de	Aber Tom hat es verdächtig gefunden.
__label__de	Tom hat einen Roman geschrieben.
__label__de	Er schaut.
__label__de	Er beobachtet.
__label__de	Bevorzugst du Tee oder Kaffee?
__label__de	Ich habe dieses Buch vor einigen Jahren gelesen.
__label__de	Tom sagt, er hat nicht vor, morgen zu gehen.
__label__de	Du musst ihn ermutigen, es noch einmal zu versuchen.
__label__de	Lass uns heute Abend gehen.
__label__de	Ich möchte in Zukunft Arzt werden.
__label__de	Ich habe noch nicht gewonnen.
__label__de	Na, habt ihr mich vermisst?
__label__de	Na, haben Sie mich vermisst?
__label__de	Warum sind die Nationen so wütend aufeinander, und warum schmieden die Völker einen vergeblichen Plan?
__label__de	Er isst Schokolade.
__label__de	Die meisten Menschen hier sind recht freundlich.
__label__de	Du solltest besser frühstücken.
__label__de	Das sind wir schon durchgegangen.
__label__de	Komm schon, öffne es.
__label__de	Komm schon, mach auf.
__label__de	Ich wurde in Boston festgenommen.
__label__de	Wir kaufen und Sie bezahlen.
__label__de	Wir kaufen und ihr bezahlt.
__label__de	Erinnerst du dich wenigstens an sie?
__label__de	Geht sie denn nicht?
__label__de	Ihre Tochter spielt mit dem Baby.
__label__de	Wirst du mir sagen, was du willst?
__label__de	Ich wollte mich bei dir für vorhin bedanken.
__label__de	Ich wollte mich bei Ihnen für vorhin bedanken.
__label__de	Tut mir leid, ich tanze nicht.
__label__de	Ich habe einige besondere Gäste eingeladen.
__label__de	Nie Lebensmittel im Zelt aufbewahren!
__label__de	Tut mir leid, Jungs, aber ich habe schon was vor.
__label__de	Wir sollten dieses Wochenende mal was unternehmen.
__label__de	Tom hat die Hieroglyphen übersetzt.
__label__de	Warum haben Sie das überhaupt getan?
__label__de	Warum hast du das überhaupt getan?
__label__de	Er denkt scharf nach.
__label__de	Ich finde, das muss gefeiert werden.
__label__de	Tom und Maria brachen in den zugangsbeschränkten Bibliotheksbereich ein.
__label__de	Dank Toms besonderem Orangensaft geht es mir prächtig.
__label__de	Zeigen Sie uns Ihre natürliche Begabung.
__label__de	Als Jugendliche neigen Jungen eher als Mädchen dazu, sich nicht richtig auf die Schule zu konzentrieren und schwache Leistungen zu erbringen.
__label__de	Snoop Dogg ist der berühmteste Kiffer der Welt.
__label__de	Selbst Amateure wie wir können erkennen, dass das schlecht ist.
__label__de	Aber weißt du, er hatte einen Hintergedanken.
__label__de	Aber wissen Sie, er hatte einen Hintergedanken.

__label__de	Die Minister verdienen in Ungarn umgerechnet 10.000 Euro pro Monat und die Lehrer 450.
__label__de	Du hasst Biden, weil er Sozialist ist. Ich hasse Biden, weil er kein Sozialist ist. Wir sind nicht dasselbe.
__label__de	Ich würde nicht hineingehen.
__label__de	Ich gehe eher nicht hinein.
__label__de	Er ist schon fast 30 und hat bisher keine ernste Beziehung gehabt.
__label__de	Bisons furzten früher die Stratosphäre voll – die wurden ausgerottet. Jetzt furzen die Rinder. Und danach werden Antilopen, Gnus und Zebras furzen.
__label__de	Klimatisierte Traktoren und Mähdrescher sind umweltfreundlich – Kühe sind es nicht.
__label__de	„Ihr furzt zu viel – es tut mir leid“, sagte Joulupukki zu Rudolf.
__label__de	Gib ihr nicht zu viel Geld!
__label__de	Mein zweitältester Bruder ist schon über 50.
__label__de	Würdest du mich auch dann wollen, wenn du wüsstest, dass ich früher ein Mann war?
__label__de	Wir bedauern, von Ihrem Angebot keinen Gebrauch machen zu können.
__label__de	Tom stört oft den Unterricht.
__label__de	Die 53jährige Dagmar Turner spielt, schon seit sie zehn war, leidenschaftlich gerne Geige und ist zur Zeit Mitglied des Sinfonieorchesters der Insel Wight.
__label__de	Er läuft ohne Schuhe.
__label__de	Die Pizza hat Käse.
__label__de	Die Frauen entwerfen Kleidung.
__label__de	Die, die nicht arbeiten, sind gefährlich für die Menschheit; das sind entweder Diebe oder Philosopher oder Politiker oder Spekulanten.
__label__de	Diese Reise ist gefahrlos.
__label__de	Tom hat meine Frage bejaht.
__label__de	Vor Gebrauch aufzuschütteln!
__label__de	Dieses Paket hat jemand gebracht, dessen Muttersprache nicht Deutsch war.
__label__de	Ist diese Farbe braun?
__label__de	Es wird mehr Geld benötigt.
__label__de	Tom wurde von den Professoren eine Stunde lang mit Fragen geröstet.
__label__de	Sie hat schon ihre Augen geöffnet.
__label__de	Er ist schon zu sich gekommen, er hat aber noch nicht gesprochen.
__label__de	52 Seeleute waren an Bord der Minerve, als sie im Januar 1968 verschwand.
__label__de	Okahana and Koc sind sich einig, dass die Berufsaussichten für Leute mit Doktorgrad in der Vergangenheit viel klarer waren.
__label__de	Tom wurde eingeschüchtert und passte seine öffentlichen Äußerungen der Staatsmeinung an.
__label__de	Im Umgang mit Superlativen ist Vorsicht geboten: sie nutzen sich leicht ab.
__label__de	Nirgends wohnen Ost- und Westdeutsche näher beieinander als in Berlin.
__label__de	Die Berliner Mauer war ein Symbol nicht nur der Teilung Berlins und der Teilung Deutschlands, sondern auch des kalten Krieges.
__label__de	Wir dürfen vor der Größe der Aufgabe, die auf uns zukommt, nicht verzagen.
__label__de	In Damaskus wartet auf Tom der Galgen.

__label__de	Seit heute steht in Leipzig ein richtiger, großer Übertragungswagen des Westdeutschen Rundfunks, und er wird ab sofort und die ganze nächste Woche in Betrieb sein.
__label__de	Jeder, der kommen will, kann kommen. Niemand weiß, wie viele wollen. Wenn es sehr viele sein werden, schafft das die Bundesrepublik?
__label__de	Hoffentlich überheben wir uns nicht.
__label__de	„Sind Marias Nägel echt?“ – „Ach was! Die sind nur aufgeklebt.“
__label__de	Ich bin nur dann dein Freund, wenn du von mir etwas willst.
__label__de	Steff hat mir 15 Euro für Spritkosten gegeben.
__label__de	Ich bastle schon eine Weile an dieser Übersetzung herum, aber ich kann irgendwie nichts Passendes finden.
__label__de	Ich kann nichts finden, was mir gefällt.
__label__de	Man braucht Geld, um nie daran zu denken.
__label__de	Wir sind miteinander alt geworden.
__label__de	Vergessen Sie nicht, Ihrer Wertschätzung Ausdruck zu verleihen.
__label__de	Denkt daran, eure Wertschätzung auszusprechen.
__label__de	Denken Sie daran, Ihre Wertschätzung auszusprechen.
__label__de	Vergiss nicht, deine Wertschätzung auszudrücken.
__label__de	Mir gefällt es nicht, dass du dich mit meiner Tochter triffst.
__label__de	Tom ist älter als dein Vater.
__label__de	Tom ist älter als Ihr Vater.
__label__de	Wenn ich deine Hilfe wollte, hätte ich dich darum gebeten.
__label__de	„Wann kommst du morgen unters Messer?“ – „Die Operation ist für 14 Uhr angesetzt.“
__label__de	Tom kommt jetzt unters Messer. Bei ihm wurde ein Tumor entdeckt, der wegmuss.
__label__de	Sakura ist eine kluge Studentin.
__label__de	Ein Affe tippte wahllos auf einer Schreibmaschine herum, und eine Gruppe Wissenschaftler versuchte daraufhin, dem, was dabei herausgekommen war, irgendeinen Sinn zu geben. Es war eine hochinteressante Diskussion.
__label__de	’s war Thomas, der den Drachen erschlug.
__label__de	Ich bin traurig ohne dich.
__label__de	Ich fühle mich so allein.
__label__de	Die Ursachen dafür können sehr vielseitig sein.
__label__de	Tatoeba gibt dir hier ein paar Tipps!
__label__de	Sprich mit deinen Eltern!
__label__de	Ich glaube, du hast zumindest teilweise Recht.
__label__de	Tom drückte jedem der beiden Handwerker eine Flasche Bier in die Hand und sagte, sie sollten erst mal Pause machen.
__label__de	Maria verbrannten die Brote im Ofen, während sie sich mit dem Nachbarn unterhielt.
__label__de	Nie hast du Zeit, wenn ich dir aus meinem Leben erzählen will!
__label__de	Obwohl ich es mir jetzt leisten könnte, gebe ich meinen Beruf nicht auf.
__label__de	„Was gibt es denn zum Nachtisch?“ – „Rote Grütze.“ – „Selbstgemacht?“ – „Aus dem Supermarkt.“
__label__de	Ihr denkt immer nur an euch. Wie es mir geht, ist euch völlig gleichgültig.
__label__de	„Mama hat mich vorhin gefragt, ob ich sie hübsch finde.“ – „Und was hast du gesagt?“
__label__de	Da Mikroplastik nicht verdaut werden kann, sammelt es sich in den Fischen, die es fressen, an.
__label__de	Ich höre keltische Musik.
__label__de	Mit der Schleuder weiß er trefflich umzugehen.
__label__de	Für viele Museen ist es ein sehr trauriger Moment.
__label__de	Bitte, Tom! Du darfst nicht mit mir Schluss machen!
__label__de	Was steht heute auf der Speisekarte?
__label__de	Bist du noch hier, wenn ich wiederkomme?
__label__de	Seid ihr noch hier, wenn ich wiederkomme?
__label__de	Sind Sie noch hier, wenn ich wiederkomme?
__label__de	Tom bot einem Obdachlosen etwas zu essen an.
__label__de	Tom bot einer Obdachlosen etwas zu essen an.
__label__de	Wir müssen das ohne Tom machen.
__label__de	Es kam von dort.
__label__de	Andreas ist wie ein Mädchen gehüpft.
__label__de	Viele der Leute in dem Forum sind Klugscheißer und Besserwisser.

__label__de	Wir erleben gerade, wie unser friedliches Leben dem Ende gefährlich nahekommt.
__label__de	Wir erleben gerade, wie die Menschheit am Abgrund entlangbalanciert.
__label__de	Nun steht uns also wieder ein Weltkrieg bevor. Ich glaube, das Coronavirus hat die ganze Welt wahnsinnig gemacht.
__label__de	Wenn die Ampel auf Rot steht, muss man halten.
__label__de	Im Herbst bräunen sich die Blätter der Bäume.
__label__de	Was ist damit gemeint?
__label__de	Bitte geben Sie mir einen Hinweis.
__label__de	Seelenfrieden erlangt man nicht dadurch, dass man Problemen aus dem Weg geht, sondern dadurch, dass man sie löst.
__label__de	Die Richtung unseres Geistes ist wichtiger als sein Fortschritt.
__label__de	Tom durchschaut meine Absichten.
__label__de	Tom hat ihn längst durchschaut.
__label__de	Die Wissenschaft ist die systematische Klassifizierung der Erfahrung.
__label__de	Die meisten Stiftungen reicher Leute sind der Ausdruck tätiger Reue.
__label__de	Man schimpft nur solange auf die Arbeit, bis man keine mehr hat.
__label__de	Im Herbst werden die Blätter braun.
__label__de	Im Herbst verfärben sich die Blätter braun.
__label__de	Danke, dass du mich immer zum Lachen bringst!
__label__de	Einmal produzierten die Deutschen mit ihren Windrädern zuviel Strom und wussten nicht, wohin damit; also schenkten sie den grünen Strom den Österreichern, damit die ihn abnähmen. Die nutzten ihn nun, um damit ihre Speicherkraftwerke zu laden, und als dann eine Windflaute war und den Deutschen Strom fehlte, boten die Österreicher den gespeicherten Strom an, und die Deutschen kauften ihn.
__label__de	Einmal beschlossen die Deutschen, alle Kraftwerke gleichzeitig auszuschalten – und wunderten sich, warum kein Strom da war.
__label__de	Als ein Schweizer gefragt wurde, was er nicht an Deutschland verstehe, antwortete er, dass er nicht verstehe, warum die Löhne nicht mit der Wirtschaft wüchsen und warum die Deutschen Deutschland zu einem reichen Billiglohnland machten.
__label__de	Einmal beschlossen die Deutschen, alle ihre Atomkraftwerke abzureißen, weil es in Japan gebebt hatte. Als der Strom dann aber nicht reichte, kauften sie den Strom, den die Franzosen fröhlich mit ihren Atomkraftwerken produzierten.
__label__de	Darf ich erklären?
__label__de	Das Mädchen hat schwarzes Haar und blaue Augen.
__label__de	Du bist nicht hässlich.
__label__de	Sie sind nicht hässlich.
__label__de	Ihr seid nicht hässlich.
__label__de	Ich würde Deinen Artikel gerne ins Französische übersetzen.
__label__de	Dürfte ich Deinen Artikel ins Französische übersetzen?
__label__de	Die Katze ist aus dem Sack gelassen!
__label__de	Das Geheimnis ist gelüftet!
__label__de	Lebst Du noch in Deinem Elternhaus?
__label__de	Ein Taxi fuhr auf mich zu.
__label__de	Ich glaube, der Präsident wird gegen die Gesetzesvorlage Einspruch erheben.
__label__de	Hat man den Attentäter mittlerweile geschnappt?
__label__de	Entschuldigung, Ich wollte Dich nicht unterbrechen.
__label__de	Wir haben nur wenig Reis übrig.
__label__de	Sei vorsichtig, damit Du Dich nicht verletzt.
__label__de	Ich wünschte, alle Menschen würden von der Welt verschwinden.
__label__de	Wann startet mein Flieger?
__label__de	Diese Overalls sind sehr bequem
__label__de	Wer passt auf die Sachen auf?
__label__de	Lass uns nie mehr darüber sprechen.
__label__de	Denkst du, er hat dich gern?
__label__de	Die Tragödie der Liebe ist Gleichgültigkeit.
__label__de	Er ist auf unserer Seite.
__label__de	Ihr Freund sagte ihrer Familie nicht zu.
__label__de	Schokolade ist Gift für Hunde; die können dadurch eingehen!
__label__de	Tom ist nicht so beweglich wie Maria.
__label__de	Tom ist nicht so flexibel wie Maria.
__label__de	Tom wusste nicht, wen er zu seiner Geburtstagsfeier einladen sollte.
__label__de	Ich glaube nicht, dass ihn das gekümmert hat.
__label__de	Ich glaube, es war ihm egal.
__label__de	Die Schubkraft gibt an, wieviel eine Rakete schieben kann.
__label__de	Tom fing an, wie wild zu zittern.
__label__de	Toms Mutter heiratete sehr bald nach seines Vaters Tode erneut.
__label__de	Nachdem Toms Vater gestorben war, heiratete seine Mutter sehr bald erneut.
__label__de	Nachdem sein Vater gestorben war, da dauerte es nicht lang, und seine Mutter heiratete erneut, ihren heimlichen Geliebten nämlich, der 30 Jahre jünger war als sie.
__label__de	Toms Mutter heiratete sofort neu, als Toms Vater starb.
__label__de	Ich werde nie so wie Maria sein. Warum akzeptierst du das nicht einfach?
__label__de	Ich hatte gehofft, dass mehr aus unserer Freundschaft würde.
__label__de	Ich hatte gehofft, dass sich aus unserer Freundschaft etwas mehr entwickeln würde.
__label__de	Ich möchte, dass du meine Freundin wirst.
__label__de	„Ich möchte dich als Freundin haben.“ – „Das kannst du dir aus dem Kopf schlagen, Tom! Ich will nichts von dir!“
__label__de	Tom glaubt, seine Arbeit sei bedeutungslos.
__label__de	Tiere haben für diesen Film leiden müssen.
__label__de	Die Meerjungfrauen versuchten, die Seefahrer mit ihrem Liebreiz einzuspinnen, aber in Wirklichkeit waren diese Wesen Ungeheuer, welche die Männer fressen wollten. Am Strand ihres Landes lagen überall die Knochen vorheriger Opfer verstreut.
__label__de	Eine der Meerjungfrauen verliebte sich wirklich in einen der Seefahrer, weil der sich nicht nur über sie hermachen wollte, sondern sich speziell für sie interessierte und auch besonders klug war, und sie wollte ihn daher vor dem Schicksal bewahren, von ihren Schwestern gefressen zu werden.
__label__de	Wenn man damals zu jemandem gesagt hat: „Hol mir das goldene Vlies!“, dann hieß das soviel wie „Verschwinde! Geh hin, wo der Pfeffer wächst!“, aber Jason, der ein bisschen naiv war, antwortete: „Das goldene Vlies? Ja, das hol’ ich dir“, und dann machte er sich schon auf den Weg.
__label__de	Aus dem hässlichen Entlein ward ein wunderschöner Schwan.
__label__de	Meine Mutter hat, gleich nachdem mein Vater gestorben war, wieder geheiratet, und zwar einen Mann, der zehn Jahre jünger war als ich.
__label__de	Kurz nachdem meine Mutter gestorben war, heiratete mein Vater Agnes, die früher an der Schule zwei Klassen unter mir gewesen war, und die meldet sich jetzt am Telefon mit meinem Nachnamen!
__label__de	Tom und Maria hoffen, bis morgen damit fertig zu werden.
__label__de	Der Scholz muss sich langsam mal fragen, als was er in die Geschichte eingehen will.
__label__de	In Deutschland wird den Menschen nahegelegt, nicht zu duschen.
__label__de	Parteipolitik braucht kein Mensch. Jetzt ist Pragmatismus angesagt.
__label__de	Die Leute im Land haben – völlig zu Recht – Existenzängste.
__label__de	Wenn du dich mit dir selbst anfreundest, bist du niemals allein.
__label__de	Man entdeckt eine neue Welt, wenn man den Mut hat, die alte zu verlassen.
__label__de	Der wahre gute Mensch ist bescheiden, zurückhaltend, unauffällig und glänzt durch stille Taten.
__label__de	Du bist der Meister deines Seins.
__label__de	Du bist das Licht. Jetzt ist Erkenntnis möglich!
__label__de	Tom verdient zehnmal mehr als ich.
__label__de	Je tiefer du blickst, umso mehr wirst du finden!
__label__de	Werde jetzt zu dem Diamanten, der du bist, in dem sich das Licht des Kosmos in den wnderbaren Farben eines Prismas bricht und strahlt.
__label__de	Es gibt keinen Anlass zur Eile oder dazu, die Dinge voranzutreiben. Alles geschieht zu seiner Zeit.
__label__de	Das Wunderbarste von all dem, was im Menschen ist, ist sein Herz, denn es ordnet sein ganzes Wesen.
__label__de	„Energisch“ wird im Deutschen nicht mit Körperkräften verbunden, sondern mit Taten und Willen.
__label__de	Der Glaube macht alle Dinge möglich. Die Hoffnung macht alle Dinge. Liebe macht alles schön.
__label__de	Er entschlief.
__label__de	Er schlief ein und erwachte nimmermehr.
__label__de	Sich ganz aus dem Netz zurückzuziehen ist für viele unrealistisch.
__label__de	Auf der Treppe stand, sie zu empfangen, eine alte Frau, adrett in schwarze Seide gekleidet, dazu eine weiße Haube und Schürze.
__label__de	Nicht nur die Luft zum Atmen, sondern auch reines Wasser haben wir mit den Wäldern zu verdanken.
__label__de	Da sich die meiste Luft in der unmittelbaren Nähe der Erdoberfläche befindet, so ist die Troposphäre die Schicht mit der größten Dichte in der Atmosphäre.
__label__de	Tom war zu verärgert, um etwas zu sagen.
__label__de	Es ist mir eine große Freude, euch meinen Freund Tom vorzustellen.
__label__de	Auf einer Feier habe ich sie mal geküsst.
__label__de	Morgen ist Niedersachsenwahl. Gehst du hin?
__label__de	„Und wen wählst du?“ – „Schon mal was von Wahlgeheimnis gehört?“
__label__de	„Morgen ist Wahl. Da müssen wir unbedingt hin!“ – „Aber du wählst doch sonst nicht.“
__label__de	Mit der Hoffnungslosigkeit beginnt der wahre Optimismus.
__label__de	„Will Oma Else nicht zur Wahl?“ – „Nein, sie meinte, für sie ändere sich doch nichts, egal, wen sie wähle; daher wähle sie jetzt überhaupt nicht mehr.“
__label__de	Gib mir Deinen Mantel.
__label__de	Menschen in dieser Kultur kleiden sich farbenfroh.
__label__de	Schlechte Gewohnheiten abzulegen ist schwierig.
__label__de	Ich bot Tom meine Hilfe an, aber er meinte, er bräuchte keine.
__label__de	Hast du Tom sein Buch zurückgegeben?
__label__de	Sami veränderte sein Äußeres und nahm den Namen Farid Bakir an.
__label__de	Glaubst Du wirklich, dass Tom in Australien ist?
__label__de	Mary sagte, dass sie sehr eifersüchtig war.
__label__de	Lange her, dass ich das getan habe.
__label__de	Wie lange arbeitest Du schon hier?
__label__de	Tom weiß gar nichts über Mary, außer ihren Namen.
__label__de	Sami hatte dort keine Familie.
__label__de	Ich stand auf vor dem Sonnenuntergang.
__label__de	Sami wusste wie die Dinge dort funktionierten.
__label__de	Er blieb nur aus Schuldgefühlen bei ihr.
__label__de	Tom sagte mir, dass er dieses Problem zuvor nie hatte.
__label__de	Ich bin zu müde um zu fahren.
__label__de	Tom kommt nicht oft hier vorbei.
__label__de	Sie sagten, dass sie glauben, dass sie es nicht tun würden.
__label__de	Ich verlange zwei Hundert Euro für dieses Stillleben.
__label__de	Ich bin mir sicher jemand wird Tom und Mary dabei helfen.
__label__de	Tom wusste, dass Mary wütend auf ihn sein würde.
__label__de	Ich hätte es besser wissen müssen, als das zu tun.
__label__de	Mama, warum weint die Tante da?
__label__de	Ein Fond wurde für den Schutz der Meerestiere eingerichtet.
__label__de	Gute Antwort!
__label__de	Ich möchte das auch nicht machen.
__label__de	Eine Kuh sagt "muh" und ein Schwein sagt "oink".
__label__de	Mehrere Zeugen haben gegen sie ausgesagt, aber sie wurde dennoch freigesprochen.
__label__de	Bist Du mit Tom mal zum Schlittschuhelaufen gewesen?
__label__de	Ich habe ein Auto gefunden, dass für mein Lebensalter passend ist.
__label__de	Aus dem Stall war das Grunzen der Schweine zu hören.
__label__de	Schreib Dir das hinter die Löffel.
__label__de	Ich habe keine Lust, dass mit Tom zu machen.
__label__de	Sami selbst stört das nicht.
__label__de	Sie lehnte sich auf ihre Skistöcke
__label__de	Tom kam zu Fuß an.
__label__de	Ich hab' da Angst vor. (infor)
__label__de	Willst Du Glühwein?
__label__de	Tom und ich sind verheiratet.
__label__de	Ich bin gerade beim Einkaufen.
__label__de	Sie schaute vorsichtig nach dem Vogel im Nest.
__label__de	Du glaubst wohl alles, was sie dir vor der Wahl noch so verzapfen?
__label__de	„Wie lange willst du Tom denn noch bei dir einquartieren?“ – „Bis er etwas anderes gefunden hat.“ – „Eine Dauerlösung ist das auf jeden Fall nicht!“
__label__de	Den Deutschen wird geraten, sie sollten jetzt mehr kalte Speisen zu sich nehmen, um Energie zu sparen, sofern sie sich noch Lebensmittel leisten könnten.
__label__de	Dieser Saal ist zu groß.
__label__de	Du kannst Dir selbst einen Hund in dem Laden kaufen.
__label__de	Warte auf mich neben dem Baum da.
__label__de	Mach der Frau Müller mal einen Kaffee, aber einen starken!
__label__de	Unser neues Ato ist nicht sehr groß.
__label__de	Sehr wahrscheinlich kommt der Bus zu spät. Warum nehmen wir nicht ein Taxi?
__label__de	Hast Du jemals etwas richtig gemacht?
__label__de	Ich war 3 Tage lang dort.
__label__de	„Ist Prof. Hansen noch im Haus? Ich hätte eigentlich schon gestern kommen sollen.“ – „Nein, das tut mir leid. Der ist heute Morgen mit dem Zug nach Leningrad abgereist.“
__label__de	Tom stand mit einem Kameratrupp auf der Invalidenstraße und wartete auf die ersten nach Westberlin kommenden DDR-Bürger.
__label__de	Mädchen denken in Gefühlsdingen immer etwas weiter als Jungen.
__label__de	Tom ist immer bereit, sich für alles Gute und gegen alles Schlechte auszusprechen.
__label__de	Lieber Papa, mach dir bitte keine Vorwürfe, wenn du diesen Brief findest. Verantwortlich bin ich ganz allein für das, was ich tun werde.
__label__de	Ich habe Toms Vertrauen verloren und Marias nie gehabt.
__label__de	Maria wollte sich mit einem Tablettencocktail, den sie mit Rotwein runterspülte, das Leben nehmen, aber Tom fand sie gerade noch rechtzeitig, und sie wurde mit schweren Hirnschäden ins Krankenhaus eingeliefert.
__label__de	Ich mag das Geräusch einer auf dem Papier kratzenden Feder.
__label__de	Du, ich muss mal auf Toilette. Ich bin gleich wieder da.
__label__de	Benutzt heute eigentlich noch jemand einen Wecker, den man aufziehen muss?
__label__de	Maria wollte sich mit einem Tablettencocktail das Leben nehmen, aber ihre Tochter, die das Vorhaben aufgrund verschiedener Äußerungen ahnte, hatte die Tabletten durch ähnlich aussehende Zuckerdragees ersetzt.
__label__de	Ein Kind zu kriegen ist relativ einfach, es zu haben weitaus komplizierter.
__label__de	„Liest du mir was vor?“ – „Aber du kannst doch schon selber lesen!“
__label__de	Wenn man einmal ganz unten ist, kann einen da keiner mehr rausholen.
__label__de	Wir müssen uns gegenseitig helfen. Wir dürfen nicht das Gespür für die Not des anderen verlieren.
__label__de	Ist der Herr Müller nicht derjenige, dessen Frau sich umgebracht hat? Traurige Geschichte!
__label__de	Tom sagt immer, seinen Nachbarn gehe man am besten aus dem Weg. Dann spare man sich viele Scherereien.
__label__de	Dein Tom ist schon einer. Wie du an den geraten bist, das ist mir heute noch schleierhaft.
__label__de	Barmherzig und gnädig ist der Herr, geduldig und von großer Güte. / Er wird nicht immer hadern noch ewiglich Zorn halten. / Er handelt nicht mit uns nach unsern Sünden und vergilt uns nicht nach unsrer Missetat. / Denn so hoch der Himmel über der Erde ist, läßt er seine Gnade walten über die, so ihn fürchten. / So ferne der Morgen ist vom Abend, läßt er unsre Übertretungen von uns sein. / Wie sich ein Vater über Kinder erbarmt, so erbarmt sich der Herr über die, so ihn fürchten.
__label__de	Ein Mensch ist in seinem Leben wie Gras, er blüht wie eine Blume auf dem Feld; / wenn der Wind darüber geht, so ist sie nimmer da, und ihre Stätte kennt sie nicht mehr.
__label__de	Während des Berufsverkehrs ist man mit dem Fahrrad schneller als mit dem Auto.
__label__de	Ich bin froh, dass ich mich in dir nicht getäuscht habe.
__label__de	Ich bin froh, dass ich mich in euch nicht getäuscht habe.
__label__de	Ich bin froh, dass ich mich in Ihnen nicht getäuscht habe.
__label__de	Maria ist diese typische Mischung aus kleinem Mädchen und Femme fatale.
__label__de	Als ich noch ein kleines Mädchen war, glaubte ich, dass die Leute, von denen ich träumte, sich mit mir gemeinsam an den Traum erinnern könnten.
__label__de	Wie alt ist der Elefant?
__label__de	Der Februar hat keine dreißig Tage.
__label__de	Selber Schuld.
__label__de	Das werde ich dir erklären.
__label__de	Das werde ich euch erklären.
__label__de	Sie ist gesprächig; ihr Gatte aber ist das genaue Gegenteil und spicht nie.
__label__de	Das werde ich Ihnen erklären.
__label__de	Tom hat gekocht.
__label__de	Ich will sie nicht enttäuschen.
__label__de	Kommt ausser Ihrem Kumpel noch jemand?
__label__de	Tom glaubt, er könne Erfolg haben, wo andere versagten.
__label__de	„Wenn das ein französischer Film ist, warum sind die Lieder dann alle auf Englisch?“ – „Das liegt an der deutschen Synchronfassung, für die man die französischen Lieder alle durch englische ersetzt hat.“
__label__de	Warum hast du so lange damit gewartet, mich zu küssen?
__label__de	Sie hatte eine sanfte und angenehme Stimme.
__label__de	Tom wird einmal ein großes Vermögen erben.
__label__de	Weihnachten findet dieses Jahr im Weißen Haus unter dem Thema „Schönes Amerika“ statt.
__label__de	Den Geimpften sind die Risiken bekannt gewesen. Wir lehnen daher jegliche Verantwortung für Impfnebenwirkungen ab.
__label__de	Der Schauspieler spielt sich selber in der Serie.
__label__de	Ich bin von mir selber enttäuscht; ich bin ein feiger Hund.
__label__de	Er trägt 4XL T-Shirts.
__label__de	Mein ältester Bruder ist jünger als ich.
__label__de	Der T-Rex zog sich ein T-Shirt an, obgleich sein großer Kopf und seine kurzen Arme es ihm schwermachten.
__label__de	Ich sage dir, warum ich es getan habe.
__label__de	Weißt du, wer ihr Mann ist?
__label__de	Demokratie heißt, dass man alle paar Jahre von seinem Wahlrecht Gebrauch machen kann. Danach kann man nur zusehen, was die alten oder neuen Clowns machen, und beten, dass sie nicht das Zelt zum Einsturz bringen.
__label__de	Wir übernehmen keine Verantwortung.
__label__de	Ich habe gehört, wie du sangst.
__label__de	Du hast bestimmt Hunger.
__label__de	Leuchte mal hierhin!
__label__de	Der Innenminister ist trotz eines vor dreißig Jahren begangenen Verbrechens mit großem Vermögensschaden immer noch auf freiem Fuß.
__label__de	Es ist draußen kalt. Zieh dich warm an!
__label__de	„Ich bin blitzschnell!“ – „Schnell bin ich auch.“
__label__de	Das Phänomen der leeren Supermarktregale ist in Deutschland erst seit kurzer Zeit zu beobachten. Sollte uns das Sorgen machen?
__label__de	Das Phänomen der leeren Supermarktregale begann in Deutschland mit den Hamsterkäufen von Toilettenpapier, Mehl, Nudeln, Hefe usw. während des Coronawahnsinns und tritt seitdem regelmäßig auf.
__label__de	Ich glaube, seit der Coronakrise ist absolut nichts und niemand mehr normal.
__label__de	Die Welt bewegt sich auf irgendeine Form der Apokalypse zu.
__label__de	Die Feinde des Systems erleiden einen Verkehrsunfall oder sterben an einem Herzinfarkt oder fallen aus dem Fenster oder hängen sich auf.
__label__de	Ursula legt der alten Dame Europa ein Seil um den Hals.
__label__de	China ist das Land der Superlative.
__label__de	Tom ist schon teilweise ergraut.
__label__de	Wann hat Tom mit dem Rauchen angefangen?
__label__de	„Hast du eine Lampe dabei?“ – „Nein, aber ich kann mit meinem Handy leuchten.“
__label__de	Der jüngste meiner älteren Brüder ist schon über Fünfzig.
__label__de	Wo bist du denn so lange gewesen? Ich wäre vor Sehnsucht nach dir fast gestorben!
__label__de	Dass die Männer solche Verbrecher sein können!
__label__de	Dass ein einzelner Mensch soviel Unheil anrichten kann!
__label__de	„Ich habe gehört, wie du gesungen hast.“ – „Du hast gelauscht?“
__label__de	Aber schau doch!
__label__de	Bis jetzt ist alles gut gegangen.
__label__de	Wir können dich nicht zum Bleiben zwingen.
__label__de	So weit läuft alles gut.
__label__de	Schneide bitte diese Schnur durch.
__label__de	Ich bin ein gefragter Mann.
__label__de	Es ist Zeitverschwendung, dieses Problem noch länger zu lösen zu versuchen.
__label__de	In unserer Sprache verwenden wir die doppelte Verneinung.
__label__de	Ich erwäge einen Jobwechsel.
__label__de	Tom sagte, dass er dabei keinen Spaß hatte.
__label__de	Ist das Bims?
__label__de	Angst ist ein Mangel an Selbstvertrauen.
__label__de	Träume werden dir Einblick in bunte Welten bieten, die es im Universum zu entdecken gilt.
__label__de	Verbinde dich mit deinem inneren Licht und du wirst deine Harmonie finden.
__label__de	Es ist eine ganz bekannte Sache, dass die Viertelstündchen größer sind, als die Viertelstunden.
__label__de	Wo damals die Grenzen der Wissenschaft waren, da ist jetzt die Mitte.
__label__de	Der gesunde Gelehrte ist der Mann bei dem Nachdenken keine Krankheit ist.
__label__de	Es ist nicht gesagt, dass es besser wird, wenn es anders wird. Wenn es aber besser werden soll, muss es anders werden.
__label__de	Ich hab’ Bock, was anzupacken und die Welt zu verändern, aber irgendwer muss auch mitmachen; sonst können wir’s lassen.
__label__de	Was will sie eigentlich wissen?
__label__de	Vom Wahrsagen lässt sichs wohl leben in der Welt, nicht aber vom Wahrheit sagen.
__label__de	Wann muss man ein Adverb benutzen?
__label__de	Jeder sollte wissen, was ein Adverb und was ein Adjektiv ist.
__label__de	Ich würde mich wirklich sehr freuen.
__label__de	Ich würde mich sehr freuen, wenn du mich noch lange begleitest.
__label__de	Begleitest du mich auf allen Wegen?
__label__de	Musst dich nur vom Neide reinigen, dann verzehnfachst du dein Glück.
__label__de	Wir haben einen neuen Pfarrer in unserer Kirchengemeinde.
__label__de	Die Männerliebe galt damals als die reine Liebe, während die Liebe zwischen Mann und Frau auch auf das Geschlechtliche, die Fortpflanzung, gerichtet war.
__label__de	Tom mied das eheliche Bett. Er war die ganze Zeit bei Johannes, seinem Geliebten.
__label__de	Maria hatte den Körper einer Löwin und Flügel.
__label__de	Da Tom und Maria es nun doch nicht riskieren wollten, dass der Orakelspruch wahr würde, beschlossen sie, den Knaben irgendwo aussetzen zu lassen, und sie übergaben ihn einem Diener, dass der ihn in den Wald brächte, wo ihn die wilden Tiere fressen sollten.
__label__de	Als Maria die Lösung dieses Rätsels präsentiert bekam, da war sie so verzweifelt, dass sie sich das Leben nahm.
__label__de	Der Kommissar ließ sich die Akte aus dem Archiv holen.
__label__de	Das Buch war nicht in der Bibliothek, und es war auch niemand da, den ich nach dessen Verbleib hätte fragen können.
__label__de	Tom spricht immer sehr antiquiert.
__label__de	Ich habe dein Buch gelesen.
__label__de	Tom hat im Bundestag ein Feuerwerk vom Stapel gelassen. Immer, wenn es mir schlecht geht, höre ich mir diese Rede an.
__label__de	Nach dieser Rede im Bundestag ist Tom zu einem meiner persönlichen Helden aufgestiegen.
__label__de	Tom hat eine beeindruckende Rede gehalten. Selbst seine Gegner applaudierten ihm.
__label__de	Ich werde hierbleiben und dir Gesellschaft leisten.
__label__de	Darüber spricht nie jemand.
__label__de	Niemand spricht je darüber.
__label__de	Es hat über hundertausend Jahre gedauert, bis der anatomisch moderne Mensch auch im Verhalten Modernität entwickelt hat.
__label__de	Evolutionäre Psychologie ist im Wesentlichen eine Pseudowissenschaft, da sie weder gemessen noch überprüft werden kann und nicht auf experimentellen Ergebnissen beruht.
__label__de	Der Strom ist in Deutschland schweineteuer.
__label__de	Ich hätte gerne zwei Hotdogs mit Senf und Ketchup.
__label__de	Hast du es fertiggemacht?
__label__de	Der Strom ist in Deutschland mehr als 9mal so teuer wie in Algerien, 6mal so teuer wie in Russland, mehr als 3½mal so teuer wie in Norwegen, 3mal so teuer wie in Ungarn, knapp 2½mal so teuer wie in den USA und mehr als 1½mal so teuer wie in Frankreich.
__label__de	Deutschland hat den höchsten Strompreis auf der ganzen Welt.
__label__de	In Österreich und in der Schweiz kostet der Strom nur etwa zwei drittelmal so viel wie in Deutschland.
__label__de	Nachdem Tom aus Boston zurückgekehrt war, flog er nach Australien.
__label__de	Früher hat man gespart; heute zahlt man.
__label__de	„Woher kommt eigentlich dieses ganze Geld, das man ausgibt?“ – „Man macht neue Schulden, aber das wird mit Euphemismen verschleiert.“
__label__de	Lebensmittel aus dem Supermarkt werden zu einem Luxusgut. Man sollte wieder mit Selbstversorgung anfangen.
__label__de	Wenn das Geld vorne und hinten nicht mehr reicht, muss man zum Selbstversorger werden.
__label__de	Du hast ein Anrecht auf eine Meinung, aber nicht darauf, dass man dir auch zuhört.
__label__de	Lass uns essen, Oma.
__label__de	Lass uns Oma essen.
__label__de	Düstere Zeiten brechen an.
__label__de	Es ist fast unmöglich, die Fackel der Wahrheit durch ein Gedränge zu tragen, ohne jemandem den Bart zu sengen.
__label__de	Es erfordert außerordentlich viel Talent, einem vernünftigen Manne etwas Neues und Wichtiges so leicht vorzutragen, dass er sich freut, es jetzt zu wissen.
__label__de	Vergnügen an Veränderungen ist dem Menschen bleibend eigen.
__label__de	Mir tut allemal weh, wenn ein Mann von Talent stirbt, denn die Welt hat dergleichen nötiger als der Himmel.
__label__de	Er bewegte sich so langsam wie ein Stunden-Zeiger unter einem Haufen von Sekunden-Zeigern.
__label__de	Das Wort "Schwierigkeit" muss für einen Menschen von Geist gar nicht als existent betrachtet werden.
__label__de	Der Erfolg eines Menschen setzt sich aus seinen Fehlschlägen zusammen.
__label__de	Die Regierung hat in den letzten zwölf Jahren gar nichts gemacht, nur Schaden angerichtet.
__label__de	Die reichsten Familien behalten ihr ganzes Geld und so können die Hungrigen wenigstens nicht essen.
__label__de	Die Armen geben den noch Ärmeren, während die Superreichen auf ihren Geldsäcken sitzen.
__label__de	„Ich bringe die Unterlagen, um die mich Prof. Tanaka gebeten hat. Was soll damit geschehen?“ – „Der Professor ist auf einer Konferenz. Legen Sie sie dahin.“
__label__de	Die Reichen haben für die Ärmsten eine Spendensammlung organisiert – unter den Armen.
__label__de	Ich könnte kotzen, wenn ich über die berühmten Bankierdinastien höre.
__label__de	Es gibt keine Energiekrise, nur heuchlerische, verräterische und lügnerische Politiker.
__label__de	Ein Teil der Wähler sind nicht mehr fähig, Gedanken zu formulieren, nur zu blöken.
__label__de	Die Menschen werden anfangen zu denken, wenn es schon zu spät sein wird.
__label__de	Dieser unglaubliche Reichtum stammt aus der Ausbeutung der anderen.
__label__de	Wir schmieden Pläne für unseren Urlaub.
__label__de	Es gibt absolut keine Möglichkeit, die Insel zu verlassen.
__label__de	Die Musik war ganz laut.
__label__de	Ich glaube, dass es zu spät ist.
__label__de	Wir glauben, dass sein Nachname Jackson ist.
__label__de	Der Sonnenuntergang ist schön.
__label__de	Es ist Zeit, heimzukommen.
__label__de	Mary trägt immer zu viel Parfüm.
__label__de	Hast du mich gerade angerufen?
__label__de	Haben Sie mich gerade angerufen?
__label__de	Mein Englisch ist nicht gut genug, um mein Problem zu erklären.
__label__de	Ich muss mein Auto hier parken.
__label__de	Er überprüfte seine Taschen.
__label__de	Sie möchte eine Heldin sein.
__label__de	Dieses Baby ist sechs Monate alt.
__label__de	Wir suchen einen Rechtsanwalt.
__label__de	Wir suchen eine Rechtsanwältin.
__label__de	Wir haben uns zufällig im Supermarkt getroffen.
__label__de	Haben Sie eine Hotelliste?
__label__de	Ich bin kein Lehrer und möchte keiner werden.
__label__de	Wie doch Tom schnell spricht!
__label__de	Ein großes Licht war der Mann eben nicht, aber ein großer bequemer Leuchter. Er handelte mit anderer Leute Meinungen.
__label__de	Die Zeitungsschreiber haben sich ein hölzernes Kapellchen gebaut, das sie auch den Tempel des Ruhmes nennen, worin sie den ganzen Tag Porträte anschlagen und abnehmen und ein Gehämmer machen, dass man sein eigenes Wort nicht hört.
__label__de	Er redete oft an Orten sehr frei, wo jedermann eine heilige Miene annahm, dafür predigte er aber die Tugend wiederum an Orten, wo sie sonst kein Mensch predigte.
__label__de	Die buntesten Vögel singen am schlechtesten. Das gilt auch bei den Menschen.
__label__de	Wir waren sehr eng befreundet.
__label__de	Das ist keine passende Übersetzung.
__label__de	Im Grunde ist das Volk nur ein unvernünftiges Tier von ungeheurer Größe.
__label__de	Es gibt Menschen, die Politikern glauben.
__label__de	Wir nennen unseren Kollegen Fahrmaz einfach „Habibi“.
__label__de	Feiglinge gewinnen nicht.
__label__de	Warum bist du mir gefolgt?
__label__de	Diese Kinder sprühen vor Energie.
__label__de	Ich habe meinen Freunden diese Postkarten gezeigt.
__label__de	Möchtest du mir helfen, die Koffer zu packen?
__label__de	Wut ist ein zweischneidiges Schwert.
__label__de	Sie wollten gerade gehen, als ich ankam.
__label__de	Seit wann bist du in Brasilia?
__label__de	Maria hat in diesem Film mit über 30 eine 16jährige gespielt.
__label__de	Es ist dunkel in Toms Büro.
__label__de	Das Esszimmer befindet sich neben der Küche.
__label__de	Tom warf die Münze.
__label__de	Warum seid ihr mir gefolgt?
__label__de	Warum sind Sie mir gefolgt?
__label__de	Ohne deine Ratschläge wäre mir nichts gelungen.
__label__de	Ohne deine Ratschläge gelänge mir nichts.
__label__de	Toms Tod wurde offiziell noch nicht bestätigt.
__label__de	Wo kam sie her, und warum war sie allein?
__label__de	„Guten Morgen!“ sagte der Mann höflich.
__label__de	Wir werden ihn später sehen.
__label__de	Wir leben auf einer Insel.
__label__de	Es ist jetzt drei Uhr nachts.
__label__de	Tom begann, seine Schuhe anzuziehen.
__label__de	Er hat gestern über dich gesprochen.
__label__de	Was zeichnen wir?
__label__de	Wie lang wirst du in Houston sein?
__label__de	Für sein Alter ist Opa noch ganz schön flink.
__label__de	Sie hat ihn angeschrien.
__label__de	Schau mal! Sie kommt!
__label__de	Es ist fünf Uhr morgens.
__label__de	Natürlich möchtest du helfen.
__label__de	Ich habe eine Geschichte zu erzählen.
__label__de	Niemand verdächtigte Tom.
__label__de	Stört dich das nicht?
__label__de	Die englischen Genies gehen vor der Mode her und die deutschen hintendrein.
__label__de	Mir ist wenig am Lob der Leute gelegen. Ihr Neid wäre allenfalls das einzige, was mich noch freuen würde.
__label__de	Er war ein solcher aufmerksamer Grübler, ein Sandkorn sah er immer eher als ein Haus.
__label__de	Tom war Architekt.
__label__de	Tom kann bei uns bleiben.
__label__de	„Wie findest du diese Übersetzung, Schlumpfine?“ – „Die ist ganz schlumpfig geworden, Übersetzi!“
__label__de	Er hat sie erstochen.
__label__de	Ich kenne kein Beispiel, wo etwas, was die Leute jahrzehnelang liebten, plötzlich neu gemacht wurde und dies Anklang fand.
__label__de	Ich hatte mir schon Sorgen gemacht, dass Tom eingeschnappt sei, aber es scheint doch alles in Ordnung zu sein.
__label__de	Wenn das so weitergeht, wird man bald schon beim Betreten einer Wohnung ahnen können, ob da ein Reicher oder ein Armer wohnt, je nachdem nämlich, ob geheizt ist oder ob er Außenkleidung trägt.
__label__de	Ich habe Hunger bekommen.
__label__de	Katzen machen das, wenn sie etwas wollen.
__label__de	Ich weiß, wieviel er dir bedeutet.
__label__de	Sei lieb zu deiner Schwester!
__label__de	„Freust du dich auf heute Abend?“ – „Ich weiß es nicht. Ich habe meine Freundinnen von damals ja schon ewig nicht mehr gesehen.“
__label__de	Anna, Maria und mich nannte man damals „die drei Kichererbsen“.
__label__de	Anna, Maria und ich wurden damals „die drei Kichererbsen“ genannt.
__label__de	Würdest du dich an einer Unterschriftensammlung beteiligen? Du kennst doch so viele Leute. Die könntest du alle mobilisieren.
__label__de	Der Tee wurde mit Scones serviert.
__label__de	Es muss nicht jeder jede Erfahrung machen.
__label__de	Die Katze miaute unablässig.
__label__de	Tom hat meinen Schuss abgeblockt.
__label__de	Tom hat mich deswegen blockiert.
__label__de	Tom hat nicht gelogen, als er gesagt hat, in Boston gäbe es eine Menge zu tun.
__label__de	Wieso geht Tom nicht ans Telefon?
__label__de	Die Verantwortung lastete schwer auf mir.
__label__de	Du kannst Tom noch einholen, wenn du dich beeilst.
__label__de	Tom kennt sich mit Pferden überhaupt nicht aus.
__label__de	Wo liegen unsere größten Herausforderungen?
__label__de	Sollte man Zugeständnisse machen?
__label__de	War sie in Begleitung?
__label__de	Ich hatte keine schlechten Absichten.
__label__de	Ich bin mein eigener Herr.
__label__de	Ich habe eine postoperative Kontrolle.
__label__de	Was für eine Vergeudung!
__label__de	Stimmt, auf die Idee war ich nicht gekommen.
__label__de	Tom blieb bei seinem Vater.
__label__de	Tom ist bei seinem Vater geblieben.
__label__de	Tom sagte, er liebe mich.
__label__de	Er will eine Uhr wie deine.
__label__de	Ich denke, Tom ist nach Boston gezogen.
__label__de	Wir müssen neue Leute suchen, die in der Küche arbeiten.
__label__de	Wir haben nicht offen.
__label__de	Wir haben nicht geöffnet.
__label__de	Wir sind nicht geöffnet.
__label__de	Vielleicht brauche ich sie nicht.
__label__de	Hat jemand Hunger?
__label__de	Ich bin froh, dass ich da früh war.
__label__de	Ich bin froh, dass ich früh angekommen bin.
__label__de	Sein Onkel ist ein berühmter Arzt.
__label__de	Die Tür wird um neun Uhr verschlossen.
__label__de	Alle Schüler der Klasse sind anwesend.
__label__de	Eine Woche ist in sieben Tage unterteilt: Montag, Dienstag, Mittwoch, Donnerstag, Freitag, Samstag und Sonntag.
__label__de	Er hat mir was gestohlen.
__label__de	Du kannst mich nicht dazu zwingen.
__label__de	Wir irren allesamt, nur jeder irrt anders.
__label__de	Es gibt Leute, die können alles glauben, was sie wollen; das sind glückliche Geschöpfe.
__label__de	Das Gefühl der Gesundheit erwirbt man durch Krankheit.
__label__de	Könntest du mir heute nachmittag helfen, meine neue Kommode hochzutragen?
__label__de	Das menschliche Gesicht, der wohl interessanteste Teil der Erdoberfläche.
__label__de	Maria hatte große Mühe dabei, ihren Koffer die Treppe hochzutragen.
__label__de	Wenn die Menschen sagen, sie wollen nichts geschenkt haben, so ist es gemeiniglich ein Zeichen, daß sie etwas geschenkt haben wollen.
__label__de	Hat irgendjemand eine Idee, wie man das richtig ins Deutsche übersetzen könnte?
__label__de	Ich bin für die deutsch-französische Freundschaft.
__label__de	Kirchenglocken hört man doch auch in der ganzen Stadt, wenn zum Gottesdienst geläutet wird. Warum sollen die Muslime also nicht von den Minaretten zum Gebet rufen dürfen?
__label__de	Ich dachte nicht, dass Tom essen würde, was ich für ihn gemacht hatte.
__label__de	Hallo Welt!
__label__de	Wir sind früher gekommen.
__label__de	Hör auf, mich anzublubbern!
__label__de	Die Liebe ist eine Krankheit, die von der Zeit geheilt wird.
__label__de	Als privat Versicherter hat Tom das Recht auf Chefarztbehandlung.
__label__de	„Du hast gesagt, du habest Tom verziehen.“ – „Das habe ich auch, aber das ist nicht das Problem.“
__label__de	Ich habe Angst, dass wir’s nicht schaffen.
__label__de	Maria bangt um ihr Leben. Tom ist aus dem Gefängnis entlassen worden.
__label__de	Man hat Tom aus dem Krankenhaus zum Sterben nach Hause zurückgeschickt.
__label__de	Letzte Nacht um drei ist sein Herz einfach stehengeblieben; dabei ging es ihm schon viel besser.
__label__de	Obwohl mich Tom immer wieder betrog, liebte ich ihn.
__label__de	Warum zweifelst du daran?
__label__de	Warum zweifelt ihr daran?
__label__de	Warum zweifeln Sie daran?
__label__de	„Denk mal an all die Schweine und Rinder, die du im Laufe deiner Lebens verzehrt hast – friedliche, sanfte Tiere mit Seele.“ – „Ich denke an ein saftiges Kotelett; ich hab’ nämlich Hunger.“
__label__de	„Hast du eine Verlängerungsschnur?“ – „Ja, in der Abstellkammer, aber die brauche ich zum Staubsaugen.“
__label__de	Weißt du eigentlich, wie viele Schweine jedes Jahr für die Bundesbürger abgeschlachtet werden?
__label__de	Was magst du an deiner Familie am meisten?
__label__de	Nimm dir einen Moment Zeit und denke darüber nach!
__label__de	Denke einmal einen Augenblick darüber nach!
__label__de	Mich stoßen Leute ab, die nicht nachdenken, zu faul zum Denken sind.
__label__de	Denken ist immer konstruktiv, auch wenn das Ergebnis Zerstörung ist.
__label__de	In keinem Alter weiß man alles. In Ihrem überschlagen sich manchmal die Erkenntnisse.
__label__de	Trauer ist kein Wartesaal.
__label__de	Sie sind jung und intelligent, Sie sind gesund und leben in sicheren Verhältnissen, und Sie sind außerdem noch sehr hübsch.
__label__de	Wenn mich jemand nur wegen meines Äußeren mag, kann ich auf dessen Liebe verzichten.
__label__de	Im Urlaub habe ich immer nur an dich gedacht.
__label__de	An ihn kann ich mich leider nicht mehr erinnern.
__label__de	Ich kann mich nicht an das kalte Wetter gewöhnen.
__label__de	Danke, dass du an mich glaubst.
__label__de	Die Liebe ist langmütig und freundlich, die Liebe eifert nicht, die Liebe treibt nicht Mutwillen, sie blähet sich nicht, / sie stellet sich nicht ungebärdig, sie suchet nicht das Ihre, sie läßt sich nicht erbittern, sie rechnet das Böse nicht zu, / sie freuet sich nicht der Ungerechtigkeit, sie freuet sich aber der Wahrheit; / sie verträgt alles, sie glaubet alles, sie hoffet alles, sie duldet alles.
__label__de	Er sollte unbedingt etwas an seinem Aussehen ändern.
__label__de	Nun aber bleibt Glaube, Hoffnung, Liebe, diese drei; aber die Liebe ist die größte unter ihnen.
__label__de	Ich arbeite gerade an meiner Bikinifigur.
__label__de	Unsere Nachbarin leidet an einer schweren Krankheit.
__label__de	Es liegt an uns, diese Möglichkeit zu nutzen.
__label__de	Dass hier nicht die romantische Liebe, sondern die Nächstenliebe gemeint ist, erkennt man am lateinischen Text.
__label__de	Ich wusste, dass Anton gewinnen könnte.
__label__de	Ich habe keine Lust dazu und ich werde das nicht machen!
__label__de	Es ist eine gute App, um damit zu beginnen, Sport zu treiben.
__label__de	Wir sehen wenig Schnee hier.
__label__de	Die Tiefe des Flusses ist etwa zehn Meter.
__label__de	Bald wird die ganze Welt darüber Bescheid wissen.
__label__de	Tom kam völlig erschöpft zu Hause an.
__label__de	Das Ergebnis einer Forschung hängt davon ab, wer dafür bezahlt.
__label__de	Ich bin nicht so ein Morgenmensch wie du.
__label__de	Danke, dass Sie sich die Zeit nehmen, uns behilflich zu sein.
__label__de	Das Auto dort mit den zwei Männern steht schon eine Stunde.
__label__de	Vielen Dank für Ihren gestrigen Anruf.
__label__de	Ich frage mich, was Tom im Sinn hatte.
__label__de	Ich frage mich, was Tom im Sinn hat.
__label__de	Mit Schaufeln und im Akkord verheizt die Regierung das Geld der Steuerzahler.
__label__de	Wegen Marias Reden sind viele aus der Partei ausgetreten. Um die ist’s aber nicht schad’.
__label__de	Bei diesem Spiel kann jeder noch so kleine Fehler katastrophale Auswirkungen haben.
__label__de	Anders als im liberalen Königsberg herrschte in Göttingen ein starker Standesdünkel. Man hatte Tom davor gewarnt.
__label__de	Hans, zieh dir deine Jacke an und verabschiede dich von Paul. Wir müssen heim.
__label__de	Schon zehn Uhr. Wie schnell doch die Zeit vergeht!
__label__de	Ich habe Tom getötet.
__label__de	Ich bin hier, Tom.
__label__de	Wenn die Fische stumm sind, so sind dafür ihre Verkäuferinnen desto beredter.
__label__de	Ich habe das schon oft bemerkt; die Leute von Profession wissen oft das Beste nicht.
__label__de	Die Speisen haben vermutlich einen sehr großen Einfluß auf den Zustand der Menschen, wie er jetzo ist, der Wein äußert seinen Einfluss mehr sichtbar, die Speisen tun es langsamer, aber vielleicht ebenso gewiss, wer weiß, ob wir nicht einer gut gekochten Suppe die Luftpumpe und einer schlechten den Krieg oft zu verdanken haben.
__label__de	Es ist wahr. Esprit ist Nonsens, aber nicht jeder Nonsens ist Esprit.
__label__de	Ich fürchte, unsere allzu sorgfältige Erziehung liefert uns Zwergobst.
__label__de	Sagt, gibt es noch ein Land außer Deutschland, wo man die Nase eher rümpfen lernt als putzen?
__label__de	Er hatte gar keinen Charakter, sondern wenn er einen haben wollte, musste er immer erst einen annehmen.
__label__de	Erinnerungen sind Wirklichkeiten im Sonntagsanzug.
__label__de	Ich habe überlegt, was ich ihm sagen werde.
__label__de	Du hast gesagt, du würdest das schaffen.
__label__de	Er geht gewöhnlich zu Fuß zur Schule.
__label__de	Er wird morgens von seinem Vater mit dem Auto zur Schule gebracht.
__label__de	Weil neulich ein Kind auf dem Schulweg entführt wurde, wird Maria von ihrem Opa mit dem Auto hingebracht und auch wieder abgeholt.
__label__de	Sie ist gerade zu Hause.
__label__de	Bring zwei!
__label__de	Kann Russland taktische Atomwaffen gegen die Ukraine einsetzen?
__label__de	Maria trug ein billiges und viel zu starkes Parfum. Das ganze Treppenhaus stank danach.
__label__de	Maria zog eine Duftfahne hinter sich her. Ihr Parfum war viel zu stark und roch fürchterlich.
__label__de	Irgendwas läuft hier gehörig schief.
__label__de	Sie trinkt Tee mit etwas Milch.
__label__de	Ich will mehr Zeit.
__label__de	Fliegst du, oder fährst du mit dem Auto?
__label__de	Ich trinke morgens ein halbes Glas Milch.
__label__de	Mein Hörverständnis der französischen Sprache ist leider sehr schlecht.
__label__de	Hatten Sie keinen Plan?
__label__de	Jerusalem heißt auf Hebräisch „Jeruschalajim“.
__label__de	Ich spiele Dudelsack.
__label__de	Er ist in seinem Zimmer.
__label__de	Er ist auf seinem Zimmer.
__label__de	Dan hat sich für Linda gefreut.
__label__de	Ich habe es dir gestern gegeben.
__label__de	Er ist kein Finne.
__label__de	Sie greifen uns an.
__label__de	„Sprichst du Deutsch?“ – „Nein, ich bin Französin.“ – „Aber das schließt doch nicht aus, dass du Deutsch sprichst – ganz im Gegenteil!“ – „Sprichst du denn Französisch?“ – „Na klar!“
__label__de	„Sprichst du Deutsch?“ – „Nein, ich bin Französin.“
__label__de	Das ist eine finno-ugrische Sprache.
__label__de	Mit Tom kann man nicht verhandeln. An Absprachen hält er sich nicht, aber er respektiert Stärke, und die müssen wir ihm zeigen.
__label__de	„Wie sieht der Raum aller Geraden in der Ebene durch einen festen Punkt aus?“ – „Topologisch wie ein Kreis.“
__label__de	Das war das letzte Mal, dass ich ferngesehen habe.
__label__de	Sie haben eine seltsame Logik.
__label__de	Für mich ist das nicht genug.
__label__de	Das reicht mir nicht.
__label__de	Popeyes ist eine Restaurantkette.
__label__de	Welche Restaurantkette magst du?
__label__de	Wo ist die nächste Burger King-Filiale?
__label__de	In einigen Ländern sind iPhones Statussymbole.
__label__de	Sie ist Popsängerin.
__label__de	Sie singt wie eine Popsängerin.
__label__de	In einigen Ländern glauben die Menschen, dass Apple-Produkte Symbole des Imperialismus sind.
__label__de	Wie kann man diese Wahnsinnigen stoppen?
__label__de	Er ist jetzt nicht zu Hause.
__label__de	Du hast es fast erraten.
__label__de	Sie haben es fast erraten.
__label__de	Ich bin einer deiner Freunde.
__label__de	Kates Freundin heißt Emily.
__label__de	Sie verwenden die Demoversion dieser Software.
__label__de	Er lebt gerne mit seiner Frau zusammen.
__label__de	Die Kinder essen gerne Eiscreme.
__label__de	Wie können Sie ihn hören?
__label__de	Wie kannst du ihn hören?
__label__de	Wie könnt ihr ihn hören?
__label__de	Wie kann man ihn hören?
__label__de	Ein sicheres Zeichen von einem guten Buch ist, wenn es einem immer besser gefällt, je älter man wird.
__label__de	Ein Buch ist ein Spiegel. Wenn ein Affe hineinguckt, so kann kein Apostel heraussehen.
__label__de	Bei manchem Werk eines berühmten Mannes möchte ich lieber lesen, was er weggestrichen hat, als was er hat stehen lassen.
__label__de	Seine Aussprache war so wie des Demosthenes seine, wenn er das Maul voller Kieselsteine hatte.
__label__de	Ich kann freilich nicht sagen, ob es besser werden wird, wenn es anders wird; aber so viel kann ich sagen, es muss anders werden, wenn es gut werden soll.
__label__de	Wer Menschen ändern will, kann sie nicht schonen.
__label__de	Das gestern Abend tut mir leid.
__label__de	Meine Mama hat meine Schwester lieber als mich.
__label__de	Kinder sind ein Beweis der eigenen Existenz. Sie beweisen, dass man gelebt hat, und sie lassen einen über den eigenen Tod hinaus weiterleben.
__label__de	Ein Auto kam an.
__label__de	Gemäß den Kommunisten sind Coca-Cola und McDonald's Symbole des Imperialismus.
__label__de	Trinkst du gerne Coca-Cola?
__label__de	Dieses Land hat dem Imperialismus gehorcht.
__label__de	Diese Pflanze ist gefährlich zu essen.
__label__de	Da diese Pflanze gefährlich ist, sollte man sie nicht essen.
__label__de	Ich aß viel Fleisch.
__label__de	Wenn es regnet, habe ich einen Regenschirm.
__label__de	Welche Flagge ist weiß, rot und blau?
__label__de	Bücher zu kaufen ist teuer.
__label__de	Wir müssen Zeitungen kaufen, um zu wissen, was los ist.
__label__de	Wir haben ein interessantes Buch auf Deutsch.
__label__de	Die bosnische Sprache ist ein Zweig der serbokroatischen Sprache.
__label__de	Im Bus wurde mir ein Portemonnaie gestohlen.
__label__de	Mein Portemonnaie wurde im Bus gestohlen.
__label__de	Im Bus wurde mir meine Brieftasche gestohlen.
__label__de	Meine Brieftasche wurde im Bus gestohlen.
__label__de	Woraus besteht unsere heutige Tagesordnung?
__label__de	Yanni war auf dem Konzert.
__label__de	Malka ist eine gute Sängerin.
__label__de	Ich will schöne Momente erleben.
__label__de	Wir gingen auf die Suche nach Gold.
__label__de	Das ist ein Strassenköter.
__label__de	Ich bin kein Chinese.
__label__de	Sie arbeitet als eine Krankenschwester in einem örtlichen Krankenhaus.
__label__de	Grün.
__label__de	Ich möchte ein Sandwich, bitte.
__label__de	Ich möchte gerne ein Sandwich, bitte.
__label__de	Wo hast du diesen Ananassaft gekauft?
__label__de	Es gibt eine Zeit der Geburt und eine Zeit des Sterbens.
__label__de	Tom konnte nicht sein Mittagessen beenden.
__label__de	Ich hatte keine Gelegenheit, diesen Film anzusehen.
__label__de	Ich hatte noch keine Chance diesen Film zu sehen.
__label__de	Ich bin nicht Darth Vader.
__label__de	Komm zu mir nach Hause.
__label__de	Einen Ananassaft, bitte.
__label__de	Gerne einen Ananassaft.
__label__de	Es ist in der Theorie möglich, aber es ist sehr schwer in der Praxis.
__label__de	In der Theorie ist es möglich, aber sehr schwer in der Praxis.
__label__de	Wir sind alle wild darauf, den Film zu sehen.
__label__de	Tom fährt das Auto.
__label__de	Wir gingen zusammen bis nach Boston.
__label__de	Wir gingen zusammen bis zu Boston.
__label__de	Endlich habe ich eine Stelle bekommen.
__label__de	Endlich habe ich einen Job gekriegt.
__label__de	Endlich habe ich eine Arbeit bekommen.
__label__de	Sie ist nicht hässlich.
__label__de	Ich wollte Tom mit seinen Rechnungen helfen.
__label__de	Joghurt wird aus Milch und Sahne hergestellt.
__label__de	Ich frage mich, ob Tom so gerne tanzt wie Maria.
__label__de	Wir müssen die Verkehrsregeln einhalten.
__label__de	Ich hatte keine Absicht zu beleidigen.
__label__de	Es war nicht meine Absicht zu beleidigen.
__label__de	Er legte ein Kieselstein auf das Papier.
__label__de	Noch.
__label__de	Ich habe einen Jagdhund.
__label__de	Ich wusste nicht, dass Fussball solch ein gefährlicher Sport ist.
__label__de	Ich denke nicht, dass du Tom sagen solltest, was er zu machen hat.
__label__de	Tom wurde ein Held.
__label__de	Welche Gitarre ist die von Tom?
__label__de	Welche ist Toms Gitarre?
__label__de	Die Partie ist heute Abend in Toms Haus.
__label__de	Die Party ist heute Abend im Haus von Tom.
__label__de	Ich kann dir nicht sofort antworten.
__label__de	Tom kann man einigermassen vertrauen.
__label__de	Wie sagt man das auf Bosnisch?
__label__de	Ich bin mit seiner SMS vollkommen einverstanden.
__label__de	Was für ein wundervoller Tag!
__label__de	Was für ein grossartiger Tag!
__label__de	Wir werden morgen mit ihnen über das Problem sprechen.
__label__de	Wir werden morgen mit Ihnen das Problem besprechen.
__label__de	Wir werden morgen mit Ihnen über das Problem sprechen.
__label__de	Wo ist der Brigadier?
__label__de	Mostar ist eine sehr schöne Stadt.
__label__de	Man sagt: Hunde bellen, aber Leute reisen.
__label__de	Ich bin infiziert.
__label__de	Gestern verbrachte ich den ganzen Tag im Bett.
__label__de	Es schien, als ob sie wussten, was sie wollten.
__label__de	Ich bin mir sicher, dass ihr zwei euch einigen werdet.
__label__de	Er hat endlich meinen Wunsch erfüllt.
__label__de	Er hat endlich meine Forderung erfüllt.
__label__de	Der Keller, in dem ich war, fing plötzlich an ganz schön und warm auszusehen.
__label__de	Er ist ein Aristokrat.
__label__de	Er hat bei der Biologieprüfung gemogelt.
__label__de	Er hat bei der Biologieprüfung betrogen.
__label__de	Ich sehe nichts Komisches.
__label__de	Ich sehe nichts Ungewöhnliches.
__label__de	Wo ist Banja Luka?
__label__de	Die Gesundheit ist ein Schatz.
__label__de	Miss dreimal, schneide einmal.
__label__de	Das ist das Buch, das ich gestern gekauft habe.
__label__de	Das ist das Buch, welches ich gestern gekauft habe.
__label__de	Du bist so weiss!
__label__de	Was ich jetzt möchte, ist ein Glas kaltes Wasser.
__label__de	Das, was ich jetzt möchte, ist ein Glas kaltes Wasser.
__label__de	Es braucht einen Stein.
__label__de	Ein Stein ist nötig.
__label__de	Tom wusste, dass Maria ihn nicht mag.
__label__de	Das ist das Hemd meines Vaters.
__label__de	Sprich nicht mit ihm während er fährt.
__label__de	Es gibt subtile Unterschiede zwischen den beiden Bildern.
__label__de	Gibt es eine Hundenhüttestrasse?
__label__de	Tom hört seine Nachrichten auf dem Telefon ab.
__label__de	Wir weigerten uns, aber Tom ist sowieso weggegangen.
__label__de	Mein Vater ist jetzt auf einer Mission.
__label__de	Komm in mein Haus.
__label__de	Er hat all seine Fehler beglichen.

__label__de	Istanbul hat über 16 Millionen Einwohner.
__label__de	Die Flügel des Schmetterlings ähneln den Blütenblättern einer durchsichtigen Blume.
__label__de	Dreißig Monate sind zweieinhalb Jahre.
__label__de	Findest du dich zurecht?
__label__de	Das wäre mir alles recht.
__label__de	Klingt alles gut, würde ich alles nehmen.
__label__de	Der Schmetterling ist eine leichte Blume, die fliegt.
__label__de	Tom verließ den Kurs, weil er seinen Lehrer nicht ausstehen konnte.
__label__de	Ich habe eine Million Fragen.
__label__de	Was bedeutet der Ausdruck „Lichtjahr"?
__label__de	Bitte warten Sie einen Augenblick.
__label__de	Ist das idiomatisch?
__label__de	Was wäre besser?
__label__de	Warum hast du getrunken?
__label__de	Ich hätte nicht gedacht, dass Thomas gewinnen könnte.
__label__de	Ich bin lieber hier als zu Hause.
__label__de	Lange habe ich meine Muttersprache nicht gesprochen.
__label__de	Ich kannte sowohl den Autor als auch das Buch.
__label__de	Warum hast du uns nicht vorgestellt?
__label__de	Erinnern Sie sich, was letztes Jahr passiert ist?
__label__de	Die Kinder haben an die Wand Schmetterlinge gezeichnet.
__label__de	Ich habe meine Tasche zu Hause gelassen.
__label__de	Ich hatte meine Schlüssel nicht dabei, deshalb bin durch das Fenster eingestiegen.
__label__de	Sie brachten mir einen Korb mit frischem Obst.
__label__de	Entschuldigung, ich habe es komplett vergessen.
__label__de	Ich will keine so dumme Frau haben.
__label__de	Das scheint missverstanden worden zu sein.
__label__de	Vergiss bitte, was ich geschrieben habe!
__label__de	Diese Welt würde es nicht ohne Medien geben.
__label__de	In Ungarn regieren immer noch die Kommunisten.
__label__de	Der Raum war in Dunkelheit gehüllt.
__label__de	Die Wahrheit ist eine Lüge.
__label__de	Tom konnte nichts sagen, er rülpste nur zweimal.
__label__de	Die Vase ist vom Tisch gefallen.
__label__de	Medien sind eine Waffe.
__label__de	Sie ist vom Tisch gefallen, aber nicht zerbrochen.
__label__de	Die Jugend ist stark und widersteht Schlägen. Das Alter erfordert jedoch eine gute Pflege.
__label__de	Wann habe ich sowas gesagt?
__label__de	Ich war bei ihr glücklich.
__label__de	Wir waren kein Jahr zusammen.
__label__de	Ich habe mich verzählt.
__label__de	Wie viel bezahlst du für Zigaretten?
__label__de	Das ist kein gutes Beispiel.
__label__de	Anderswo bezahlt man mich fürs Saubermachen.
__label__de	„Wo ist denn Mamas Eichhörnchenfigur?“ – „Die ist Oma gestern beim Staubwischen vom Regal gefallen und kaputtgegangen.“ – „Und da habt ihr sie weggeworfen?“ – „Nein, die Teile liegen in der Schublade.“
__label__de	„Hier stehen so viele Porzellanfigürchen herum. Wenn eine davon fehlt, merkt Mama das doch nicht.“ – „O doch, das merkt sie. Verlass dich drauf!“
__label__de	Was kannst du noch für Sprachen?
__label__de	Kannst du noch andere Sprachen?
__label__de	Ich will nicht, dass er sich Sorgen macht.
__label__de	Ich will ihm keine Sorgen machen.
__label__de	Tom sprach mit vollem Mund.
__label__de	Der Pizzabäcker warf den Teig.
__label__de	„Ich war völlig schockiert“, sagte er.
__label__de	Tom wich Marias Kuss aus.
__label__de	In Istanbul lebt ein Fünftel der türkischen Bevölkerung.
__label__de	Ehe er nach Japan reiste, besuchte der Papst Thailand, um eine Botschaft der religiösen Duldsamkeit und des Friedens zu predigen.
__label__de	Sie lehnte alle Heiratsanträge ab.
__label__de	Hast du mal Toms Telefon gesehen?
__label__de	Tom spielte mit den Puppen.
__label__de	Große Jungen weinen nicht.
__label__de	Es darf nicht bei allem nur ums Geld gehen.
__label__de	Die Straßen in dieser Stadt sind eng.
__label__de	Für Autofahrer ist die Innenstadt ein Alptraum aus engen Einbahnstraßen.
__label__de	Da erkannte der König, wie lieb ihn seine Königin hatte, und holte sie wieder zu sich auf sein Schloss, und da lebten sie glücklich bis an ihrer Tage Ende.
__label__de	Die Menschen neigen zu der Annahme, dass es Hunden sehr wichtig sei, wie es einem gehe. Wir wollten nun herausfinden, ob sich das wissenschaftlich würde belegen lassen.
__label__de	Ich würde mich gern mit dir über deine neue Leidenschaft unterhalten.
__label__de	Du solltest über alles, was ich dir gerade gesagt habe, noch einmal nachdenken.
__label__de	„Hallo, Anna! Ich wollte dich fragen, ob du es dir schon überlegt hast.“ – „Überlegt? Was soll ich mir denn überlegt haben?“ – „Ach, das weißt du doch.“ – „Nein, das weiß ich nicht. Hilf meinem Gedächtnis mal auf die Sprünge!“
__label__de	Der Zuschauerraum war voll.
__label__de	Kann ich Ihnen etwas zu trinken bringen?
__label__de	Dieses Buch ist zu verkaufen.
__label__de	Alte Fotos sind dazu da, Erinnerungen zu wecken. Wer sie sich anschaut, der will sich erinnern.
__label__de	Wie viele Bücher haben Sie verkauft?
__label__de	Recht ist eine Sache, Geschäfte machen eine andere.
__label__de	Du hast den sowieso nicht gemocht.
__label__de	Die Schmidt ist eine alte Jungfer. Die hat nie einen abbekommen. Das sieht man doch schon von weitem.
__label__de	Spiel doch Schubert oder Mozart und nicht diesen dissonanten Kram!
__label__de	Paris ist Klasse! Da musst du unbedingt mal hin.
__label__de	„Hab’ ich einen Hunger! Was gibt es denn?“ – „Kartoffelsuppe.“
__label__de	„Na, wie weit seid ihr?“ – „Wir sind mittendrin.“ – „Ach, ich dachte, ihr wärt schon fast fertig.“
__label__de	Wir müssen versuchen, uns wie zwei erwachsene Menschen zu benehmen.
__label__de	Liebst du ihn eigentlich, deinen Hans, oder darf ich das nicht fragen?
__label__de	Er ist nicht meine erste, meine größte Liebe; die war dein Vater. Aber ich liebe ihn.
__label__de	Sie hat niemals gelogen.
__label__de	Tom lügt aus Prinzip.
__label__de	Jeder Verkäufer hat die Kunden, die er verdient.
__label__de	Verkäufer bist du immer und überall.
__label__de	Was ich suche, ist hier im Link beschrieben.
__label__de	Könnte dieser Begriff übernommen werden?
__label__de	Hier wird allerdings das ethische Problem behandelt.
__label__de	Wo kann ich ein Auto mieten?
__label__de	Ihr habt mir viel geholfen.
__label__de	Wo kann man bezahlen?
__label__de	Ich halte es für gut.
__label__de	Das ist ein Wirtschaftskrieg.
__label__de	Ich bin eine Freiwillige.
__label__de	Immer wenn ich nach Hause komme, erwische ich dich beim Videospielen.
__label__de	Das soll das letzte Mal gewesen sein, dass du in diesem Ton mit mir sprichst!
__label__de	Glaub ja nicht, dass du ungeschoren davonkommst!
__label__de	Dieses Mal lass ich’s dir durchgehen.
__label__de	Kannst du einen Moment aufhören, mich zu nerven?
__label__de	Für wen hältst du dich eigentlich, dass du so mit mir redest?
__label__de	Das ist das erste Mal, dass mir das passiert.
__label__de	Ich kann mich nicht erinnern, wann ich zum letzten Mal mit meinem Vater fischen gegangen bin.
__label__de	Ich bin zum Arzt gegangen und es wurde eine Angina bei mir festgestellt.
__label__de	Ich hoffe, beim nächsten Mal denkst du zweimal nach, bevor du handelst.
__label__de	Die stark alkoholisierte Lenkerin beging Fahrerinnenflucht.
__label__de	„Wo ist Bello?“ – „Liegt der nicht in seinem Körbchen?“
__label__de	Die Familie Müller hat Schlimmes durchgemacht, aber solche Schicksalsschläge sind Prüfungen, die uns auferlegt werden, um sie zu bestehen, und nicht, um sie auf ewig zu beklagen.
__label__de	Frau Müller wartet auf Sie in ihrem Zimmer. Die Fahrstühle sind da drüben. Vierter Stock, Zimmer 423.
__label__de	„Entschuldigen Sie. Wo sind bitte die Fahrstühle?“ – „Gleich da drüben.“
__label__de	„Die Fahrstühle sind außer Betrieb. Wir müssen die Treppe nehmen.“ – „Bis in den 14. Stock? Na bravo!“
__label__de	„Was ist denn das für eine Sprache, die die Leute da sprechen?“ – „Griechisch.“
__label__de	Ich weiß, was du letzten Sommer getan hast.
__label__de	Ich weiß, was Sie letzten Sommer getan haben.
__label__de	Ich weiß, was ihr letzten Sommer gemacht habt.
__label__de	„Onkel Fritz ist gestürzt – Oberschenkelhalsbruch.“ – „Oberschenkelhalsbruch? Das kann eine langwierige Angelegenheit werden.“
__label__de	Lasst euch von Annas Spiel nicht einschüchtern! Was die kann, das könnt ihr noch gar nicht können. Ihr fangt ja mit der Schauspielerei gerade erst an.
__label__de	Ich möchte mich scheiden lassen.
__label__de	Hans sagte wie aus heiterem Himmel zu seiner Frau, er wolle sich scheiden lassen.
__label__de	Hans traf sich mit seiner Ex, die er immer noch liebte, und er machte seiner Frau gegenüber auch überhaupt kein Geheimnis daraus.
__label__de	Tom ist ein Schwein, dass er seine Frau so behandelt!
__label__de	Wenn Sie noch einmal vor der Entscheidung stünden, würden Sie noch einmal heiraten?
__label__de	„Du weißt schon, dass Anna die ganze Hand nimmt, wenn du ihr den kleinen Finger reichst, oder?“ – „Soll ich sie in ihrer Not allein lassen?“
__label__de	Ein intelligentes Kind darf man nicht unterfordern.
__label__de	Benutze die Gabel.
__label__de	Lassen Sie Ihre Kinder spielen.
__label__de	Ich mag die Farbe deiner Lippen.
__label__de	Du hast mich bald vergessen, du wankelmütiges Weib!
__label__de	Ob Tom es gewollt hat oder nicht – es ist leider passiert.
__label__de	Unsere Ansprüche sind so verschieden, dass wir nur miteinander auskommen können, wenn wir zu Kompromissen bereit sind.
__label__de	Sie sind immer nur aggressiv. Aggressivität verhindert das Nachdenken, und genau das sollten Sie tun – nachdenken, und zwar gründlich!
__label__de	Wenera-7 war eine Raumsonde, der es gelang, auf der Venusoberfläche zu landen.
__label__de	Es ist viele Jahre her, dass die Berliner Mauer fiel.
__label__de	Aus Furcht, mich zu versehen, mache ich alles falsch.
__label__de	Ist es erlaubt, hier von Liebe zu sprechen?
__label__de	Darf man hier von Liebe sprechen?
__label__de	Ich kann ihnen viel danken.
__label__de	Denk an die Zukunft und nicht zurück!
__label__de	Was ist die schönste Sprache, um über die Liebe zu sprechen?
__label__de	In welcher Sprache ist es schöner, von der Liebe zu sprechen?
__label__de	Ich wähle Französisch als die Sprache der Liebe.
__label__de	Tom hat Maria in der Nacht, als das passierte, angerufen.
__label__de	Und in meiner Brust herrscht eine tiefe Leere, weil du weg bist und mich niemand mehr liebt.
__label__de	Darf ich sie öffnen?
__label__de	Was für wunderschöne Lippen!
__label__de	Was du mir angetan hast, lässt sich mit Worten allein nicht wiedergutmachen.
__label__de	Eine Mutter tut für ihr Kind alles.
__label__de	Sie können heute Nacht hier bleiben.
__label__de	Du kannst heute Nacht hier bleiben.
__label__de	Sie können hier übernachten.
__label__de	Ihr könnt heute Nacht hierbleiben.
__label__de	Niemand weiß jemals, was passieren könnte.
__label__de	Man weiß nie, was passieren könnte.
__label__de	Der allmächtige Löwe bemeisterte sich eines Gnus.
__label__de	Der allmächtige Löwe überwältigte ein Gnu.
__label__de	Nach einem kurzen Gefecht bemächtigten wir uns der Stadt.
__label__de	Der Staat ist kein guter Wirtschafter.
__label__de	Der Staat bezahlt eigentlich gar nichts, er verteilt nur das Geld der Steuerzahler – und zwar nicht wirklich gut.
__label__de	Ich habe keinen Löffel.
__label__de	Ich will ihn nicht heiraten!
__label__de	Es wurde meins.
__label__de	Ich schaue mir diese Serie nicht an.
__label__de	Tom hat ins Töpfchen gekackt!
__label__de	Ich möchte, dass mich jemand liebt.
__label__de	Nein, niemand will dich singen hören.
__label__de	Nein, niemand will Sie singen hören.
__label__de	Nein, niemand will euch singen hören.
__label__de	Das Wetter hält sich.
__label__de	Karl Marx war kein Marxist.
__label__de	Tom muss das Konzept erstellen und es von seinem Chef absegnen lassen.
__label__de	Maria muss einige Tage hierbleiben.
__label__de	Ich will einfach sicherstellen, dass du vorbereitet bist.
__label__de	Er ist nicht wie ihr.
__label__de	Er ist nicht wie du.
__label__de	Sie ist nicht wie ihr.
__label__de	Sie ist nicht wie du.
__label__de	Jesus war kein Christ.
__label__de	Dort, wo ich herkomme, zählt das Wort des Vaters noch sehr viel, und wenn man sich gegen die Familie stellt, muss man gehen, und zwar für immer.
__label__de	Nachdem Hans gegangen war, warf sich Anna auf ihr Bett und weinte.
__label__de	Tom verließ seine ihn liebende Frau für eine andere, die ihn nach kurzer Zeit sitzenließ.
__label__de	Du darfst Anna erst am Hochzeitsmorgen im Brautkleid sehen. Alles andere bringt Unglück.
__label__de	Diese Hochzeit macht mich nicht froh. Ich will mich freuen, aber ich kann nicht.
__label__de	Papa will uns sehen.
__label__de	Es ist gut, sich immer an die Bosheit der Menschen zu erinnern.
__label__de	Zu Weihnachten wird im Hause Müller immer musiziert.
__label__de	Ich werde keine Zeit zum Kochen haben.
__label__de	Ich wäre euch für jeden Hinweis sehr dankbar.
__label__de	Verkaufen ist nicht Technik, Verkaufen ist Emotion.
__label__de	Du wirst nicht als Verkäufer geboren. Du wirst Verkäufer durch tägliches Training.
__label__de	Der sicherste Verkaufserfolg ist: Die Bedürfnisse deiner Kunden zu erkennen.
__label__de	Referenzen sind besser als 1000 Verkaufsargumente.
__label__de	Erfolg hängt immer von deiner inneren Haltung ab.
__label__de	Für das Preisgespräch gilt: Keine Leistung ohne Gegenleistung.
__label__de	Was du nicht verkaufst, verkauft ein anderer.
__label__de	Einwände sind nichts anderes als ein klares Kaufsignal.
__label__de	Danke für die Bemerkung!
__label__de	Der Konflikt in der Ukraine geht ins vierte Jahr, und ein Ende ist nicht in Sicht.
__label__de	Hör auf, mich Fräulein Neunmalklug zu nennen!
__label__de	Ist mehr immer besser?
__label__de	Tom war ganz aus dem Häuschen.
__label__de	Wir können nicht draußen spielen, weil es regnet.
__label__de	Vertraue deinem Freund nicht zu sehr.
__label__de	Warum sprichst du mit dem Wind? Du verschwendest Zeit!
__label__de	Warum verschwendest du deine Zeit? Du sprichst mit dem Wind!
__label__de	Sie sparten sich Ärger und Kosten, indem sie es selbst taten.
__label__de	Ich mag diese Äpfel.
__label__de	Unverzüglich wird sich eine weitere Tür öffnen.
__label__de	Erzählen wir unseren Eltern noch nichts davon.
__label__de	Ich kenne keinen Tom.
__label__de	Kannst du dich heute Nachmittag um das Baby kümmern?
__label__de	Im Gegensatz zur Gitarre hat die Oud keine Bünde.
__label__de	Wie auch die Geige hat die Oud keine Bünde.
__label__de	Bewegung ist für Hunde von lebenswichtiger Bedeutung.
__label__de	Er ist Pflegehelfer.
__label__de	Ihr Kollege ist im Hol- und Bringdienst.
__label__de	Er ist Rettungsfahrer.
__label__de	Ich habe einen Termin beim Augenarzt vereinbart.
__label__de	Warst du bei einem Optiker?
__label__de	Meine Freundin ist Dermatologin.
__label__de	Um fair zu sein, nehmen Sie den geraden Weg.
__label__de	Was hieltest du von einem gemeinsamen Mittagessen? Wir könnten doch zu irgendeinem guten Italiener in der Stadt gehen.
__label__de	„Im Januar zieht Hans aus. Das hat er versprochen.“ – „Wenn Hans etwas verspricht, dann heißt das noch gar nichts.“
__label__de	Das ist gut; das ist sehr gut; das ist famos!
__label__de	Dreht euch um!
__label__de	Geht an die Tafel!
__label__de	Geh auf deinen Platz!
__label__de	Geht auf eure Plätze zurück!
__label__de	Das Firmenimperium manipuliert durch Schulden, Bestechung und politischen Umsturz – das heißt Globalisation.
__label__de	Ist es besser so?
__label__de	Das kannst du aber besser!
__label__de	Schreibt das Datum.
__label__de	Räum dein Heft weg!
__label__de	Mach dein Buch auf!
__label__de	Wer vor der Zeit beginnt, der endigt früh.
__label__de	Sorge für die Gesundheit deines Leibes und deiner Seele, aber verzärtele beide nicht.
__label__de	Die Lösung ist genial einfach, aber man muss erst mal drauf kommen.
__label__de	Herr Yoshida kennt sich gut in der französischen Geschichte aus.
__label__de	Diese Lösung des Problems ist genial einfach und einfach genial.
__label__de	Ich möchte heute in mein Tagebuch schreiben.
__label__de	Sie werden nicht kommen, selbst wenn sie es könnten.
__label__de	Ich hoffe, wir fliegen heute.
__label__de	Schwimme nicht zu weit raus.
__label__de	Ich möchte bis an mein Lebensende singen können.
__label__de	Wie bei so vielem gilt: Einmal ist keinmal. Aber wenn das noch öfter passiert, solltest du zum Arzt gehen.
__label__de	Man sollte einen Haufen lesen, aber keinen Mist.
__label__de	Sie wird mir gehören.
__label__de	Guten Tag, Kinder!
__label__de	Wer fehlt heute?
__label__de	Wie viele Schüler fehlen?
__label__de	Geniale Übersetzung!
__label__de	Der Titel „Schmutzigster Mann der Welt“ geht nun auf einen – gar nicht so unansehnlichen – Inder über, der angeblich seit über 50 Jahren nicht geduscht hat. Über die schmutzigste Frau der Welt wird nichts berichtet.
__label__de	Stellt euch zu zweit auf.
__label__de	Weißt du, wem diese Krawatte gehören könnte?
__label__de	„Weißt du, wem diese Krawatte gehören könnte?“ – „Das wird deine sein.“ – „Meine? Das wüsste ich aber!“
__label__de	„Weißt du, wem diese Krawatte gehören könnte?“ – „Dem Design nach würde ich auf Opa tippen.“ – „Das kann nicht sein! Der lässt seine Krawatten nicht einfach irgendwo liegen.“ – „Dann kommt eigentlich nur noch Tom in Frage, denn Papa trägt ja keine Krawatten.“
__label__de	Man muss viel lesen, aber sorgfältig die Lektüre wählen.
__label__de	Man soll viel lesen, aber nicht jeden Mist.
__label__de	Die Politiker leben wie Könige, das Volk hingegen immer schlechter.
__label__de	Wenn in einem deutschen Satz kein Komma steht, muss man ihn besonders sorgfältig überprüfen.
__label__de	Kokospalmen umgaben das Restaurant.
__label__de	Ich hoffe, sie sieht es morgen früh.
__label__de	Ich kann ihm antworten, aber ich will nicht.
__label__de	Die Gewinner des Krieges sind die steinreichen Investoren und Spekulanten.
__label__de	Sie werden sie nicht wiedersehen.
__label__de	Du wirst sie nicht wiedersehen.
__label__de	Du musst sie vergessen.
__label__de	Sie müssen sie vergessen.
__label__de	Kann man in geeigneter Weise Kurven höheren Grades parametrisieren?
__label__de	Fermat war ein großer Amateurmathematiker.
__label__de	Wo kann ich diese Kiste hinstellen?
__label__de	Er war in der Welt, und obwohl die Welt durch ihn geschaffen wurde, hat die Welt ihn nicht erkannt.
__label__de	Ich bin die Stimme dessen, der in der Wüste weint.
__label__de	Seht das Lamm Gottes, das die Sünde der Welt wegnimmt!
__label__de	Ich sah den Geist wie eine Taube vom Himmel herabsteigen und auf ihm ruhen.
__label__de	Mein Land hat wunderbare Strände.
__label__de	Ich kaufe oft im türkischen Laden ein Fladenbrot.
__label__de	Die Politiker sind verantwortlich für die heutige Situation.
__label__de	Das könntest du selber tun.
__label__de	Ich verstehe nicht, warum er das macht.
__label__de	Ich verstehe nicht, warum sie das macht.
__label__de	Ich verstehe nicht, warum Sie das machen.
__label__de	Sie ist schon über vierzig und hat immer noch keinen Ehemann gefunden.
__label__de	Nimm nicht, was nicht dir gehört!
__label__de	Die Diener sollen es sofort alle erfahren!
__label__de	Ich habe immer Mineralwasser dabei.
__label__de	Wir sprangen alle zusammen ins Schwimmbecken.
__label__de	Für das Buch habe ich 800 Yen bezahlt.
__label__de	Mein Bruder wurde misshandelt.
__label__de	Es gibt jede Menge zu tun.
__label__de	Hol sofort Tom!
__label__de	Tom karikierte Maria.
__label__de	Ich habe Tom karikiert.
__label__de	Ich habe dafür schon eine Menge Geld ausgegeben, aber es gehört mir immer noch nicht.
__label__de	Wie könnte man einen Fahrstuhl ins Weltall instand halten?
__label__de	Bin ich schon tot?
__label__de	Wir müssen einander verstehen.
__label__de	Wir müssen zu einer Verständigung kommen.
__label__de	Tom hat mit Twitter aufgehört.
__label__de	Sein Fotoapparat ist dreimal so teuer wie meiner.
__label__de	Es ist immer schön, einen Helfer im Haus zu haben.
__label__de	Wenn wir doch nur eine Firma fänden, die unser Rennen finanziell unterstützte!
__label__de	Der Siedler wird nicht auf dich hören. Er hat sich hier bereits häuslich eingerichtet.
__label__de	So etwas würde Tom nicht sagen.
__label__de	Ich habe für die Hauptrolle vorgespielt.
__label__de	Ich höre ein Kind weinen.
__label__de	Ich riet Tom mitzumachen.
__label__de	Ich rate euch beiden mitzumachen.
__label__de	Leicht wird’s nicht sein, Tom zu finden.
__label__de	Niemand hat Tom eingeladen.
__label__de	Tom kam strahlend zum Französischunterricht.
__label__de	In den Naturwissenschaften ist die zappelnde Fliege oft der einzige Beweis für die Existenz eines Spinnennetzes.
__label__de	„Unser Sohn arbeitet nicht gern und er kann eigentlich nichts. Aber Geld für Dummheiten würde er schon gern ausgeben! Was könnte er werden?“ – „Âhm, Politiker?“
__label__de	Sie war in Sicherheit.
__label__de	Die Amerikaner sind im großen und ganzen ein redseliges Volk.
__label__de	Umweltbewusstsein!? Die Kunden wollen keine Haushaltsgeräte, die binnen fünf Jahren kaputtgehen, kaufen!
__label__de	Timo hat mit seinem Dampfdruckreiniger die Kellertreppe saubergemacht und dabei alles eingenebelt.
__label__de	Erbarme dich meiner, Gott, in deiner Barmherzigkeit, und in der Fülle deines Erbarmens tilge meine Sünde.
__label__de	Man läuft Gefahr, unter die Räder zu geraten, wenn man andere Argumente bringt, andere Meinungen äußert als die, die den Mainstream in Politik und Medien bilden. Man muss die Argumente ja nicht teilen, aber sie von vornherein nicht zuzulassen oder als Propaganda zu diskreditieren schadet der Demokratie.
__label__de	Die Dinge sind selten so schwarzweiß, wie sie der Einfachheit halber oft dargestellt werden.
__label__de	Es lässt sich, mit ernstzunehmenden Argumenten auf beiden Seiten, trefflich darüber streiten, ob es gerechte Kriege gibt.
__label__de	Ob es gerechte Kriege gibt, darüber lässt sich, mit ernstzunehmenden Argumenten auf beiden Seiten, trefflich streiten.
__label__de	Die Politiker tanzen, wie die Großkapitalisten pfeifen.
__label__de	Ich habe eigentlich für mich eine Ehefrau gefunden, sie gehört aber einem anderen.
__label__de	Hin und wieder schützt ein wenig Selbstreflexion vor Radikalisierung.
__label__de	Tom hörte traurige Musik.
__label__de	Er zeigt mir den Weg zum Flughafen.
__label__de	Meine Eltern wollen, dass ich nach Hause zurückkomme.
__label__de	Wie schön sind die Täler im Frühling!
__label__de	Ich liebe meine Tanten.
__label__de	Die Person hat ziemlich viel Hüftgold.
__label__de	Ich habe gerade echt Muffensausen.
__label__de	Die Mutter Jesu war dabei, und auch Jesus und seine Jünger waren zur Hochzeit eingeladen worden.
__label__de	Tom griff nach unten und streichelte seinen Hund.
__label__de	Erzählen Sie meinem jungen Freund eine schöne Geschichte.
__label__de	Anfangs waren wir alle von Toms Unschuld überzeugt.
__label__de	Das lässt ihn kalt.
__label__de	Dieses Mal drücke ich ein Auge zu.
__label__de	Als der Wein aufgebraucht war, sagte die Mutter von Jesus zu ihm: "Sie haben keinen Wein mehr".
__label__de	Mary glaubt, sie könne singen.
__label__de	Mary glaubt, dass sie singen kann.
__label__de	Wie weit ist es bis zum Strand?
__label__de	Aber Jesus sagte zu ihr: Frau, was habe ich mit dir zu tun? Meine Stunde ist noch nicht gekommen.
__label__de	In der Nähe befanden sich sechs steinerne Krüge, die von den Juden für zeremonielle Waschungen verwendet wurden und jeweils zwanzig bis dreißig Gallonen enthielten.
__label__de	Jesus sagte zu den Dienern: "Füllt die Krüge mit Wasser", und sie füllten sie bis zum Rand.
__label__de	Du missverstehst mich.
__label__de	Einer Umfrage zufolge vertrauen die Afrikaner am meisten ihren lokalen Häuptlingen und am wenigsten ihren Vertretern in den nationalen Parlamenten und ihrem Präsidenten.
__label__de	Dann sagte er zu ihnen: "Schöpft nun etwas davon und bringt es dem Herrn des Festmahls." Das taten sie.
__label__de	Eigentlich ist Afrika reich; dieser Reichtum landet aber bis auf wenige Ausnahmen bei den lokalen Fürsten, während die Bevölkerung arm gehalten wird.
__label__de	Der 79jährige ist während der COVID-19-Pandemie als führende wissenschaftliche Stimme der Vernunft und des Trostes aufgetreten.
__label__de	Huskies vertragen sich gut mit Kindern und anderen Hunden.
__label__de	Ich weiß, dass er mich leiden mag.
__label__de	Die Anna ist ein so hübsches und liebes Mädchen, aber Hans mag sie nicht leiden.
__label__de	Er konnte nicht den Blick von ihr lassen.
__label__de	Maria schüttete Tom, um ihn zu wecken, kaltes Wasser ins Gesicht.
__label__de	Ich weiß, dass du lieber woanders wärest.
__label__de	Als Jugendlicher war Tom in eine berühmte Schauspielerin verknallt.
__label__de	Was denkt sie wohl?
__label__de	Es ist viel größer, als ich dachte.
__label__de	Tom trinkt gern Espresso.
__label__de	Tom lud alle seine Freunde zu einem weihnachtlichen Abendessen bei sich zu Hause ein.
__label__de	Versucht noch einmal!
__label__de	Und der Herr des Gastmahls kostete von dem Wasser, das in Wein verwandelt worden war.
__label__de	Singt mit!
__label__de	Tom beachtet mich nie.
__label__de	Sie benimmt sich in letzter Zeit seltsam.
__label__de	Singt leiser!
__label__de	„Jetzt wird’s spannend!“ sagte er, als ich hereinkam.
__label__de	Singt lauter!
__label__de	In den Schuhen habe ich Blasen bekommen.
__label__de	„Wie war dein Stelldichein?“ – „Schrecklich.“
__label__de	„Wie ist dein Stelldichein gelaufen?“ – „Schrecklich.“
__label__de	Bei den Ausbrüchen ist niemand ums Leben gekommen.
__label__de	Tom war von ihrer Schönheit wie betäubt.
__label__de	Er ließ ihr ein Männergewand schneidern, dass sie mit ihm herumreiten könnte.
__label__de	Tom ist nicht der einzige Junge auf der Welt.
__label__de	Du redest vielleicht einen Schmarren!
__label__de	Tom beschloss, die Tatsachen ein bisschen zu verdrehen.
__label__de	Das Essen wurde serviert.
__label__de	Nein, ich habe nicht gewählt.
__label__de	Kürbisse spielen auch in den Halloween-Traditionen eine wichtige Rolle.
__label__de	Tom und Maria begaben sich auf eine Autoreise.
__label__de	Es ist schön, dass wir mehr Zeit miteinander verbringen können.
__label__de	Es ist schön, mehr Zeit miteinander verbringen zu können.
__label__de	Lachen die uns aus?
__label__de	Tom stellt eigenen Wein her.
__label__de	Viele Schüler leiden unter Ängsten.
__label__de	Mama, der tritt mich!
__label__de	Maria trug weiße Tenniskleidung und weiße Tennisschuhe.
__label__de	Das ist moralisch falsch.
__label__de	Er schien gerne Zeit mit ihr zu verbringen.
__label__de	Sie erfreuten sich eines romantischen Abendessens.
__label__de	Du bleibst doch noch zum Tee, oder? Es ist so einsam, ganz allein Tee zu trinken.
__label__de	Tom bekam eine Steuerrückerstattung.
__label__de	Nicht weinen! Es ist doch alles gut!
__label__de	Von Tag zu Tag wurde sie seltsamer und reizbarer, und wir stritten uns unentwegt über Nichtigkeiten.
__label__de	Jetzt heul’ ich aber!
__label__de	Tom fährt ein gelbes Taxi.
__label__de	Wenigstens habe ich von meiner Wohnung aus einen schönen Blick auf die Berge.
__label__de	Feiern können die.
__label__de	Tom machte eine Autoreise durch Europa.
__label__de	Tom spricht Mandarin.
__label__de	Ist sie deine Freundin?
__label__de	Er ging mit Aldrin 2½ Stunden lang auf der Mondoberfläche auf Entdeckungstour.
__label__de	Anna Maria Luisa vererbte die Kunstsammlung der Medici dem toskanischen Staat.
__label__de	Der Fakir legte sich auf ein Nagelbrett.
__label__de	Super Mario Bros. kam vor 30 Jahren heraus.
__label__de	Vor 30 Jahren kam Super Mario Bros. heraus.
__label__de	Ich gebe zu, dass ich schreckliche Angst hatte.
__label__de	„Ach du meine Güte!“ sagte Maria.
__label__de	Die ist hundertpro in Tom verknallt.
__label__de	Maria sah aus, als ginge sie gleich in die Luft.
__label__de	Maria sah wütend aus.

__label__de	Dieses Telefon hat eine Wählscheibe.
__label__de	Ich hasse es, mir Sprachnachrichten anzuhören.
__label__de	Tom und Maria blödeln herum.

__label__de	Heute ist es viel kälter als gestern.
__label__de	Wenn die Monarchie überdauert hätte, dann hätte Deutschland heute statt Bundesländern einzelne Königreiche und statt eines Bundespräsidenten einen Kaiser.

__label__de	Darüber würde ich mir nicht allzu viele Sorgen machen.
__label__de	Vasilissa war die Schönste im ganzen Dorf.
__label__de	Ach, Vassili, was bringt dich denn an diesen verfluchten Ort?
__label__de	Tom fiel durch das Eis in das kalte Wasser.
__label__de	Ich fühle mich eins mit dem Universum.
__label__de	Darüber wollte ich gar nicht mit dir sprechen.
__label__de	Darüber wollte ich gar nicht mit euch sprechen.
__label__de	Darüber wollte ich gar nicht mit Ihnen sprechen.
__label__de	Tom massierte sich mit den Fingerspitzen die Schläfen.
__label__de	Tom fasste Maria am Ellenbogen.

__label__de	„Sag mal, bist du eigentlich nur zum Zuschauen gekommen?“ – „Ich helf’ ja gleich, aber zu so früher Stunde brauche ich mindestens drei Kaffees, um auf Touren zu kommen.“
__label__de	Ich find’s toll, verheiratet zu sein. Man muss sich nur den richtigen Mann aussuchen.
__label__de	Dadurch, dass meine Mutter in der Fremde lebt, ist sie solchen dummen Geschichten aus ihrem Dorf gegenüber sehr aufgeschlossen.
__label__de	Ich träume manchmal, dass ich fliegen kann.
__label__de	Ich lauf’ schnell rüber zum Supermarkt. Soll ich dir etwas mitbringen?
__label__de	Wenn das Leben NEIN zu dir sagt, heißt das nichts anderes, als dass du nur noch nicht am Ziel bist.
__label__de	Langfristig überholt der Fleißige immer das Talent.
__label__de	„Meine Tochter fährt heute nach München.“ – „Hat sie einen Studienplatz gefunden?“ – „Nein, sie will erst ein Praktikum machen.“
__label__de	Erst schaufeln, dann scheffeln.
__label__de	„Jetzt trinken wir erst mal einen.“ – „Aber doch nicht jetzt am Mittag.“ – „Trinken kann man immer.“
__label__de	Deine Eltern können mich einfach nicht leiden. An allem soll ich schuld sein; dabei gebe ich mir solche Mühe.
__label__de	Als mich die Frau Müller fragte, ob ich ein Visum hätte, da habe ich ja gesagt.
__label__de	Es ist schon ein komisches Gefühl, wenn man für immer weggeht und alles zurücklässt, was einem gehört hat.
__label__de	Setzt euch!
__label__de	Die alte Müller ist nicht mehr ganz beieinander.
__label__de	Komm zu mir!
__label__de	Bringt mir das Buch.
__label__de	Wollen Sie nicht über Ihren Kummer sprechen? Vielleicht hilft es.
__label__de	Sie sind sehr freundlich zu mir, aber ich will Sie nicht länger stören. Ich gehe lieber.
__label__de	Kommen Sie! In der Küche können wir ungestört reden.
__label__de	Ich kann ohne eine Aufgabe nicht leben. Ich sitze den ganzen Tag zu Hause und grübele über meine Zukunft nach.
__label__de	Sie dürfen nicht so verzweifelt sein! Lassen Sie den Mut nicht sinken!
__label__de	Im Fernsehen kommt nichts Gescheites, und die Zeitung habe ich auch schon zweimal gelesen. Ich gehe schlafen.

__label__de	Den Optimisten gehört die Welt!
__label__de	Das Leben besteht aus vielen kleinen Münzen, wer sie aufzuheben weiß, hat ein großes Vermögen.
__label__de	Bitte treten Sie ein, gnädige Frau!
__label__de	Vieles ist illegal, was Spaß macht.
__label__de	Nie bekomme ich eine vernünftige Antwort von dir, wenn ich dich was frage!
__label__de	„Hast du Probleme?“ – „Wie kommst du denn darauf?“ – „Ich habe dir beim Telefonieren zugehört.“ – „Aber das tut man doch nicht!“
__label__de	„Willst du noch weg?“ – „Ich muss ganz kurz was erledigen. Ich bin gleich wieder da.“ – „Aber wo willst du denn jetzt noch hin?“
__label__de	Als Maria aufwachte, war Tom verschwunden.
__label__de	Andere haben es auch gesagt.
__label__de	Es ist Mittag und das Gras immer noch nass.
__label__de	Sein Vater ist ein nigerianischer Einwanderer.
__label__de	Arbeitende Menschen verdienen nicht so viel wie Politiker.
__label__de	Geht es Tom schlecht?
__label__de	So war das damals.
__label__de	Wir gehen jeden Sonntag in die Kirche.
__label__de	Der Flughafen ist vierzig Minuten vom Zentrum entfernt.
__label__de	Tom verfiel immer mehr dem Alkohol.
__label__de	Mit Alkohol löst du deine Probleme nicht.
__label__de	Wenn du Hilfe brauchst, bin ich für dich da.

__label__de	Von der Hitze bin ich kaputt.
__label__de	Schweigen hilft uns jetzt nicht.
__label__de	Dann nahm er den Bräutigam beiseite und sagte zu ihm: „Jeder bietet zuerst den besten Wein an und lässt den billigsten übrig, bis die Gäste genug haben, aber den besten hast du dir bisher aufgehoben.“
__label__de	Es gibt kein Europa.
__label__de	Lauter, bitte!
__label__de	Wer möchte das Gedicht aufsagen?
__label__de	Wer möchte den Kinderreim aufsagen?
__label__de	Da wage ich zu widersprechen.
__label__de	Es ist wichtig, dass die Sätze natürlich klingen.
__label__de	Eine gute Ausbildung macht noch keinen guten Menschen, aber ein guter Mensch mit der richtigen Ausbildung kann die Welt für viele Menschen verändern.
__label__de	Der Speisemeister ruft den Bräutigam und spricht zu ihm: Jedermann gibt zum ersten guten Wein und, wenn sie trunken geworden sind, alsdann den geringeren; du hast den guten Wein bisher behalten.
__label__de	Du verstehst mich falsch.
__label__de	Elon Musk erfand Twitter.
__label__de	Ich bin im Pullover eingeschlafen.
__label__de	Sie haben dieselbe Adresse, weil sie zusammen wohnen.
__label__de	Können wir jetzt spielen und danach lernen?

__label__de	Die Glocken läuten. Es ist Mittag.
__label__de	Ich denke, sie ist die wahre Liebe.
__label__de	Wie lange kennst du sie?
__label__de	„Ich denke, ich heirate sie.“ – „Wie lange kennst du sie? Zwei Tage?“
__label__de	Beten wir zusammen!
__label__de	Politiker müssten ihre Heimat mehr lieben als das Geld.
__label__de	Was hast du für eine?
__label__de	In dieser gottlosen Welt verkauft man seine Mutter auch für einen Euro.
__label__de	Es ist schön, einem klugen Menschen zuzuhören.
__label__de	Was essen die Franzosen zum Frühstück?

__label__de	Was essen die Deutschen zum Frühstück?
__label__de	Er sagte, er komme, er ist aber nicht gekommen.
__label__de	Politiker sind die elfte Plage.
__label__de	Draußen ist es neblig.
__label__de	Das habe ich gestern noch gehabt.
__label__de	Ich bekomme nichts mehr runter.
__label__de	Mein Mann arbeitet in einer Bank.
__label__de	Wann öffnen die Banken?
__label__de	Um wie viel Uhr öffnen die Banken?
__label__de	„Wie viele Brüder hast du?“ – „Einen.“
__label__de	Die Bank befindet sich hinter diesem Gebäude.
__label__de	Ich war auf der Beerdigung.
__label__de	Ihr seid alles Lügner!
__label__de	Zu welchem Bezirk gehört diese Nummer?
__label__de	Der Park ist nicht Ihr Eigentum.
__label__de	Der Park ist nicht dein Eigentum.
__label__de	Papa war da nicht zu Hause.
__label__de	Sie ist zu jung, um in Bars zu gehen.
__label__de	Es ist ein warmer Tag.
__label__de	Ich will nichts verlieren.
__label__de	Maria hat Geld, aber keine Freunde.
__label__de	Ich will auf das Konzert gehen.
__label__de	Ich kenne diesen Ort.
__label__de	Das ist bestimmt nicht deins, denn es ist meins.
__label__de	Das ist sicher nicht deins, da es meins ist.
__label__de	Gibt es Hotels auf der Insel?
__label__de	Wenn nichts meinen Willen bestimmt, wird es mir nicht gelingen, zur Tat zu schreiten.
__label__de	Die Friedhöfe liegen außerhalb der Stadt.
__label__de	Was isst man in Russland zum Frühstück?
__label__de	Du musst es ihr sagen.
__label__de	Du musst es ihm sagen.

__label__de	Ich habe hier ein großes Problem.
__label__de	Er hat das Kind unter Einsatz seines Lebens gerettet.
__label__de	Wer kann so spät noch anrufen?
__label__de	Er hat gerade seine Arbeit verloren.
__label__de	Ich weiß nicht einmal, wen ich wählen soll.
__label__de	Ich bin mir nicht sicher, für wen ich stimmen soll.
__label__de	Wieso ist Tom gerade nach Australien gezogen, wenn er nur Französisch und irgendeine Algonkin-Sprache spricht?
__label__de	Ich weiß nicht, wen ich wählen soll.
__label__de	Das tut mir alles in der Seele weh.
__label__de	Wo warst du denn bisher?
__label__de	Wo arbeitest du jetzt?
__label__de	Das Geld erschuf die Welt.

__label__de	Er ist ein überzeugter Republikaner.
__label__de	Was ist die Hauptstadt des Landes?
__label__de	Zu welcher Zeitzone gehört das Land?
__label__de	In dieser verdammten Welt wird alles vom verdammten Geld bestimmt; alles wird von verdammten Banken, von verdammten multinationalen Riesenfirmen, von verdammten Kapitalisten und von verdammten Bankiersfamilien geführt.
__label__de	Sie wird es essen.
__label__de	Dieses kleine Trapez steht für den Boden.
__label__de	Chlorophyll wurde im Jahre 1817 entdeckt.

__label__de	Man muss sich gegenseitig helfen.
__label__de	Jede Frau, die eine Ehe eingeht, fährt mit der Erschaffung des Mannes dort fort, wo Gott aufgehört hat.
__label__de	Eine Frage hätten wir noch!
__label__de	Takt ist, wenn man andere so beschreibt, wie sie sich selbst sehen.
__label__de	Es ist besser zu schweigen und als Idiot verdächtigt zu werden, als zu reden und dadurch alle Zweifel zu beseitigen.
__label__de	Wenn man einmal das Vertrauen seiner Mitbürger verliert, kann man ihre Achtung und ihr Ansehen niemals wiedergewinnen.
__label__de	Ich muss niesen.
__label__de	Wo befindet sich das Land?
__label__de	Nimm deine Farbstifte!
__label__de	Nimm deinen Kuli!
__label__de	Das ist nebulös.
__label__de	Nimm dein Lineal!
__label__de	Nimm deinen Filzstift!
__label__de	Nimm deinen Ordner!
__label__de	Ich kaufe mein Brot immer in der Bäckerei.
__label__de	Das kommt selten so schnell, manchmal auch gar nicht.
__label__de	Doch der Bauer lächelte ihn an.
__label__de	Das ist nicht wahr. Wer hat das gesagt?
__label__de	Vielen Dank für den hilfreichen Vorschlag.

__label__de	So sieht sie es nicht.
__label__de	Tom verließ das Gebäude.
__label__de	Tom kam aus dem Gebäude.
__label__de	Es gefällt mir hier.
__label__de	Mit dir werde ich nicht mal mehr die gleiche Luft atmen!
__label__de	Maria zieht die Männer an wie eine Flamme die Motten.
__label__de	Tom ist im Herzen ein Kind.
__label__de	Tom hat dem Mädchen, mit dem er zusammen war, den Laufpass gegeben.

__label__de	Tom kam mit seiner neuen Stiefmutter nicht aus.
__label__de	Tom hatte zu Weihnachten strahlende Augen wie ein Kind.

__label__de	Er fand sie faszinierend.
__label__de	Tom geriet mit dem Ober in einen Streit.
__label__de	Lucia weinte noch, aber ihre Tränen waren nicht mehr so bitter.
__label__de	Ich habe die Förderung der Gleichstellung der Geschlechter zu einem Schwerpunkt in der Außenpolitik gemacht.

__label__de	„Das müssen Gespenster gewesen sein“, sagte ich.
__label__de	Tom mag Duftkerzen.
__label__de	Lothar Wieler, der Präsident des Robert-Koch-Instituts für Infektionskrankheiten, sagte, die COVID-19-Infektionsraten hätten sich zwar stabilisiert, seien aber noch immer zu hoch.
__label__de	Tom isst gerne Scharfes.
__label__de	Es kostete mehr, als Tom erwartet hatte.
__label__de	Irgendwas ist furchtbar schiefgelaufen.
__label__de	Tom hat nicht die ganze Wahrheit gesagt.
__label__de	In Notzeiten muss die Familie zusammenhalten.
__label__de	„Ich wüsste, wie du auf einen Schlag aus deiner finanziellen Knapplage herauskommst.“ – „Da bin ich aber sehr gespannt!“ – „Heirate mich endlich!“
__label__de	Was in den Zeitungen steht, ist alles Schwindel.
__label__de	Was in den Medien kommt, ist alles Schwindel.
__label__de	Herr Koch, hier sind zwei Herren von der Kriminalpolizei; die möchten Ihnen wegen Ihres Unfalls ein paar Fragen stellen.
__label__de	„Tom ist hier und will mit dir sprechen.“ – „Der soll morgen wiederkommen oder übermorgen oder überhaupt nicht.“
__label__de	Sie hat versucht, ihre Ängste zu beschwichtigen, aber sie hat sie nur noch verstärkt.
__label__de	Warum hat er mich angelogen?
__label__de	Sollte dies Kaffee sein, bringen Sie mir bitte Tee; sollte dies Tee sein, bringen Sie mir bitte Kaffee.
__label__de	Die öffentliche Meinung ist alles. Mit ihr gibt es keine Niederlage, ohne sie keinen Erfolg.
__label__de	Die ganze Familie saß zusammen und bemalte Ostereier.
__label__de	Gott muss die Menschen lieben - sonst hätte er nicht so viele von ihnen gemacht.
__label__de	Eigentum ist eine Frucht von Arbeit. Eigentum ist wünschenswert, ein positives Gut in der Welt. Dass einige reich sind, zeigt, dass andere reich werden können, und das ist wiederum eine Ermutigung für Fleiß und Unternehmensgeist.
__label__de	Er war wütend auf mich, weil ich nicht mehr über ihn wissen wollte.
__label__de	In Takashi verlieben sich reihenweise die Mädchen, vielleicht, weil er so was Geheimnisvolles an sich hat.
__label__de	Gib mir dieses Heft!
__label__de	Er machte beim Vorstellungsgespräch einen sehr guten Eindruck.
__label__de	Das Lächeln wohnt nur auf den Lippen, aber das Lachen hat seinen Sitz und seine Anmut auf den Zähnen.

__label__de	Alle Straßen zur Stadt sind heute gesperrt.
__label__de	Ich kann noch etwa drei Stunden schlafen.
__label__de	Bei Hans kommt man weder mit Strenge noch mit Güte weiter. Er will einfach nicht lernen.
__label__de	Ich muss los; sonst fangen die ohne mich an.
__label__de	Tom hat heute prima gelernt und sich daher eine Belohnung verdient. Ich gehe mit ihm in den Zoo.
__label__de	Was ist mit dir? So sag doch etwas! Soll ich Dr. Müller holen?
__label__de	Als der Notarzt kam, stellten wir entsetzt fest, dass dieser völlig betrunken war.
__label__de	„Hallo, Hans! Ist Anna da?“ – „Ja, komm rein. Die sitzt im Wohnzimmer.“
__label__de	Stell dir vor! Ich habe heute endlich gemacht, was ich dir schon lange versprochen habe.
__label__de	Niemand wird Ihnen helfen können, solange Sie sich nicht eingestehen, dass Sie ein Alkoholiker sind.
__label__de	Wenn du dieses Medikament nimmst, geht es dir bald besser.
__label__de	Warum gefällt Jungen und Mädchen unterschiedliches Spielzeug?
__label__de	Ich habe heute noch nichts vor.
__label__de	Ich verteidige Tom nicht; ich versuche nur, ihn zu verstehen.
__label__de	Freiheit – was ist das schon, wenn sie auf Kosten anderer gelebt wird?
__label__de	„Wollen wir nicht eine Tasse Kaffee trinken?“ – „Nein, vielen Dank. Ich muss gehen.“
__label__de	Jeder einzelne sollte versuchen, in seiner nächsten Umgebung die Welt zu verändern, zum Beispiel einem Freund zu helfen, der in Not ist. Das kann unglaublich viel bewirken.
__label__de	Guten Morgen, Anna! Trinkst du eine Tasse Tee mit uns?
__label__de	Man darf eine Schlacht nie verloren geben, ehe sie begonnen hat.
__label__de	Es ist doch seltsam, dass wir gerade über die Dinge, die uns am meisten beschäftigen, am wenigsten reden.
__label__de	Um Himmels willen! Ich würde mich mit der jungen Astrid nur streiten.
__label__de	Eine Gesellschaft kann nur so sozial sein, wie sie Bildungschancen für jeden ermöglicht.
__label__de	Das ist ungenießbar salzig.
__label__de	Sie ist ins Bett gegangen und gleich eingeschlafen.
__label__de	Danke, dass es dich gibt!
__label__de	Mit meinen paar Brocken Schulfranzösisch bin ich in Paris erstaunlich gut zurechtgekommen.
__label__de	Wie viele Museen gibt es in der Stadt?
__label__de	Reden ist gut; handeln ist besser.
__label__de	Es liegt mir fern, jemanden zu verurteilen.
__label__de	Leider bin ich in der Minderheit.
__label__de	Ich bin in der Minderheit.
__label__de	Leider sind wir in der Minderheit.
__label__de	Wir sind in der Minderheit.
__label__de	Tun Sie’s jetzt, dass Sie’s nicht vergessen!
__label__de	Ich arbeite in einer Halle.
__label__de	Das Brot ist zwei Tage alt.
__label__de	Mit dem Wissen, das er hat, kommt er überall durch.
__label__de	Meine Nachbarin ist nicht so schön wie deine.
__label__de	Was hast du hier geschrieben?
__label__de	Das Gefängnis ist klein.
__label__de	Die meisten Städte haben einen Flughafen.
__label__de	Habe ich wirklich so was gesagt?
__label__de	„Nimm diese Medikamente ein. Diese ...“ – „Lass mich mit diesen Scheissmedikamenten in Ruhe, Mama! Ich bereite mir lieber einen Tee mit Honig zu.“
__label__de	„Warum zitierst du einfache Sätze auch, Tom?“ – „Denkst du, dass ich solche selber erfinden könnte?“ – „Aber natürlich!“
__label__de	Ich kann selber nicht lesen, was ich hier geschrieben habe.
__label__de	Tom hat uns alle beide aus seinem Zimmer geschmissen.
__label__de	Ich werde nicht lange allein sein.
__label__de	Du solltest den anderen Schraubenzieher nehmen.
__label__de	Er ist in Tubiret geboren, und dort ist er auch begraben.
__label__de	Tom sah überrascht auf.
__label__de	Das war eine sehr interessante Entdeckung.
__label__de	Seine Garage ist voll mit gestohlenen Sachen.
__label__de	Du hast das hier gezeichnet?
__label__de	Das geht nur bei bewährten und allseits beliebten Teilnehmern.
__label__de	Ich hatte echt gedacht, dass hätt ich schon hundert mal ausprobiert.
__label__de	Schadenfreude ist Selbstmord für das Karma.
__label__de	Jeder half jedem.
__label__de	Ich denke, ich werde mich nie an koreanisches Essen gewöhnen.
__label__de	Das ist ein großer Schritt zurück.
__label__de	Tom geht vor dem Frühstück gewöhnlich joggen.
__label__de	Die Situation hat sich etwas beruhigt.
__label__de	Nahuatl war die Sprache der Azteken.
__label__de	Tom hat seinen Universitätsabschluss bekommen.
__label__de	Tom sah, dass Maria eifersüchtig war.

__label__de	Diese eineiigen Zwillige wurden bei der Geburt getrennt und 35 Jahre später wieder vereint.
__label__de	Diese Sprache wird mit dem lateinischen Alphabet geschrieben.
__label__de	Man will bei dieser Sprache das kyrillische Alphabet durch das lateinische ersetzen.
__label__de	Tom spricht selten über sich.
__label__de	Wir waren von Anfang an befreundet.
__label__de	Er ist ihr zugetan.
__label__de	Er hat sie gern.
__label__de	Die Kinder werden sehr schnell groß.
__label__de	Sie machte keine Anstalten, sich zu entschuldigen.
__label__de	Ich habe mir neue Handschuhe gekauft.
__label__de	Tom reiste in der Welt umher und ließ mich mit meinen Problemen zu Hause allein.
__label__de	Rechnungen, Rechnungen, nichts als Rechnungen. Wovon ich die bezahlen soll, weiß ich auch nicht.
__label__de	Solche Phänomene interessieren mich brennend.
__label__de	„Ich möchte später auf jeden Fall noch mal ein Kind haben.“ – „Auch ohne Mann?“ – „Lieber keinen Vater als einen schlechten.“
__label__de	Ich will mein Leben nicht für ein Kind umkrempeln, jedenfalls jetzt noch nicht.
__label__de	„Ich brauch’ jetzt unbedingt ein Bier. Hast du mir welches besorgt?“ – „Ach, das habe ich ganz vergessen.“ – „Typisch! In dieser Familie komme ich ja immer zuletzt.“
__label__de	Du musst lernen, dich auch ohne mich zu amüsieren.
__label__de	Würde es dir etwas ausmachen, dich ins Wohnzimmer zu setzen? Ich will hier schnell durchputzen.
__label__de	Jedes tiefere Gespräch ist Anna langweilig.
__label__de	Und da saß der König nun und war ein Schwein. Und wie die Geschichte weitergeht, das erzähle ich euch morgen.
__label__de	Liebe geht durch den Magen, deswegen habe ich abgenommen.
__label__de	Schmerzen zeigen Grenzen, die wir sonst nicht sehen würden.
__label__de	Schmerzen sind Gefühle und Gefühle kann man unterdrücken.
__label__de	Jeder Misthaufen ist das Zentrum der Welt, wenn der richtige Hahn drauf kräht.
__label__de	Die Präsidentschaft ist nicht sein Eigentum.
__label__de	Ich fände es gut, wenn du Vertrauen zu mir hättest.
__label__de	Ich bin so froh, dass du da bist! Ich habe nicht mehr weitergewusst.
__label__de	Bring mir den Kompass.
__label__de	Wer ist vorne?
__label__de	Die Hauptstadt liegt im Süden.
__label__de	Für sein Benehmen gibt es nur eine Erklärung.
__label__de	Als ich ein Kind war, waren nicht so viele Leute allergisch.
__label__de	Die Platte ist wellig.
__label__de	Das Blech ist wellig.
__label__de	Sagen Sie das jeder Frau?
__label__de	Ich habe ihm Arbeit und Unterkunft gegeben.
__label__de	Man hätte es zum doppelten Preis verkaufen können.
__label__de	Wir sind nicht eingeladen.
__label__de	Ich nehme ihr Angebot an.
__label__de	Sie sind ein frecher Kerl!
__label__de	Jedes Wochenende fahren sie nach Hause.
__label__de	Ich habe die Entscheidung getroffen, sein Angebot anzunehmen.
__label__de	„Wo haben Sie die Karte hingetan?“ – „Ich fürchte, junger Mann, die ist ins Feuer gefallen.“
__label__de	Da stinkt was.
__label__de	Was heißt „Ich will nicht“?
__label__de	Ich kann nicht bei euch wohnen.
__label__de	Ich kann nicht bei Ihnen wohnen.
__label__de	Ich kann nicht bei dir wohnen.
__label__de	Dafür gibt es nur eine Erklärung.
__label__de	Sie müssen öfter zu Fuß gehen.
__label__de	Du musst öfter zu Fuß gehen.
__label__de	Ihr müsst öfter zu Fuß gehen.
__label__de	Bemühen Sie sich, öfter zu Fuß zu gehen.
__label__de	Bemüht euch, öfter zu Fuß zu gehen.
__label__de	Bemühe dich, öfter zu Fuß zu gehen.
__label__de	Bemüht euch, mehr zu Fuß zu gehen.
__label__de	Bemühen Sie sich, mehr zu Fuß zu gehen.
__label__de	Bemühe dich, mehr zu Fuß zu gehen.
__label__de	Ich habe den Bus verpasst und musste zu Fuß hierherkommen.
__label__de	Er hat beschlossen, noch mal bei Null anzufangen.
__label__de	Hast du schon mal Frauen gesehen, die einen armen Schlucker liebgehabt hätten?
__label__de	Ich kann jetzt nicht mit Ihnen sprechen.
__label__de	Ich kann jetzt nicht mit euch sprechen.
__label__de	Ich kann jetzt nicht mit dir sprechen.
__label__de	Das ist ein sehr mutiger Schritt.
__label__de	Das ist sehr mutig.
__label__de	Das ist sehr mutig von dir.
__label__de	Das ist sehr mutig von Ihnen.
__label__de	Das ist sehr mutig von euch.

__label__de	Am liebsten hat Tom Bilder, auf denen seine Familienmitglieder und Freunde zu sehen sind.
__label__de	Warum hat mir niemand davon erzählt?
__label__de	Ich hätte Professor Müller gerne noch einmal wiedergesehen.
__label__de	Lächle und freue dich!
__label__de	Warum machst du dir seinetwegen solche Sorgen?
__label__de	Der Schlüssel ist das Symbol des Hl. Petrus.
__label__de	Die Ingenieure haben die ganze Nacht durchgearbeitet.
__label__de	Sprechen wir doch jetzt darüber!

__label__de	Ich konnte nicht anders: ich musste sie necken.

__label__de	Mit uns wollte ich auch nicht zu tun haben, wenn ich ein Außerirdischer wäre.
__label__de	Ich höre mich gern reden - es ist so unterhaltend, sich zuzuhören.

__label__de	Tom hat in Tibet Französisch gelernt.

__label__de	Ich muss öfter zu Fuß gehen.
__label__de	Wenn du jetzt gehst, dann brauchst du nicht mehr wiederzukommen!
__label__de	Als Tom aus dem Tankstellenhäuschen kam, war sein Wagen weg. Er hatte nämlich den Schlüssel steckenlassen, und Maria hatte sich kurzerhand auf die Fahrerseite gesetzt und war weggefahren.
__label__de	Das ist das erste, woran ich denke, wenn ich diesen Satz höre.
__label__de	Er ist reich, obgleich er nicht arbeitet.

__label__de	Wegen der Kinder haben wir das Auto gewechselt.

__label__de	Es ruft keine Erhabenheit hervor, wenn die Armseligkeit die Erbärmlichkeit tadelt.
__label__de	Feministinnen werden wohl nie begreifen das die eigentliche Frau viel mächtiger und bezaubernder im Weltgeschehen wirkt, als es je die feministischen Aktivitäten getan haben.
__label__de	Ich sah selten Dummheit im wirklich Bösen, dafür aber sehr oft im Guten, das macht das Böse so gefährlich.
__label__de	Je sinnloser ein Krieg, desto sinnvoller wird der Kampf gegen ihn werden.
__label__de	Tom ist erblich belastet.

__label__de	Arbeit ist immer genug da.

__label__de	Ist dies ein guter Satz?
__label__de	Ist das ein guter Satz?
__label__de	Sie hat vergessen, was sie schreiben wollte.
__label__de	Was erwarten die von ihm?
__label__de	Sie hat vergessen, was sie sagen wollte.
__label__de	Vor morgen entlassen die mich nicht.
__label__de	Ich werde nicht entlassen, bevor ich geheilt bin.
__label__de	Tolle Neuigkeiten! Heute ist mein Vater endlich aus dem Krankenhaus entlassen worden.
__label__de	Er wurde eine Woche nach der Operation entlassen.
__label__de	Ich bin heute aus dem Krankenhaus entlassen worden.
__label__de	Wie schaffen Sie es, Optimist zu bleiben?

__label__de	Darüber macht man keine Witze.
__label__de	Damit macht man keine Witze.
__label__de	Kennst du den Jungen auf dieser Photographie?
__label__de	Ich gehe mal nachsehen, was die da machen.
__label__de	Draußen harkt jemand Laub.
__label__de	Ich habe dieses Jahr noch gar keine Laubbläser gehört. Sind die wegen der erheblichen Lärmbelästigung inzwischen verboten worden?
__label__de	Es ist Herbst, aber ich habe noch keinen einzigen Laubbläser gehört. Was ist da los?
__label__de	„Das ist kein Laubbläser, sondern ein Laubsauger.“ – „Das ist mir egal! Ich will, dass endlich Ruhe ist!“
__label__de	Jetzt ist Schluss mit lustig! Was zuviel ist, ist zuviel!
__label__de	Ein Rentner kam an den Gartenzaun und beschwerte sich bei seinem Nachbarn über den Lärm, den dieser mit seinem Laubbläser machte. Der Nachbar richtete das Gerät dann kurzerhand auf den Rentner und blies ihm das Gebiss aus dem Mund. Die Situation eskalierte.

__label__de	Warum trägt er Schwarz?
__label__de	Das ist so klein, dass ich es kaum sehe!

__label__de	Ich habe den Kindern zwei Schokonikoläuse gekauft.
__label__de	Warum spricht niemand darüber, wer für die Zerstörung verantwortlich ist?
__label__de	Warum ist eine Körpererweiterung vom Grade 2 stets normal?
__label__de	Diese Sachen werden in Mainstream-Medien verschwiegen.
__label__de	Man muss vorsichtig sein, was man sagt. Wenn man nicht dem Mainstream folgt, kann man ganz schnell geächtet sein.
__label__de	Die Frage ist nur, ob du arbeiten oder Geld verdienen willst.
__label__de	Wann ist in Russland Weihnachten?
__label__de	Ich habe nie Bargeld dabei.
__label__de	Tom hat einen sehr dicken Bauch.
__label__de	Man darf ihnen nicht glauben.
__label__de	Zwischen Peter und Anna bahnt sich etwas an.

__label__de	„Ich gehöre wenigstens irgendwohin.“ – „Mama, das ist eine Sekte!“
__label__de	Pack deine Sachen und hau ab!
__label__de	Bist du absichtlich so blöd?
__label__de	Wir wollen nicht hineigehen.
__label__de	Ich lebe im Nordosten von Brasilien.

__label__de	Du hast einen Kopf, um zu denken.
__label__de	Wenn du klug bist, kannst du dieses Geld binnen einer Woche verdienen.
__label__de	Toms Bauch schaut unter dem T-Shirt heraus.
__label__de	Ich schreibe einfach, was mir einfällt.
__label__de	Denk nicht zu lange nach, sonst verkaufe ich es einem anderen!

__label__de	Der Schlüssel ist unter dem Blumentopf mit Aloe Vera.
__label__de	Jemand wurde getötet, aber der Leichnam ist beseitigt worden.
__label__de	Kommt ihr nicht herein?
__label__de	Schau, wie groß der Ficus, den ich von dir bekam, geworden ist!
__label__de	Willst du viel Geld verdienen?
__label__de	Willst du dir ein bisschen was dazuverdienen? Dann sperr mal die Lauscher auf!
__label__de	„Er starb als Held.“ – „Er ist gestorben.“
__label__de	Das Elend dieser Welt abzubilden ist nicht genug. Man muss sich auch bemühen, einen Ausweg zu finden.
__label__de	„Ihr Sohn starb als Held, Frau Müller.“ – „Ich weiß nur, dass mein Sohn gestorben ist.“
__label__de	Schau dir das an! Ich habe das Gefühl, man bekommt immer weniger Erdbeeren für immer mehr Geld.
__label__de	Die Krabben müssen in den Kühlschrank.
__label__de	Welche Aufgaben erfüllt ein Nachlassverwalter?
__label__de	„Tom, der Herr ist von der Kripo.“ – „O hallo, Derrick! Wurde jemand umgebracht?“
__label__de	Ich habe keinen Augenblick gezögert.
__label__de	Maria weint schnell.
__label__de	Im deutschen Leipzig sind aus einem Zoo zwei Löwen entkommen.
__label__de	Die Variante B117 des Coronavirus ist bereits in Kalifornien, Colorado und Florida sowie 30 anderen Ländern entdeckt worden.

__label__de	Der Zug fährt vom Bahnhof ab.
__label__de	Es war sonderbar, inmitten so vieler trauriger und erschöpfter Gesichter eines zu sehen, das voller Kraft und Entschlossenheit war. Dieser Anblick glich mir einem Feuer in einem Schneesturm.
__label__de	Maria brachte den Tee und die Kuchen herein.
__label__de	Ich habe es Maria gegenüber mit keinem Wort erwähnt, denn ich wusste, dass es sie bekümmern würde.
__label__de	Keine Sorge! Früher oder später kommt sie zur Besinnung.
__label__de	Maria hat für alle gekocht.
__label__de	Tom will reisen und Menschen aus aller Welt kennenlernen.
__label__de	Woher wusste sie, wo sie mich fände?
__label__de	Tom und Maria lasen zusammen ein Buch.
__label__de	Tom und Maria haben zusammen ein Buch gelesen.
__label__de	Tom und Maria wanderten auf den Vulkan.
__label__de	Wie komme ich in den Westteil der Stadt?
__label__de	Er antwortet mit "Ja".
__label__de	Viele halten Latein für eine tote Sprache.
__label__de	Er kam zu dem Treffen gerannt.
__label__de	Ich singe beim Baden.
__label__de	Ich sitze und betrachte das schöne Bild an der Wand.
__label__de	Der Hund steht neben dem Tisch und betrachtet das Essen.
__label__de	Dieser Fluss mündet in den Pazifischen Ozean.
__label__de	Die Teetasse war fast durchsichtig.
__label__de	Ich hoffe sehr, ich habe dich mit meiner Geschichte nicht gelangweilt.
__label__de	Zu seinen Kunden zählen auch renommierte Restaurants in der Stadt New York.
__label__de	Tom wusste nichts von Marias Plänen.
__label__de	Die Kinder sind zum Erntedankfest alle nach Hause gekommen.
__label__de	An der Rettungsaktion waren über 240 Polizei- und Rettungskräfte beteiligt.
__label__de	„Ach, ich bin überglücklich!“ rief er der kleinen Meerjungfrau zu.
__label__de	Anne warf sich Marilla in die Arme und küsste ihr vor Begeisterung die fahlen Wangen.
__label__de	Tom ist zur Geheimhaltung verpflichtet.
__label__de	Tränen strömten ihr aus den Augen.
__label__de	Damals waren wir zusammen.
__label__de	Maria hat zum erstenmal einen Jungen geküsst.
__label__de	„Tom macht Frühstück.“ – „Müssen wir die Feuerwehr holen?“
__label__de	Er kam zu Fuß hierher.
__label__de	Indem Sie fragen, gelangen Sie in die Stadt.
__label__de	Seine Sätze werden viel gelesen, aber wenig übersetzt.
__label__de	Ich werde nur drei Minuten warten.
__label__de	Mir reicht’s mit deinem Gejammere!
__label__de	Ich denke, dass Tom ein guter Nachbar ist.
__label__de	Sie starrte ihn zornig an.
__label__de	Die hat Mut, oder?
__label__de	Wie lernt man eine Sprache am besten?
__label__de	Sie werden sie nicht entkommen lassen.
__label__de	Städte sind die Schmelztiegel der Zivilisation.
__label__de	Sie antwortete uns auf Englisch.
__label__de	Die Sicherheit in der Unsicherheit zu finden – das fördert die Kreativität.
__label__de	Kunst ist nicht der Anspruch auf Perfektion.
__label__de	Zu siegen verstehst du, Hannibal, aber den Sieg zu nutzen verstehst du nicht.
__label__de	Im Aufschub verbirgt sich Gefahr.
__label__de	Annas Vater ist der Bruder meiner Großmutter väterlicherseits. Somit ist sie meine Tante zweiten Grades.
__label__de	Ich würde gerne kommen, aber ich habe keine Zeit.
__label__de	Ich weiß nicht. Fragen Sie einen anderen.
__label__de	Ich hörte Opa draußen die Auffahrt fegen und ging hin, um ihm zu helfen.
__label__de	Die werden sie nicht entkommen lassen.
__label__de	Ich glaube, heute gibt es Regen.
__label__de	Wir sollten mehr Tee und weniger Kaffee trinken.
__label__de	Ich habe die Kameraaufnahme selber gesehen; du bist eindeutig darauf.
__label__de	Die Bordkamera hat den Unfall aufgenommen.
__label__de	An seiner Erzählung stimmt etwas nicht.
__label__de	Koch du morgen!
__label__de	Ihr Ex-Freund wollte mich erstechen.
__label__de	Man wird den Unterschied nicht wahrnehmen.
__label__de	Stellt euch hinter mich!
__label__de	Stellt euch hinter mich! Er hat ein Messer.
__label__de	Das Wohnzimmer ist schön hell, aber die Küche ist ziemlich dunkel.
__label__de	Die Fenster blicken nach Süden.
__label__de	Wir können gleich gehen.
__label__de	Sie übt vor dem Spiegel.
__label__de	Als ich im Garten spazieren ging, fand ich eine Schildkröte.
__label__de	Neugriechisch ist einfacher als Esperanto.
__label__de	Endlich haben wir eine Aufgabe.
__label__de	Als ich zu meinem Haus ging, traf ich sie.
__label__de	Warum helfen Sie nie?
__label__de	Warum hilfst du nie?
__label__de	Warum helft ihr nie?
__label__de	Der kleine Junge war Tangos einziger Freund.
__label__de	Sami war ein exzellenter Schütze.
__label__de	Ich war in Australien, als es passiert ist.
__label__de	Die Feuerwehr arbeitet in der Hoffnung zu helfen.
__label__de	Du wirst das machen, ob du willst oder nicht.
__label__de	Sie werden das machen, ob Sie wollen oder nicht.
__label__de	Ihr werdet das machen, ob ihr wollt oder nicht.
__label__de	Algier ist die Hauptstadt von Algerien.
__label__de	Chinesisch ist um einiges schwieriger als andere Fremdsprachen.
__label__de	Wenn ich dich sehe, erinnere ich mich an deinen Vater.
__label__de	Ich will auch endlich Auto fahren lernen.
__label__de	Ruby bat mich, ihr Hände zu fühlen, und sie waren eiskalt.
__label__de	Tom ist ein sehr attraktiver und intelligenter Mann.
__label__de	Tom fiel die Eiswaffel in den Sand.
__label__de	Tom ist die Eiswaffel in den Sand gefallen.
__label__de	Toms Eltern waren sehr streng.
__label__de	Tom hatte sehr strenge Eltern.
__label__de	Alle lieben und verehren die Königin.
__label__de	Warum bist du immer so ernst?
__label__de	Warum seid ihr immer so ernst?
__label__de	Warum sind Sie immer so ernst?
__label__de	Was bist du immer so ernst?
__label__de	Warum war er so verärgert?
__label__de	Die Forscher fanden heraus, dass Witze mit Gelächter als durchschnittlich um 15 % lustiger bewertet wurden als solche ohne.
__label__de	Tom ist ein Zauberer, und Maria ist eine Hexe.
__label__de	Seid ihr zufrieden?
__label__de	Alle Wesen sind schön.
__label__de	Wir waren dort anwesend.
__label__de	Ich fühle mich gut dabei, etwas Gutes zu tun.
__label__de	Meine Hunde verbringen ihren Tag damit, im Garten zu spielen und zu rennen.
__label__de	Von welcher Fußballmannschaft sind Sie ein Fan?
__label__de	Wir denken anders, wenn wir mit kleinen Kindern sprechen.
__label__de	Sie schreibt einen Artikel für die Schülerzeitung.
__label__de	Er hat es mir auf Latein geschrieben.
__label__de	Der richtige Moment lässt viele Dinge im Leben ganz einfach erscheinen.
__label__de	Der kluge Ehemann kauft seiner Frau nur das teuerste Porzellan, weil er dann sicher sein darf, dass sie es nicht nach ihm wirft.
__label__de	Vielleicht haben die Leute recht, die da sagen, ich hätte eine zu schwache linke Hand. Aber es ist schließlich meine rechte, mit der ich die Schecks in Empfang nehme.
__label__de	Man könnte sagen, das ist ein kleiner Schritt für ein Proton, aber ein großer Sprung für die Menschheit.
__label__de	„Wer suchet, der findet“, sagte der Weise.
__label__de	Die Strompreise sind gestiegen.
__label__de	„Hanna!“ – „Lea!“ – „Wie ich leibe und lebe! Du bist wieder da!“ – „Jawohl!“ – „Zum Henker noch mal! Wie geht’s dir?“ – „Gleich viel besser, wo ich dich sehe. Hast du Zeit für ein Bierchen? Wir haben uns ja einiges zu erzählen.“
__label__de	Es ist gleich die Straße runter.
__label__de	Bei den Nachbarn bewegten sich die Vorhänge.
__label__de	Ich kann einen Handstand machen.
__label__de	Ich muss mich verlesen haben.
__label__de	Dieser Tee ist heiß.
__label__de	Dieser schwarze Tee ist heiß.
__label__de	Die wohnen in einer Blockhütte.
__label__de	Er wartete am Bahnhof auf sie.
__label__de	Ich werde mich auf mein Zimmer begeben.
__label__de	Das ist ein Witz nur zwischen ihm und mir.
__label__de	„Du hast die Socken auf links.“ – „Ach, na ja, was soll’s!“
__label__de	Wie bist du in meine Wohnung gekommen?
__label__de	Wie sind Sie in meine Wohnung gekommen?
__label__de	Wie seid ihr in meine Wohnung gekommen?
__label__de	Kannst du irgendwohin?
__label__de	Tom zerkrümelte Kekse und verrührte sie mit dem Quark.
__label__de	Das ist dein Zug.
__label__de	Das ist euer Zug.
__label__de	Das ist Ihr Zug.
__label__de	„Wie möchtest du deinen Tee?“ – „Mit Milch, aber ohne Zucker.“
__label__de	„Wie möchten Sie Ihren Tee?“ – „Mit Milch, aber ohne Zucker.“
__label__de	Die Schüler taten so, als hörten sie die Lehrerin nicht.
__label__de	Er muss seinen Lebenslauf noch einmal neu schreiben.
__label__de	„Kennst du wen in Bristol?“ – „Nö. Wieso?“ – „Ein Kumpel hat mir Eintrittskarten für ein Konzert am Wochenende dort gegeben, und da hab’ ich so überlegt, ob ich die Nacht nicht bei wem auf dem Boden pennen könnte.“
__label__de	Sie brachte ihm verschiedene Knoten bei.
__label__de	Das ist auf Englisch geschrieben.
__label__de	Tom hat dort niemanden gesehen.
__label__de	Kannst du’s mir verdenken, wenn ich dir nicht traue?
__label__de	Könnt ihr’s mir verdenken, wenn ich euch nicht traue?
__label__de	Können Sie’s mir verdenken, wenn ich Ihnen nicht traue?
__label__de	Wir machen eine kleine Pause.
__label__de	Es müssen im ganzen Land noch viel mehr Ladestationen für E-Fahrzeuge installiert werden.
__label__de	Mein Kaffee ist stärker als der von Johannes.
__label__de	Gefällt dir die Hose, die ich gerade gekauft habe?
__label__de	Gefällt euch die Hose, die ich gerade gekauft habe?
__label__de	Gefällt Ihnen die Hose, die ich gerade gekauft habe?
__label__de	Sie warf ihren trinkenden Ehemann aus dem Haus.
__label__de	Langsam wird’s unheimlich.
__label__de	Sie ist im zweiten Studienjahr.
__label__de	Sie wurde zur Bürgermeisterin gewählt.
__label__de	Die javanischen Steinriesen fressen Felsen und trinken flüssige Lava.
__label__de	Göttlich ist die Klarheit deiner Augen, die durchsichtig sind wie Kristalltropfen.
__label__de	Ich mag es doch auch; es ist nur teuer.
__label__de	Ich will nicht zu lange bleiben.
__label__de	Er hat sich in den Laubhaufen gelegt.
__label__de	Maria ist eine virtuose Flötistin.
__label__de	Sie hat sich in mein Bett gelegt.
__label__de	Maria ist eine meisterhafte Flötenspielerin.
__label__de	Er hat am Sonntag mit seinem Sohn eine Hundehütte gebaut.
__label__de	Ich weiß, dass Sie auch Kinder haben.
__label__de	Sie müssen mich verstehen.
__label__de	Sie hat den Katzen, die im Garten an ihre Blumen pinkeln, den Krieg erklärt.
__label__de	Ihm gelang im letzten Moment die Flucht.
__label__de	Ihr Vater besaß einst ein Ruderboot.
__label__de	Kannst du bei Verwandten oder Freunden unterkommen?
__label__de	Wir haben zu zweit das Auto geschoben.
__label__de	Du fährst in die entgegengesetzte Richtung.
__label__de	Die Fischerboote verließen den Hafen.
__label__de	Tom ging Schmalzkringel kaufen.
__label__de	Ich habe gestohlen, damit meine Kinder etwas zu essen haben.
__label__de	O Gott, der hat den anderen Laster zehn Minuten lang überholt!
__label__de	Er hat die Blätter zu einem Haufen zusammengekehrt.
__label__de	Halte dich von den Klippen fern!
__label__de	Haltet euch von den Klippen fern!
__label__de	Halten Sie sich von den Klippen fern!
__label__de	Omas Speisekammer ist bis zum Rand gefüllt.
__label__de	Er hat durchaus gut Englisch gelernt, während er, Bier trinkend, auf dem Sofa lag.
__label__de	Heute Nachmittag will ich zur Apotheke und einen Coronatest machen lassen.
__label__de	„Tom, Tom, Tom und Tom. Immer nur Tom. Du hast doch auch einen anderen Sohn, nicht wahr?“ – „Meinst du Ziri?“
__label__de	Zīrī ibn Manād war der Begründer der Berberdynastie der Ziriden im Maghreb. Er lebte im 10. Jahrhundert.
__label__de	Die „Ziriden“, die sich auf Zīrī berufen, gibt es noch heute.
__label__de	Tom reiste in den Maghreb und lernte dort Zīrī, einen Berberführer, kennen.
__label__de	Ich habe viel gesehen, als ich dort war.
__label__de	Mit wem bist du einkaufen gegangen?
__label__de	Ich habe vieles gesehen, während ich dort war.
__label__de	Ein Polizist rutschte auf feuchten Blättern aus. In den Medien wurde ein Hundehaufen daraus.
__label__de	Zīrī fuhr durch einen Wald.
__label__de	Nachdem Bernd die Blätter mit dem Rechen zusammengeharkt hatte, kam sein Sohn Sören und wirbelte sie mit dem Laubbläser wieder auseinander.
__label__de	Hänsel und Gretel fuhren mit dem Motorrad durch den Wald; da hörten sie Diskomusik, die kam aus einer Hütte.
__label__de	Die Demokratie stammt aus Griechenland.
__label__de	Ziri hat etwas Werbung bekommen.
__label__de	Ich wärme meine Hände in den Hosentaschen.
__label__de	Ziri Ziri hat in den Billboard Hot 100 Tom Jackson überholt.
__label__de	Matthew McConaughey wird im Film „Tom Jackson“ Ziris Rolle spielen.
__label__de	Die Diagnose der Ärzte kam einem Todesurteil gleich.
__label__de	Aus Rücksicht auf Tom trinken wir auf unseren Familienfeiern nichts Alkoholisches.
__label__de	„Wann hat Tom eigentlich mit der Trinkerei angefangen?“ – „Da muss er Anfang 20 gewesen sein. Es ging bei ihm schon früh los.“
__label__de	„Oje, so viele Flaschen, und das bei unserer Ute!“ klagte Mutter Anna, als sie Pauls Barfach im Wohnzimmerschrank sah. Dazu muss man wissen, dass Ute ein Alkoholproblem hatte.
__label__de	Tom war furchtbar unglücklich, denn alle hatten Angst, sich bei ihm anzustecken, und behandelten ihn daher wie einen Aussätzigen.
__label__de	Tom wurde als Ungeimpfter wie ein Aussätziger behandelt und vom sozialen Geschehen ausgeschlossen.
__label__de	Tom hatte fest damit gerechnet, dass sich Maria freuen würde, dass er wieder da wäre, aber sie bereitete ihm keinen freudigen Empfang und half ihm auch nicht, seine Sachen auszupacken. Keine Überraschung wartete auf ihn, und nicht einmal vom Bahnhof hatte sie ihn abgeholt. Tom war sehr enttäuscht.
__label__de	Maria verwendet das Internet nur, um sich Katzenvideos anzuschauen und zu chatten.
__label__de	Es wartete eine Überraschung auf mich, aber keine freudige.
__label__de	Dieses Haus ist väterliches Erbgut.
__label__de	Tom ist so einfältig, dass er alles glaubt, was man ihm sagt.
__label__de	Wenn du nicht kommst, bleibst du hier.
__label__de	Als Tom die eheliche Wohnung betrat, war alles dunkel. Er ging leise ins Schlafzimmer, wo er Maria wähnte, und wollte das geliebte Wesen sanft wecken, aber im Bett lag ein Mann!
__label__de	Ich verstehe nicht, warum diese Menschen so widerlich zueinander sind.
__label__de	Ehe – das bedeutet miteinander und füreinander.
__label__de	Schicke Schale, fauler Kern – das ist Anna.
__label__de	Ich werde heute eine gemütliche Teestunde mit meiner Tochter Anna verbringen.
__label__de	„Brauchen wir Gläser?“ – „Aber natürlich brauchen wir Gläser. Oder sind wir etwa Affen?“ – „Wieso? Trinken Affen aus der Flasche?“
__label__de	Ich komme mir hier total überflüssig vor.
__label__de	Hier herrscht so eine gereizte Stimmung. Ich glaub’, ich zieh’ aus.
__label__de	Tom hat gesagt, er wolle nie wieder einen Fuß in dieses Haus setzen.
__label__de	Ich glaube, er will alles verdrängen, was je zwischen uns war.
__label__de	Er hat viel Geld, aber will nichts davon abgeben.
__label__de	Tom hat im Schlaf den Namen einer anderen Frau ausgesprochen.
__label__de	Das war von vornherein abgesprochen.
__label__de	„Scheint draußen noch die Sonne?“ – „Nein, es ist inzwischen wieder bewölkt.“ – „Schade. Ich wollte doch gern im Sonnenschein spazierengehen.“ – „Tja, da musst du nächstesmal eben spontaner sein.“
__label__de	Die Sonne scheint nicht mehr. Es ist wieder bewölkt und sieht sogar nach Regen aus.
__label__de	Da ziehen aber dunkle Wolken auf! Wir gehen wohl besser zum Auto zurück.
__label__de	Noch scheint die Sonne, aber es soll heute ein Unwetter kommen.
__label__de	„Ich möchte, dass du zu mir zurückkommst, und zwar heute noch!“ – „Das kannst du vergessen! Es ist aus – ein für allemal! Verstehe das endlich!“
__label__de	Bitte komm zu mir zurück!
__label__de	Ich werde dich nie vergessen, Liebe meines Lebens!
__label__de	Du machst immer Anspielungen, die ich nicht verstehe.
__label__de	Ich weiß, dass du mein bitteres Lied hören wirst, dieses Seufzen eines gequälten Herzens.
__label__de	Ich geh gleich los zum Doktor.
__label__de	Magie ist eine Illusion.
__label__de	Das ist auf keinen Fall was ich erwartet habe.
__label__de	Ich falle aufgrund meiner lila Haare und Nasenpiercings in einem vollen Raum eher mehr auf.
__label__de	Spielst du jeden Tag Fussball?
__label__de	Die Affen springen von Zweig zu Zweig.
__label__de	Sitz nicht ungemütlich in der Ecke um ein Buch zu lesen. Nimm dir einen Stuhl und setzt dich hier hin.
__label__de	Vielleicht wurde Tom falsch verstanden.
__label__de	Ich hoffe er hat unrecht.
__label__de	Tom ist in Australien herumgereist.
__label__de	Das kann man nicht ergoogeln.
__label__de	Das ist etwas, das ich nicht brauche.
__label__de	Versprich mir, daß du ihr hilfst.
__label__de	Es wurde auch Zeit, daß wir das gemacht haben.
__label__de	Je weniger Tom und Mary wissen, desto besser.
__label__de	Tom und Mary drücken sich sehr gut aus.
__label__de	Algerien sollte keine privaten Geschäfte verstaatlichen.
__label__de	Das ist nicht das, was ich gemacht habe.
__label__de	Ich mach sowas nicht oft.
__label__de	Dein Haus ist sehr schön.
__label__de	Was kostet das Brot?
__label__de	Sag Tom ich weiss warum er es getan hat.
__label__de	Was würde ich danach machen?
__label__de	Pomelo und Grapefruit sind sehr ähnlich.
__label__de	Ich hab dir gesagt daß Tom nach Australien gehen wollte.
__label__de	Wenn Tom Schwimmen geht, gehe ich auch Schwimmen.
__label__de	Tom sagt Mary scheinte nicht glücklich zu sein.
__label__de	Tom mag auch Schwimmen.
__label__de	Sami hat sechs verschiedene Kreditkarten.
__label__de	Ich versprach mich nicht zu verspäten.
__label__de	Tom hat mich mehrere Fragen gefragt.
__label__de	Sorg dich da ma nicht um.
__label__de	Tom gab seine Arbeit auf, um Alpacas zu züchten.
__label__de	Oft ist der Gesang ein reines Weinen.
__label__de	Warte, ich muss mich jetzt setzten bevor ich gleich umfalle.
__label__de	Das würde ich jetzt nicht als tragisch ansehen.
__label__de	Es scheint genug Platz zu geben.
__label__de	Ich gebe zu, dass ich neugierig bin.
__label__de	Es fiel vom Tisch, aber es zerbrach nicht.
__label__de	Schaut ihren Töchtern nicht in die Augen.
__label__de	In den Knochenkammern befinden sich noch heute die Gebeine Tausender Toter aus der Zeit der Türkenbelagerung.
__label__de	Schauen Sie ihren Töchtern nicht in die Augen.
__label__de	Die Wiener wollten sich lieber unter Ruinen begraben lassen als kapitulieren.
__label__de	Ich weiß jetzt endlich, wie die Franzosen Baguette essen.
__label__de	Leider war das Telefon kaputt.
__label__de	Die Eule hat die schönsten Küken im Wald.
__label__de	Geben Sie mir Wasser zu trinken.
__label__de	Gebt mir Wasser zu trinken.
__label__de	Gib mir Wasser zu trinken.
__label__de	Wer die Sprache Tamazight liebt, muss sie schreiben lernen.
__label__de	Ja, natürlich. Sie haben recht.
__label__de	Ja, natürlich. Ihr habt recht.
__label__de	Ja, natürlich. Du hast recht.
__label__de	Ich kenne viele Leute, die kein Fleisch essen.
__label__de	Mach nicht aus allem eine Tragödie!
__label__de	Was könnten wir tun, um euch zu helfen?
__label__de	Wie könnten wir euch helfen?
__label__de	Er veröffentlicht einen regierungsfeindlichen Artikel.
__label__de	Nachbarn haben gesehen, wie Tom mitten in der Nacht von zwei Männern abgeholt wurde. Seitdem ist er spurlos verschwunden.
__label__de	Das ist ein Standpunkt, der verteidigt wird.
__label__de	Daher dürfte jetzt alles passen.
__label__de	Ich wollte sie nicht mehr wiedersehen.
__label__de	Das Zitat regte eine Diskussion an.
__label__de	Sie sagte: „Mein Garten ist wunderschön.“
__label__de	Es lebe das Brautpaar!
__label__de	Maria hörte Tom ihren Namen rufen.
__label__de	Tom und Johannes hatten vergessen, dem Gott des Meeres ein Opfer darzubringen, und entkamen mit knapper Not dem Schicksal, von einem Seeungeheuer gefressen zu werden.
__label__de	Ich mache mir Sorgen um dich. Irgendwie organisierst du dein Leben falsch.
__label__de	Wenn du nicht schlafen kannst, kann ich auch nicht schlafen.
__label__de	Merkst du denn nicht, dass du dich von deiner Arbeit auffressen lässt? Früher hast du nie so viele Überstunden gemacht und nicht diese grässlichen Akten mit nach Hause gebracht.
__label__de	„Gehen wir doch heute Abend zu der Feier bei Smirnows! Es wird dir guttun, mal unter Leute zu kommen.“ – „Wenn du wüsstest, was bei mir im Büro los ist! Ich möchte viel lieber einen Abend mal richtig früh ins Bett gehen.“
__label__de	Wenn du mitkommst, mache ich mich besonders schön für dich!
__label__de	Du hältst mich wohl für blöd, was?
__label__de	Schön, dass Sie da sind! Ich hatte gehofft, dass Sie kommen würden.
__label__de	Tom ist so naiv, dass er alles glaubt, was man ihm sagt.
__label__de	Maria bekam zufällig das Liebesgesäusel zwischen ihrem Ehemann und der neuen Nachbarin mit.
__label__de	„Heiß hier drin, was?“ – „In der Hölle ist’s heißer.“
__label__de	Maria ging auf die Straße in der Hoffnung, Tom dort zu begegnen.
__label__de	Wir haben Vollmond. Ich werde bestimmt nicht schlafen können.
__label__de	Soll ich dir den Nacken massieren?
__label__de	„Wo willst du denn jetzt noch hin?“ – „Nur einmal um den Block ein bisschen frische Luft schnappen. Ich bin gleich wieder da.“ – „Soll ich mitkommen?“
__label__de	Die Supernova leuchtete so hell, dass sie auf der Erde einen Schatten warf.
__label__de	Peter fuhr nachts mit dem Fahrrad die Straße entlang und sah seinen Vater in einem Hauseingang umschlungen mit der jungen Nachbarin stehen, wie sie sich gerade küssten.
__label__de	Geraten Sie nicht in Panik! Das hilft Ihnen nicht und Ihrem Mann erst recht nicht.
__label__de	Er spricht nie über seine Kinder.
__label__de	Warum habt ihr nicht die Wahrheit gesagt?
__label__de	Warum hast du nicht die Wahrheit gesagt?
__label__de	Ich rate dir, den Mund zu halten.
__label__de	Tom ist dir ähnlich.
__label__de	Aber ich verstehe das nicht ganz.
__label__de	Aber ich verstehe ihn nicht ganz.
__label__de	Ich liebe alle meine Tanten.
__label__de	Ich sehe die Frau in Schwarz.
__label__de	Ich sehe die in Schwarz gekleidete Frau.
__label__de	Warum hast du nicht geschlafen?
__label__de	Wer kannte ihren Sohn?
__label__de	Er hat nichts gefragt.
__label__de	Sie müssen sich eine Beschäftigung suchen.
__label__de	Sie müssen eine Beschäftigung finden.
__label__de	Ich habe getrunken, glaubend, dass ich dich dann vergäße.
__label__de	Er singt falsch.
__label__de	Frag die, die’s wissen!
__label__de	Fragt die, die’s wissen!
__label__de	Fragen Sie die, die’s wissen!
__label__de	Das ist alles, was von der alten Festungsmauer übriggeblieben ist.
__label__de	Wer braucht diesen Krempel?
__label__de	Du zäumst das Pferd wie immer von hinten auf.
__label__de	Mir ist langweilig. Lass uns etwas anderes machen!
__label__de	Du musst viel Milch trinken; dann wirst du groß und stark.
__label__de	Wer will da schon wohnen?
__label__de	Der Klimawandel ist die größte Bedrohung, der wir gegenüberstehen.
__label__de	Es hat Tom geschmeckt.
__label__de	Wer zwei Dinge gleichzeitig macht, dem gelingt nichts von beidem.
__label__de	Das Klima hat sich immer geändert.
__label__de	Maria ist klug, verführerisch und erfolgreich.
__label__de	Ich will sie nicht verklagen.
__label__de	Ich muss ihn treffen.
__label__de	Das nennst du ein Zuhause?
__label__de	Ich habe kein Zuhause und keine Heimat.
__label__de	Ich will nicht, dass du das machst.
__label__de	Ich will nicht, dass du das tun musst.
__label__de	„Ich will nicht, dass du das machst. Wir haben Geld.“ – „Ich liebe es, das zu machen.“
__label__de	Siehst du, was ich machen muss, damit wir Geld haben?
__label__de	Das verkaufe ich nicht für Geld! Ich gebe es dir.
__label__de	Etliche Bauwerke der 2000 Jahre alten oder älteren Kulturen wurden vor langem von Ozeanen bedeckt, obgleich es Autos mit Verbrennungsmotoren nicht so lange gibt. Klimawandel gibt es immer.
__label__de	Das Phänomen kann man am Abendhimmel sehen.
__label__de	Anna: „Diese Schweine! Die solltest du verklagen, Hans!“ Maria: „Ein gutmütiger Mensch wie der Hans kommt doch gegen die nicht an. Die sind viel zu raffiniert.“
__label__de	Mein Anwalt hat gesagt, rein rechtlich gesehen könne man mir nicht kündigen.
__label__de	„Dieses Schwein! Verklagen würde ich den!“ – „Eine Klage hat kaum Aussicht auf Erfolg.“
__label__de	Parteien vertreten die eigenen Interessen der Parteien.
__label__de	Nach und nach verließen alle den Vortrag, und Tom stand am Ende allein da.
__label__de	Tom kann einem schon leid tun. Ich weiß nicht, wie der es mit Maria aushält.
__label__de	Wieviel hat Tom dir dafür bezahlt, dass du deine Familie verrätst?
__label__de	Schämst du dich nicht, deine Familie so im Stich zu lassen?
__label__de	Du? Ich mache hier fast alles!
__label__de	„Kommst du heute Mittag nach Hause?“ – „Nein, ich habe um zwei eine Besprechung.“
__label__de	Mir liegt die Sitzung im Magen – stundenlanges Gequatsche über Lappalien statt über die eigentlichen Probleme.
__label__de	Die Medien verwenden die Menschen als Toilettenschüssel.
__label__de	„Etwas Entscheidendes fehlt uns modernen Menschen.“ – „Ach, und wie würdest du das ausdrücken?“ – „Wir lieben uns nicht genug.“
__label__de	Anna klemmte Béla ein Blümchen unter den Scheibenwischer seines Wagens.
__label__de	Er sieht wie ein Cowboy aus.
__label__de	Die Toilette war besetzt.
__label__de	Ich habe einen Plan, aber ich brauche dich dafür.
__label__de	Er ist jung verwaist.
__label__de	„Wer sind Sie?“ – „Es kommt drauf an, wer das fragt.“
__label__de	Ich erkenne sie von hinten auch.
__label__de	Es klingelte; Anna öffnete; draußen stand Béla mit einem Blumenstrauß in der Hand.
__label__de	Warum riechst du nach Frauenparfum? Kommst du wirklich von der Arbeit, oder warst du noch woanders?
__label__de	„Es gibt Beweise, die sind aber nicht veröffentlicht worden.“ – „Woher weißt du denn dann, dass es sie gibt?“
__label__de	Heute gab es Königsberger Klopse mit Kapern und Kartoffeln.
__label__de	Wenn Papa etwas will, dann schafft er’s sofort, aber bei mir dauert’s Jahre.
__label__de	Sag ihm alles, was dich bedrückt.
__label__de	Er lässt sich nicht anmerken, dass er beleidigt ist.
__label__de	Weißt du, dass du mir schon lange nicht mehr gesagt hast, dass du mich liebhast?
__label__de	Zsuzsa merkte überhaupt nicht, dass Béla in Gedanken bei einer anderen Frau war.
__label__de	Jedesmal, wenn du abends zu mir kommst, bleibt mir fast das Herz stehen, und ich habe Angst, dass ich das alles nur träume und es nicht wahr ist, wenn ich aufwache.
__label__de	Ich weiß nicht, was ich tun soll. Ich denke Tag und Nacht nur noch an dich.
__label__de	Ich muss dich bitten, mich nie wiederzutreffen. Vielleicht können wir uns ja vergessen.
__label__de	Wir müssen uns vergessen. Es geht nicht anders.
__label__de	Ich liebe dich, aber ich kann nicht mit dir zusammensein. Bitte geh und triff mich nie wieder!
__label__de	Anna hat mir aus Spanien einen Hut „made in China“ mitgebracht.
__label__de	Du wirst morgen nicht mit irgendwelchen windigen Gestalten per Anhalter nach München fahren, sondern mit dem Zug. Die Fahrkarte kriegst du von mir.
__label__de	„Ihr werdet erst miteinander schlafen, wenn ihr verheiratet seid!“ – „Du lebst doch hinterm Mond!“
__label__de	„Statt zu studieren, solltest du lieber lernen, wie man einen Haushalt führt.“ – „Sag mal, in welchem Jahrhundert lebst du eigentlich?“
__label__de	Als ich so alt war wie du, da hatte ich schon drei Kinder.
__label__de	Das öffnet dem Missbrauch Tür und Tor.
__label__de	Ich bin anders, wenn ich ohne dich lebe.
__label__de	Das würde ich an deiner Stelle erst nach der Probezeit erzählen.
__label__de	Ich reichte ihm meine Hand, um ihm zu helfen.
__label__de	Für die Separatisten sollte man entweder ein rassistischer Hund oder ein Verräter sein.
__label__de	Verwenden Sie Glühbirnen, die kein Quecksilber enthalten.
__label__de	Gehören einige von Ihnen zur US-Handelsdelegation?
__label__de	Die Kosten waren so niedrig, dass viele Amerikaner sie kaufen konnten.
__label__de	Hat Tom Vorschläge für eine Übersetzung?
__label__de	Ich verbringe meine Zeit damit, verschiedene Dinge zu tun.
__label__de	Ich gehe singend auf Griechisch.
__label__de	Der Hund rennt und denkt, er hat eine Katze gesehen.
__label__de	In meinem Alter ist das Studium sehr anstrengend. Aber ich kann nicht widerstehen – ich lerne gerne.
__label__de	Wie hätte ich leben können, wenn mir die Gesellschaft eines Wörterbuchs verweigert worden wäre?
__label__de	Wenn sie so schön ist wie ihre Stimme ...
__label__de	Die Logik ist die Anatomie des Denkens.
__label__de	Arbeit um der Arbeit willen ist gegen die Natur.
__label__de	Wer sich besitzt, hat nichts verloren: Aber wie wenigen gelingt es, sich zu besitzen?
__label__de	Immer noch haben die die Welt zur Hölle gemacht, die vorgeben, sie zum Paradies zu machen.
__label__de	Ich kann mich nicht entscheiden.
__label__de	Das Eichhörnchen trug ein kleines Mäskchen.
__label__de	Du kannst nicht von Tom verlangen, alles, was ihn ausmacht, zu ändern.
__label__de	Du kannst nicht von Tom verlangen, alles, was ihn zu dem macht, der er ist, zu ändern.
__label__de	Man soll an die Welt denken, handeln aber für die Region.
__label__de	Denk an die Welt, für die Region aber handele!
__label__de	Denk an die Welt, und handele vor der eigenen Haustür!
__label__de	Was haben wir schon zu verlieren?
__label__de	„Wollen wir’s versuchen?“ – „Na klar! Was haben wir schon zu verlieren!“
__label__de	Als ich so alt war wie du, da war ich schon lange berufstätig.
__label__de	Die Eichhörnchen trugen beim Verlassen des Kobels immer eine Maske, hielten die Abstandsregeln ein und wuschen sich anschließend die Pfötchen mit Seife.
__label__de	Auf meiner Fensterbank hat sich ein Eichhörnchen ein Nest gebaut.
__label__de	Diese Leute sollten ihre blöde Rhetorik mal zurückfahren!
__label__de	Maria sitzt auf einem Jogaball.
__label__de	Wer sind Sie denn?
__label__de	Warum machst du es denn dann?
__label__de	Wer heute Winnetou verbietet, verbietet morgen die Bibel.
__label__de	Ich habe viele Dinge gesehen, indem ich dort war.
__label__de	Sie sah ihn lächelnd an.
__label__de	Hans ist von Julia mit der Bratpfanne erschlagen worden, weil sie ihn für einen Einbrecher hielt.
__label__de	Entschuldigen Sie. Wo bitte schön geht’s zum Rathaus?
__label__de	Neugriechisch ist eine bezaubernde Sprache.
__label__de	Die Schwalben reisen und fliegen von einem Land zum anderen.
__label__de	Ich entspanne mich, während ich klassische Musik höre.
__label__de	Wir verbrachten die Nacht damit Filme zu schauen.
__label__de	Was für eine bezaubernde Stimme! Unvergesslich!
__label__de	Gal Costa ist gestern, am 9. November 2022, im Alter von 77 Jahren verstorben.
__label__de	Ich hatte nicht vor, dir das zu sagen.
__label__de	Ihre Eltern sind Ukrainer.
__label__de	Seine Eltern sind Ukrainer.
__label__de	Seine Eltern leben in der Ukraine, seine Schwester in Deutschland, er selbst in Russland.
__label__de	Können Sie mir ein Stückchen Brot geben?
__label__de	Könnt ihr mir ein Stückchen Brot geben?
__label__de	Kannst du mir ein Stückchen Brot geben?
__label__de	Was schwer schien, erwies sich als einfach.
__label__de	Was einfach schien, erwies sich als schwer.
__label__de	Ich bemühe mich, keine Nachrichten zu sehen.
__label__de	Ich bemühe mich, weniger fernzusehen.
__label__de	Ich bemühe mich, nicht fernzusehen.
__label__de	Ich fühle mich für das, was passiert ist, verantwortlich.
__label__de	Inzwischen gibt es überall Kameras.
__label__de	Überall waren Kameras.
__label__de	Sie macht sich keine Sorgen mehr.
__label__de	Tom und Maria haben es mit einer internationalen Kundschaft zu tun.
__label__de	Ich habe diese Idee schon vor langem aufgegeben.
__label__de	Meine Frau ist krank, drum kümmere ich mich um die Kinder.
__label__de	Dieses Bild spricht mich an.
__label__de	Sie können an dieser Kasse nicht in bar zahlen.
__label__de	Wo immer du hingehst, es wird überall das Gleiche sein.
__label__de	Man hat uns alles genommen.
__label__de	Die Ausstellungsstücke bitte nicht anfassen!
__label__de	Peter hat mit 19 die Diagnose „HIV positiv“ bekommen.
__label__de	Ich muss routinemäßig einmal im Quartal zum Arzt.
__label__de	Es gibt viele Vorurteile. Davon müssen wir uns befreien.
__label__de	Wohin gehst du, junger Mann?
__label__de	Das sind zweimal 90 Tabletten. Ich muss von jeder eine am Tag nehmen.
__label__de	Hier gibt’s die besten Pommes der Stadt.
__label__de	Was geht einem bei dieser Diagnose durch den Kopf?
__label__de	Die meisten Infektionen kommen von Menschen, die gar nicht wissen, dass sie das Virus haben, weil sie den Test nicht machen.
__label__de	Die Hände mit Seife und warmem Wasser waschen!
__label__de	Herr Professor, ich habe eine Frage.
__label__de	Edinburgh ist Partnerstadt von Kiew.
__label__de	Tom schlüpfte in seine Jacke.
__label__de	Das ist nicht, was du sagtest, dass du tun wollest.
__label__de	Was für eine intelligente junge Frau!
__label__de	Ich wollte sie unbedingt küssen.
__label__de	Maria trug auf der Feier ein Hexenkostüm.
__label__de	Finden Sie alle Ampeln auf diesem Bild.
__label__de	Ich sah eine Chance und ergriff sie.
__label__de	Ich mag es, wenn du mich küsst.
__label__de	Es bot sich mir eine Chance, und ich nutzte sie.
__label__de	Bitte beruhige dich, ja?
__label__de	Es geht das Gerücht um, dass Tom dich leiden mag.
__label__de	Er ist nicht dein Feind.
__label__de	Ich liebe Berbersprachen.
__label__de	Wir hoffen, Ihre Anfrage damit beantwortet zu haben.
__label__de	Ich wollte keine Minute verlieren.
__label__de	Wie viele Einwohner hat das Land?
__label__de	Wer sind die Feinde der Jugend?
__label__de	Es regnet!
__label__de	Verzeihung!
__label__de	Ist das eine wörtliche Übersetzung?
__label__de	Kabylisch schreiben ist eigentlich ganz leicht. Nur die Lernunwilligen finden Ausreden.
__label__de	Die Konferenz findet im Gebäude des Instituts statt.
__label__de	Was hat der Ausschuss des Instituts gesagt?
__label__de	Oh, Marilla, du willst doch Green Gables nicht verkaufen!
__label__de	Bis die Kinder wieder zur Schule gehen, können viele Eltern nicht an den Arbeitsplatz zurückkehren.
__label__de	Sie schlief ein und wachte nie wieder auf.
__label__de	Was wollen die Leute?
__label__de	Er ist zu jung für mich.
__label__de	Diese Woche wurden im Zuge des Bemühens der Behörden, das neue Coronavirus aufzuhalten, Tausende von Schulen in den USA geschlossen.
__label__de	Menschen, die nach illegaler Einreise in die USA Asyl beantragen, wird es viel häufiger verwehrt als gestattet.
__label__de	Viele Überlebende wurden aus dem Wrack gerettet.
__label__de	Tom hat für seine Katze ein Konto in den sozialen Medien eröffnet.
__label__de	Wir müssen die Älteren respektieren.
__label__de	Das Mädchen hat dich, davon bin ich überzeugt, sehr lieb und zöge einen gutaussehenden Mann, so arm er auch sei, einem noch so reichen hässlichen Affen gewiss vor.
__label__de	Tom hat eine Wikipedia-Seite.
__label__de	Tom kann Geheimnisse nicht allzu gut für sich behalten.
__label__de	Maria gab zu, sich schon einmal in den Zauberkünsten versucht zu haben.
__label__de	Es ist erst drei Wochen her, seit sie kam, und schon scheint es, sie wäre immer hiergewesen.
__label__de	Tom, du solltest auch kommen.
__label__de	Warum hast du ihm nicht einfach eine reingehauen?
__label__de	Maria sah aus dem Fenster in die Ferne.
__label__de	Sie hasst mich ebensosehr wie ich sie.
__label__de	Ich denke, er weiß von uns.
__label__de	Er ist irgendwie ganz süß.
__label__de	„Es gibt eine ganz unschuldige Erklärung.“ – „Ich höre.“
__label__de	Das ist nichts, was mich interessiert.
__label__de	Wenn jemand im Präinternetzeitalter etwas Anstößiges im Fernsehen sagte, wandten sich die Leute brieflich an die Fernsehgesellschaft und teilten mit: „Ich schalte nicht mehr ein.“
__label__de	Heute werden diese wichtigen Lebensräume durch eine Vielzahl menschlicher Tätigkeiten bedroht.
__label__de	Wie viele Liter Wasser fasst eine normale Badewanne?
__label__de	Er hat eine falsche Altersangabe gemacht, um in die Disko zu kommen.
__label__de	Maria liebt die Natur.
__label__de	Der junge Mann hilft der älteren Frau über die Straße.
__label__de	Wo sind alle deine Brüder?
__label__de	Das war das letzte Mal, dass ich ihr Gesicht gesehen habe.
__label__de	Das Glück liegt auf dem Land.
__label__de	Das war das letzte Mal, dass ich sein Gesicht gesehen habe.
__label__de	Es hatte den Anschein, dass er von Misserfolgen verfolgt wurde.
__label__de	Die Enkelkinder besuchen ihre alten Großeltern.
__label__de	Ihr seid meine Gruppe von Freunden.
__label__de	Die Banken sind schön dick geworden.
__label__de	Die Banken sind durch die Menschen schön fett geworden.
__label__de	Dem Publikum hat es nicht gefallen.
__label__de	Milch macht stark.
__label__de	He, ich kenne Sie!
__label__de	Fruchtfliegen sind alle Alkoholiker.
__label__de	Warum funktioniert das denn nicht?
__label__de	Ich liebe dich, aber als Freund. Mehr kann zwischen uns nicht sein. Du weißt doch, dass ich lesbisch bin. Du kannst mich nicht umpolen.
__label__de	Schwule Männer waren für mich immer die besten Freunde.
__label__de	„Die Politiker haben eine falsche Entscheidung getroffen.“ – „Das ist klar. Aber warum fast jedes Mal?“
__label__de	Wegen der Politiker ist jetzt eine angebliche Energiekrise.
__label__de	„Ob Peter wohl noch sauer ist?“ – „Ach, der hat sich längst wieder eingekriegt.“
__label__de	Du könntest Peter ruhig etwas Anerkennung zukommen lassen, wo er sich so um dich bemüht.
__label__de	Er hat mich von hinten angegriffen.
__label__de	Was machen eigentlich deine Fahrstunden? Hast du nicht bald Prüfung?
__label__de	Auf unserer Hochzeitsreise in Griechenland, da hat deine Mutter auf dem Tisch getanzt. Sie war die Sensation des Abends.
__label__de	Es ist dringend, du musst jetzt gehen.
__label__de	Die Entscheidung ist gefallen: das Land hat einen neuen Präsidenten. Die einen freuen sich darüber; die anderen tragen es mit Fassung. Es gibt aber auch einige, die dem alten Präsidenten nachweinen.
__label__de	Es ist dringend, Sie müssen jetzt gehen.
__label__de	Es ist dringend, ihr müsst sofort gehen.
__label__de	Wie konntest du das vergessen?
__label__de	Wie kann man so was vergessen?
__label__de	Wie viel Hack hast du gekauft?
__label__de	Heute ist das Museum für die Öffentlichkeit zugänglich.
__label__de	Ich sehe, dass du immer noch hier bist.
__label__de	Ich habe einen dringenden Job im Zentrum.
__label__de	Ich wollte deine Stimme hören.
__label__de	Unser Team von Korrektoren ist sehr effizient.
__label__de	Das ist das Haustier meines Nachbarn.
__label__de	Ich hatte einen echten Freund.
__label__de	Ich hatte eine wahre Freundin.
__label__de	Danke, aber ich schaffe es alleine.
__label__de	Warum machst du das, was du machst?
__label__de	Stil haben: das heißt die Worte so setzen, dass die Gedanken spazieren können.
__label__de	Das Glück ist die Gesundheit der Seele.
__label__de	Angst zerstört unser Bewusstsein.
__label__de	Bedingungslose Liebe erschafft bedingungslose Freiheit und lässt Lebendigkeit leben.
__label__de	Ich habe einen interessanten Beruf, aber wir Journalisten verdrängen gerne wichtige Fragen - etwa, warum die Technik uns Menschen nicht glücklicher macht.
__label__de	Er hatte keinen roten Heller.
__label__de	Die Jugend hat ihre eigene Kultur.
__label__de	Wie sehen Sie mich?
__label__de	Ich will nicht, dass Ihre Frau die Freundin meines Mannes ist.
__label__de	O nein! Unser Patient ist tot.
__label__de	Hast du das Fenster richtig zugemacht?
__label__de	Wegen der lauten Musik habe ich nicht gehört, was der verdammte Nachbar geschrien hat.
__label__de	Im Fitnessraum läuft üblicherweise Trance.
__label__de	Warum zum Teufel bist du zurückgekommen?
__label__de	Wer hat Sie hereingelassen?
__label__de	Ich färbe mir die Haare schwarz.
__label__de	Er ist unfähig zu lieben.
__label__de	Wir waren drei Wochen auf dem Meer.
__label__de	Wir waren vor drei Wochen auf dem Meer.
__label__de	Frau von der Leyen erledigt Europas Milliardenangelegenheiten per SMS.
__label__de	Ich bin gekommen, um ihn zu retten.
__label__de	Die Medien lügen.
__label__de	Papa, es bringt doch nichts, sich diesen Mist anzusehen! Die lügen doch eh!
__label__de	Schwimmen in so großen Wellen!?
__label__de	Ich habe vergessen, mich zu kämmen.
__label__de	Ich weiß, dass du da bist! Hörst du mich?
__label__de	Mein Vater ist der Chef.
__label__de	Fruchtfliegen schwimmen in meinem Wein.
__label__de	Der Satz hat eine wellige Melodie.
__label__de	Wellen schlagen gegen die Felsen.
__label__de	Zuviel Salz verdirbt den Geschmack.
__label__de	Bei uns in der Nähe gibt es einen großen Park.
__label__de	Ich weiß noch, wie wir immer im Park gespielt haben.
__label__de	Die Wähler standen in endlosen Warteschlangen.
__label__de	Findest du nicht, dass Papa wie Oma redet?
__label__de	Mein Vater denkt an nichts anderes als seine Arbeit.
__label__de	Ihr Buch hat mein Leben verändert.
__label__de	Ich glaube, ich möchte, dass du bleibst.
__label__de	Die Adresse stimmt, aber das Büro ist weggezogen.
__label__de	Ich versuche, mir die Namen der Sternbilder zu merken.
__label__de	Bis Weihnachten ist es nicht mehr lange hin.
__label__de	Bitte reden Sie noch einmal mit Ihrem Mann. Es muss ins Krankenhaus. Sie sind der einzige Mensch, auf den er hört.
__label__de	Machen Sie Ihrem Mann Mut, gegen diese Krankheit anzukämpfen! Er darf sich jetzt nicht aufgeben.
__label__de	Wellen schlagen gegen die Felsen, wobei sie schließlich brechen.
__label__de	Ich will nicht ins Krankenhaus. Ich will keine Ärzte und Schwestern um mich herumhaben. Ich will bei dir bleiben.
__label__de	Ich werde dich nicht aufgeben.
__label__de	Sie neidet mir mein Glück.
__label__de	Wellen laufen auf die Küste zu.
__label__de	Mir gefällt mein Beruf.
__label__de	Ich bin froh, dass ich diesen Beruf gewählt habe.
__label__de	Zum Schlafen habe ich noch genug Zeit, wenn ich auf dem Friedhof liege. Jetzt will ich was erleben.
__label__de	Meine Wohnung ist im 17. Stock; Schlafzimmer und Wohnzimmer sind beide nach Süden ausgerichtet.
__label__de	Wellen belagern heftig die Felsen der Küste.
__label__de	So, da wären wir.
__label__de	„Sie ist attraktiv und hat Humor!“ – „Und kann sie kochen?“ – „Wen interessiert’s?“
__label__de	Tut mir leid, ich habe mich verwählt.
__label__de	Ich lese keine Zeitung.
__label__de	Der Innenminister ist der Mafiaboss.
__label__de	Diese Situation ist unangenehm für uns beide.
__label__de	Das konnte er nicht mehr sehen.
__label__de	Ich habe meine Tochter schon lange nicht mehr gesehen.
__label__de	Ich esse Pommes.
__label__de	Sein Körper ist wie der einer griechischen Skulptur.
__label__de	Wie viel Honig soll ich kaufen?
__label__de	Meine Katze hat eine Maus gefressen.
__label__de	Es handelt sich um einen seriösen Vortrag.
__label__de	Ich hab ihr angeboten beim Übersetzen zu helfen.
__label__de	Niemand hat meine Hausaufgaben für mich gemacht.
__label__de	Was machst du hier, junger Mann?
__label__de	O nein! O nein! Wie kann das sein?

__label__de	Wir waren kein Paar und sind es auch nicht.
__label__de	Was hat dir der Mann gesagt?
__label__de	Es scheint nur so, dass ein Jahr viel ist. Eh man sich’s versieht, ist es verflogen.

__label__de	Tom und Maria sind medikamentenabhängig.
__label__de	Ich hatte sie lieb – und ich liebe sie immer noch.

__label__de	Anna musste weinen, als es nach der Übernachtung bei ihrer Freundin Milena wieder nach Hause gehen sollte, denn das funktionierende Familienleben gefiel ihr, und sie wäre gerne noch länger geblieben. Zu Hause warteten nur eine alkoholkranke Mutter und ein gewalttätiger Vater auf sie.

__label__de	Ich habe dir Lesen und Schreiben beigebracht, und was ist aus dir geworden? Ein Dieb! Wenn das unsere Mutter wüsste!

__label__de	Ich schlafe unruhig und wenig.
__label__de	Tom hat seine Arbeit verloren und ist stark verschuldet.

__label__de	Wir haben das Thema ausführlich besprochen.
__label__de	Ihr sprecht sehr gut Deutsch.

__label__de	„Woher kann Anna eigentlich so gut Spanisch?“ – „Sie hat es einmal an einer Schule unterrichtet.“

__label__de	Das ist ein großes Kompliment.
__label__de	Können wir einen Tee zusammen trinken?
__label__de	Das ist sehr einfach für mich.
__label__de	Ich denke nicht, dass Tom ja sagen wird.
__label__de	Auf dem Tisch liegen einige Äpfel.
__label__de	Die Möbel kann ich auch selbst zusammenbauen.
__label__de	Ich kaufe keine Milchprodukte, weil ich eine Laktoseintoleranz habe.

__label__de	Auch Schritte der Vorsicht hinterlassen Spuren.
__label__de	Tom wurde von einem kräftigen Windstoß umgeblasen.
__label__de	Ich nehme an deinem Schmerz teil.

__label__de	Die Mutter meines Urenkels ist Russin.

__label__de	Es fällt schwer zu glauben, dass das wirklich passiert ist.

__label__de	Liberalismus ist die Ideologie, in der man moralisch und intellektuell mit Müll gefüttert wird.

__label__de	Du bist nicht krank.
__label__de	Ihr seid nicht krank.

__label__de	Glaubst du, sie mag dich leiden?
__label__de	Maria stellte ihn wegen seines Verhaltens zur Rede.

__label__de	Tom hat die Kekse anbrennen lassen.
__label__de	Das ist keine Regierung, sondern ein Witzfigurenkabinett.
__label__de	Wenn man auf seinen Kürper achtet, geht es auch dem Kopf besser.
__label__de	Tom ist eines natürlichen Todes gestorben.
__label__de	Entschuldigung, ich habe Sie mit einem Freund von mir verwechselt.

__label__de	Du wirst umziehen müssen.
__label__de	Um wieviel Uhr geht ihr schlafen?
__label__de	Um wieviel Uhr gehen Sie schlafen?
__label__de	Wir sind im Museum.
__label__de	Jeder hat Probleme, nicht nur du.
__label__de	Jeder hat Probleme, nicht nur ihr.
__label__de	Jeder hat Probleme, nicht nur Sie.
__label__de	Die meisten sind dagegen; nur wenige sind dafür. Trotzdem machen die meisten mit, und nur wenige leisten Widerstand. Wer Widerstand leistet, wird öffentlich ausgegrenzt und diffamiert.
__label__de	Ich lese keine Nachrichten mehr; ich kann es nicht mehr ertragen.
__label__de	Der Tod ist nur ein ungelöstes technisches Problem.
__label__de	Der kleine Mann wird mit großen Worten gefüttert.
__label__de	Es ist doch alles Scheiße!
__label__de	Es ist doch Scheiße, was du da machst!
__label__de	Ob ein Mensch klug ist, erkennt man an seinen Antworten. Ob ein Mensch weise ist, erkennt man an seinen Fragen.
__label__de	Manchmal kommen zu uns Freunde und die Familie.
__label__de	Neben dem Wohnzimmer ist die Küche.
__label__de	Die Stadt ist nicht weit von uns entfernt.
__label__de	Tom möchte Zahnarzt werden.
__label__de	Tom starb eines unnatürlichen Todes.
__label__de	Meiner Erachtens fehlt da eine Konjunktion.
__label__de	Das Gute kann nicht das Böse überwinden, weil dann das auch böse wäre.
__label__de	Was für eine kalte, kleine Hand! Erlauben Sie mir, sie aufzuwärmen.
__label__de	Ich habe es doch gesagt.
__label__de	Es geschah schneller, als man es sagen kann.
__label__de	Wann willst du nach Barcelona?
__label__de	Gibt es hier irgendetwas Billiges?
__label__de	Gibt es hier etwas Billiges?
__label__de	Was sie sagt, ist in gewissem Sinne richtig.
__label__de	Ist das Ronnis Fahrrad?
__label__de	Er war so unaufmerksam, in den falschen Zug einzusteigen.
__label__de	Ich würde gerne wissen, wie viele Milliarden unsere impotente Regierung für diese Coronascheiße hinausgeworfen und welchen Schaden sie in Summe für die Wirtschaft und die Menschen verursacht hat.
__label__de	Ich habe eine Menge Geld dafür bezahlt, dass ich mein eigenes Geld abgehoben habe.
__label__de	Diese Niederlage hat gezeigt, dass die brasilianische Mannschaft nicht so stark ist, wie man dachte.
__label__de	„Wurde bei Tom eine Lobotomie durchgeführt?“ – „Nein. Tom ist so.“
__label__de	Er hat mich gefragt.
__label__de	Wenn du meine Tochter berührst, breche ich dir beide Arme!
__label__de	Er hat sechs.
__label__de	Die Polizisten im Einsatz wussten nicht, dass er Politiker ist. Sie wurden gefeuert.
__label__de	Meine Nummer ist die Acht.
__label__de	Haben deine Eltern dich das Grüßen nicht gelehrt?
__label__de	„Haben dir deine Eltern nicht beigebracht, höflich zu sein?“ – „Hä?“
__label__de	Dieses Flugzeug ist ziemlich alt.
__label__de	Die Menschen beschäftigen sich mit diesen Fragen nicht, weil die Menschen ihre Zukunft nicht interessiert.
__label__de	Aber was ist auf der anderen Seite?
__label__de	Wir haben, ich nicht, eine Menge Trottel gewählt, um das Land zu regieren.
__label__de	Wer weiß noch, wie das geht?
__label__de	Wer weiß sonst noch, wie man das macht?
__label__de	Er hatte in jener Nacht einen schrecklichen Traum.
__label__de	Auf dem Platz versammelte sich eine riesige Menge Schaulustiger.
__label__de	Ich begreife einfach nicht, wie Kinder ticken.
__label__de	Wir sind alle Affen.
__label__de	Haben dir deine Eltern nicht beigebracht zu grüßen?
__label__de	Maria ist eine sorgende Ehefrau und Mutter.
__label__de	Tom verirrt sich leicht.
__label__de	Was immer ich auch tue, es gefällt ihr nicht.
__label__de	Wenn du Not hast, so klage sie dir und keinem anderen.
__label__de	Jeder ist verantwortlich für seine Taten; Politiker nicht. Was zum Teufel soll das?
__label__de	Die Menschen können durch ihre Ängste geführt werden.
__label__de	Ich trinke kein Bier, sondern nur Branntwein.
__label__de	Mülltonnen mit Rollen wurden auf die Straße geweht.
__label__de	Das ist die Straße, von der du mir erzählt hast.
__label__de	Das ist die Straße, von der ihr mir erzählt habt.
__label__de	Das ist die Straße, von der Sie mir erzählt haben.
__label__de	Verkaufen Sie hier Lebensmittel aus eigenem Anbau?
__label__de	Die Wellen barsten, und das Wasser floss über den Sand zurück.
__label__de	Die Sonne brannte, und auf den Straßen warf der Asphalt in der Hitze Blasen.
__label__de	Sie kniete sich neben ihn hin und fragte ihn nach seinem Namen.
__label__de	Sie kniete sich neben ihn hin und fragte ihn, wie er heiße.
__label__de	Ich dachte, du kämest mit.
__label__de	Niemand wagte es, mit dem Fahrstuhl bis ganz nach oben zu fahren.
__label__de	Niemand wagte es, mit dem Fahrstuhl ins oberste Stockwerk zu fahren.
__label__de	Im Café ist’s ruhig. Es sind nur ein paar Leute da.
__label__de	Frag mich nicht, Kumpel. Ich habe keine Ahnung.
__label__de	Jetzt bist du dran, etwas zu sagen.
__label__de	Jetzt bist du an der Reihe, etwas zu sagen.
__label__de	Tom hat abgewaschen.
__label__de	Das Wetter war warm, aber regnerisch.
__label__de	Das Laub hat sich verfärbt.
__label__de	Der Himmel war klar.
__label__de	Viele sind im Urlaub.
__label__de	Das muss sehr unangenehm für dich gewesen sein.
__label__de	Das muss sehr unangenehm für euch gewesen sein.
__label__de	Das muss sehr unangenehm für Sie gewesen sein.
__label__de	Meinst du, der Wackelpudding ist schon so fest, dass man ihn essen kann?
__label__de	Da die Straße heute Morgen feucht ist, muss es heute Nacht geregnet haben.
__label__de	Es hört doch sowieso keiner zu.
__label__de	Ich habe vor drei Tagen mit denen gesprochen.
__label__de	„Da ist es! Es ist noch geöffnet.“ – „Na bitte! Kein Grund zur Panik, oder?“
__label__de	Wie konntest du sie öffnen?
__label__de	Sie ist nicht fähig, einen Mann zu lieben.
__label__de	Meine Russischkenntnisse lassen sehr zu wünschen übrig.
__label__de	Wir haben diesen Sommer nicht viel Sonne gehabt.
__label__de	Meine Oma hat eine Speisekammer, wo sie Lebensmittel lagert.
__label__de	Das ist mein Lieblingsbuchladen.
__label__de	Wir verließen den Fahrstuhl.
__label__de	In weiten Teilen Ostschottlands scheint heute die Sonne.
__label__de	Menschen sind eine Einheit aus menschlichen Zellen, Bakterien und Pilzen.
__label__de	Man darf nicht ohne Fahrschein mit dem Zug reisen.
__label__de	Hast du eine Kamera mitgenommen?
__label__de	Wir müssen Tom in ein Krankenhaus bringen.
__label__de	Dass die Welt von 13 Bankiersfamilien geführt wird, ist nur eine Verschwörungstheorie; sie wird in Wirklichkeit von Eichhörnchen geführt.
__label__de	In meiner Kindheit war alles anders.
__label__de	Ich wärmte mich vor dem Kamin auf.
__label__de	„Was werden die Menschen von mir halten, wenn ich das tue?“ – „Das weiß ich nicht, und es interessiert mich auch nicht. Ich weiß nur, dass du, wenn du es nicht tust, ein feiger Hund bist.“
__label__de	Er ist krank zur Arbeit gegangen.
__label__de	Die Politik macht die Leute arm.
__label__de	Wollen wir loslegen?
__label__de	Erinnere dich gut daran!
__label__de	Tom ist ein Nachbar von uns.
__label__de	Ich spiele im Garten.
__label__de	Tom ist nicht allzu dick.
__label__de	Tom ist nicht so dick.
__label__de	Tom ist nicht sehr dick.
__label__de	Lass mich sehen, was du in der Tasche hast.
__label__de	Sie kann das Motorrad nicht sehen, wohl aber hören.
__label__de	Wir treffen uns morgen mit Tom.
__label__de	Nein, die Blumen sind nicht grün, sondern rot, weiß, gelb oder blau.
__label__de	Wir müssen nicht.
__label__de	Das ist das Hausboot, auf dem wir früher gewohnt haben.
__label__de	In den nächsten Tagen wird es kälter.
__label__de	Wir haben unser Bestes getan.
__label__de	Das sind die Besten.
__label__de	Ich bin jetzt zu müde, um mich mit ihm zu treffen.
__label__de	Der wahre Wert eines Menschen ist in erster Linie dadurch bestimmt, in welchem Grade und in welchem Sinn er zur Befreiung vom Ich gelangt ist.
__label__de	Ich werde um sieben Uhr frei sein.
__label__de	Wenn es kostenlos wäre, bräuchte ich es auch nicht.
__label__de	„Haben Sie etwas billigeres?“ – „Leider nicht. Das ist das billigste.“
__label__de	Das Unternehmen hat wegen der Wirtschaftskrise Pleite gemacht.
__label__de	Der Garten ist vom Regen nass.
__label__de	Vergiss nicht, Mayonnaise zu kaufen!
__label__de	Denk dran, Mayonnaise zu kaufen!
__label__de	Es war Herbst.
__label__de	Was ist dein Lieblingsstraßenimbiss?
__label__de	Der Lehrer hat bei der Klassenarbeit einen Schüler beim Spicken erwischt.
__label__de	Ich bin gerade erst gekommen.
__label__de	Es war deutlich ein Pfeifen zu hören.
__label__de	Bei Oma steht das Tor offen.
__label__de	Am meisten bedauerte ich es, Tom nicht eher zum Gehen aufgefordert zu haben.
__label__de	Wir sind mit der Fähre über den Kanal von Dover nach Calais gefahren.
__label__de	Maria verwandelte sich vor Toms Augen in eine Katze.
__label__de	Weißt du, was ich erfahren habe?
__label__de	Weißt du, worauf ich gekommen bin?
__label__de	Ich konnte das Auto, das vor einem LKW fuhr und gerade links abbiegen wollte, nicht sehen.
__label__de	Das Billigste ist, wenn du keine kaufst.
__label__de	Ein Jahr ist vorbei und noch eins.
__label__de	Oma hat den Einschleichdieb mit einem Nudelholz vom Hof verjagt.
__label__de	„Kaiser Magen“ hat schon wieder ein neues Gesetz gemacht, um die Bürger in eine schwierige Situation zu bringen.
__label__de	Es ist noch offen.
__label__de	Auf der Realschule haben wir in Englisch ‘Wuthering Heights’ („Sturmhöhe“) gelesen.
__label__de	Ich habe einen Jungen mit bunten Schuhen gesehen.
__label__de	Jemand hat dein Mobiltelefon draußen auf der Straße gefunden.
__label__de	Tom ging zu Boden, aber der Schiedsrichter ließ weiterspielen.
__label__de	Tom kommt nur unter „ferner liefen“.
__label__de	Ich erzähle dir nicht alles.
__label__de	Ich sage dir nicht alles.
__label__de	Es wäre besser, wenn er heute Abend da wäre.
__label__de	Wie ich so die Straße entlangging, traf ich Herrn Schmidt.
__label__de	Waren in der Bibliothek viele Leute?
__label__de	Ist das erste Komma hier notwendig?
__label__de	Acht bis sechzehn Uhr ist die typische Möbellieferantenzeitspanne.
__label__de	Keine Arbeit ist einfach.
__label__de	Ich habe das Komma weggenommen.
__label__de	Das Buch, das Tom auf Esperanto geschrieben hat, wurde in viele Sprachen auf der ganzen Welt übersetzt.
__label__de	Ich bin, wo du bist.
__label__de	Eine einfache Arbeit gibt es nicht.
__label__de	Ich gebe den armen Kindern, was ich kann.
__label__de	Natürlich bin ich empörend!
__label__de	Ihr zwei seid ein wunderschönes Paar.
__label__de	Dieses Bild erinnert mich an unsere glücklichen Tage in England.
__label__de	Der Fehler wurde behoben.
__label__de	Der Zugverkehr wurde wegen umgestürzter Bäume auf der Strecke unterbrochen.
__label__de	Er ist nicht in der Schule, weil er krank ist.
__label__de	Sind Sie sicher, dass Sie in der richtigen Straße sind?
__label__de	Bist du sicher, dass du in der richtigen Straße bist?
__label__de	Ich würde mal hinten im Laden bei den Dosenfrüchten nachsehen.
__label__de	Der Spieler donnerte einen Schuss gegen die Latte.
__label__de	Die Spielerin donnerte einen Schuss gegen die Latte.
__label__de	Ich zitterte vor Kälte, als ich nach draußen ging.
__label__de	Ich habe schon ein Ruderboot gemietet.
__label__de	Viele Bäume sind im Winter kahl.
__label__de	Sie hat chronische Bronchitis.
__label__de	Haben Sie schon Ihre Auffrischungsimpfung erhalten?
__label__de	Sie ist nicht mehr so schüchtern wie früher.
__label__de	Es ist bunter, als ich dachte.
__label__de	Tom fragte Maria, ob sie ihm eine Taschenlampe leihen könne.
__label__de	Tom fragte Maria, ob sie eine Taschenlampe habe, die sie ihm leihen könne.
__label__de	Meine Mutter hat Angst vor Aufzügen.
__label__de	Tom stand am Fenster und fing im schwindenden Licht an, Trompete zu spielen.
__label__de	Das Gerücht verbreitete sich in der Stadt wie ein Lauffeuer.
__label__de	„Wie viele Finger halte ich hoch, Winston?“ – „Vier.“
__label__de	Wann können wir den nächsten Teil sehen?
__label__de	Letztes Jahr war ich Ersti.
__label__de	Darf ich bitte das Zimmer sehen?
__label__de	Tom wird es sich wohl nicht anders überlegen.
__label__de	Gibt es im Vereinigten Königreich noch rote Eichhörnchen?
__label__de	Überall auf dem Weg lagen heruntergefallene Pflaumen.
__label__de	Tom drang auf den Schiedsrichter ein, aber es hatte keinen Zweck.
__label__de	Leider weit gefehlt!
__label__de	Das bunte Kleid gefällt mir besser.
__label__de	Den Tee hat sie im mittleren Schrank.
__label__de	Der Tee steht bei ihr im mittleren Schrank.
__label__de	Das ist ein schöner Stoff.
__label__de	Was du gesagt hast, stimmt in gewisser Weise.
__label__de	„Peter Koch hatte doch zwei Schwestern. Wie hießen die denn noch mal?“ – „Also, die eine hieß Anna, aber wie die andere hieß, das weiß ich auch nicht mehr.“ – „Magdalena!“ – „Ja, genau. Magdalena hieß die! Jetzt weiß ich’s wieder.“
__label__de	Wir haben vor nichts und niemandem Angst.
__label__de	Wir fürchten nichts und niemanden.
__label__de	Dabei ist es völlig egal, ob der Satz verneint oder affirmativ ist.
__label__de	Mir scheint, es gibt beide Varianten.
__label__de	Maria saß neben dem Ofen.
__label__de	Tom hat einen Tag nach Maria Geburtstag.
__label__de	Tom und Maria sitzen auf einer Parkbank.
__label__de	In den Bergen ist der Schnee geblieben.
__label__de	An den Namen des einen erinnere ich mich noch, aber nicht an den des anderen.
__label__de	An den Namen des einen erinnere ich mich noch, an den des anderen nicht mehr.
__label__de	Mama sagt, du sollst aufstehen.
__label__de	Auf den Straßen der Stadt war viel Verkehr.
__label__de	Diesen Sommer hatten wir nicht viel Sonnenschein.
__label__de	Maria legt in den eigenen vier Wänden als DJ auf.
__label__de	„Mama, mein Pullover hat unter der Achsel ein Loch.“ – „Dann nähe es zu! Du weißt doch, wo der Nähkorb ist.“
__label__de	Wann schließt der Markt?
__label__de	Wer klopft heute an die Tür?
__label__de	Mach noch eins und noch eins!
__label__de	Ostern ist das jährliche Fest der Christen, das an die Auferstehung Christi erinnert.
__label__de	Ich hasse unzuverlässige Menschen.
__label__de	Denkst du an das Mädchen, das du gestern gesehen hast?
__label__de	Das ist der Junge, dessen Vater Arzt ist.
__label__de	Wo sind die Äpfel, die ich gekauft habe?
__label__de	Zahlen werden für Toki Pona immer fremd sein.
__label__de	Dein Zimmer ist ziemlich minimalistisch eingerichtet.
__label__de	Wo ist das Haus?
__label__de	Er ist säkular.
__label__de	Ich bin in der dritten Klasse.
__label__de	Sami war in dieser Wohnung.
__label__de	Ich glaube, dass Tom keine Drogen nimmt.
__label__de	Du stellst fast nie Fragen.
__label__de	Wie du dich entscheidest, werde ich es tun.
__label__de	Der Mensch ist ein federloser Zweifüßler.
__label__de	Wer so etwas sagt, weiß nicht, was er sagt.
__label__de	Das ist der Brief, den ich geschrieben habe.
__label__de	Die Wohnung strahlt von Sauberkeit.
__label__de	Dies ist die Uhr, die ich gekauft habe.
__label__de	Du kannst schreiben, was du willst.
__label__de	Ich komme im Oktober zurück nach Boston.
__label__de	Kinder sind manchmal ungeduldig.
__label__de	Tom schaute auf die Blumen und dachte, dass sie schön seien.
__label__de	Mary sagt, dass sie viel zu tun hat.
__label__de	Ich hatte nicht viel Zeit, um meine Hausaufgaben abzuschließen.
__label__de	Ich war fast die ganze Nacht wach.
__label__de	Ich bin ziemlich sicher, dass Mary das getan hat, worum wir sie gebeten hatten.
__label__de	Tom und Mary gehen manchmal zusammen essen.
__label__de	Das ganze Haus hat gewackelt.
__label__de	Ich habe Tom gesagt, nicht zu schnell zu fahren.
__label__de	Ich möchte zu dem Laden gehen, wo Tom arbeitet.
__label__de	Ihren Hunger kann kein Essen stillen.
__label__de	Wenn die Maus satt ist, schmeckt das Mehl bitter.
__label__de	Die Arbeiter haben keinen Anreiz, härter zu arbeiten.
__label__de	Warum haben Menschen zwei Nasenlöcher?
__label__de	Yanni stopfte etwas Toilettenpapier in sein blutendes Nasenloch.
__label__de	Wenn mein linkes Nasenloch verstopft ist, atme ich durch mein rechtes.
__label__de	Er hasst Rüben.
__label__de	Tom hasst Rüben.
__label__de	Tom aß eine Rübe.
__label__de	Yanni kratzte das restliche Harz ab.
__label__de	Tom verbrachte den Rest der Nacht damit, an Mary zu denken.
__label__de	Sami wird den Rest seines Lebens im Gefängnis verbringen.
__label__de	Der indonesische Satz ist eine perfekte Übersetzung seines englischen Gegenstücks.
__label__de	David hat Goliath mit einer Schleuder getötet.
__label__de	Mein Arm ist in einer Schlinge.
__label__de	Brilliante Menschen haben eine große Schwäche - sie wissen nicht zu verlieren.
__label__de	Ich bin neunundachtzig Jahre alt.
__label__de	Als die Besprechung vorbei war, machten sie sich sofort an die Arbeit.
__label__de	Wie ist deine Klausur gelaufen?
__label__de	Sie sind hier gerade erst angekommen.
__label__de	Wir sind hier gerade erst hier angekommen.
__label__de	Er hat ihr verschiedene Knoten beigebracht.
__label__de	Das Gebäude hat eine hohe Decke und ist gut belüftet.
__label__de	Jo versteht sich aufs Tapezieren.
__label__de	Diesen Wasserhahn nicht benutzen!
__label__de	Lanzarote ist eine spanische Insel.
__label__de	Sie essen mehr als ich.
__label__de	Ihr esst mehr als ich.
__label__de	Die Wellen barsten, und das Wasser floss durch den Kies zurück.
__label__de	In diesem Stadtteil kennen die sich nicht sonderlich gut aus.
__label__de	Diese Farben stehen dir.
__label__de	Diese Farben stehen euch.
__label__de	Diese Farben stehen Ihnen
__label__de	Keira hat sich gerade aufgemacht, um ihre Klausurergebnisse abzuholen.
__label__de	Wir saßen stundenlang am Bahnhof und warteten auf einen Zug.
__label__de	Tom wird wohl nicht an der Konferenz teilnehmen.
__label__de	Du bist nicht der einzige!
__label__de	Du bist nicht die einzige!
__label__de	Sie sind nicht der einzige!
__label__de	Du bist nicht der einzige.
__label__de	Du bist nicht die einzige.
__label__de	Sie sind nicht der einzige.
__label__de	Sie sind nicht die einzige.
__label__de	Tom sah sich die Blumen an und fand sie schön.
__label__de	Tom ist ein Vorkämpfer zur Rettung unseres Planeten.
__label__de	Denkt ja nicht nach, denn das ist ja zu anstrengend.
__label__de	Wir werden wegen der Politiker dunkle Weihnachten haben.
__label__de	Valli ist im Herzen ein sehr guter Mensch, aber, vielleicht gerade deswegen, auch äußerst naiv.
__label__de	Ah, unser Sohn ist ein Nichtsnutz wie unsere Politiker!
__label__de	Ich tue, was ich bisher getan habe.
__label__de	Wenn du so weitermachst wie bisher, wird sich nichts ändern.
__label__de	Sie stiegen aus dem Bus und gingen in der heißen Sonne zwei Kilometer zu Fuß.
__label__de	Sie fahren fast jeden Tag mit dem Auto zum Laden, obwohl sie weniger als einen Kilometer weit entfernt wohnen.
__label__de	Die beiden stiegen aus dem Bus und gingen im heißen Sonnenschein zwei Kilometer zu Fuß.
__label__de	„Ich habe damals als Kellner gearbeitet.“ – „In einer Cocktailbar?“ – „Woher weißt du das?“
__label__de	Wer hat diesen Baum gefällt?
__label__de	Aber nur wenige sind lesenswert.
__label__de	Was soll ich zum Abendessen machen?
__label__de	Sie stellten sich ins Wartehäuschen einer Bushaltestelle, um dem Regen zu entgehen.
__label__de	Sie stellten sich an einer Bushaltestelle unter, um dem Regen zu entgehen.
__label__de	„Viele Typen lassen sich jetzt einen Schnurrbart wachsen. Wie bescheuert ist das bitte schön?“ fragte sie rhetorisch. „Mein Bruder hat einen, und da krieg’ ich echt die Krise.“
__label__de	Sie sind nicht die einzigen.
__label__de	Ihr seid nicht die einzigen.
__label__de	Sag, was du willst – ich mache, was ich will!
__label__de	Ich habe getan, was du mir empfohlen hast.
__label__de	Wir gehen Mittag essen.
__label__de	Die meisten sind gekommen.
__label__de	Die Mehrheit ist da.
__label__de	Tom, der Riese, war als Held gefeiert, nachdem der aus den Politikern einen Schaschlik gemacht hatte. Er aß die Feiernden auch.
__label__de	Wir befinden uns im zweiundzwanzigsten Jahr des einundzwanzigsten Jahrhunderts.
__label__de	Das kann man jetzt nicht mehr rückgängig machen.
__label__de	Respektable Politiker, denn man noch vertrauen kann, wären schön.
__label__de	Den Schaden kann man nicht mehr rückgängig machen.
__label__de	Du bist jung und verspielt, und alles fällt dir leicht.
__label__de	Ihr seit jung und spielerisch, und alles ist leicht für euch.
__label__de	Ähm, einmal Cheeseburger. Nein, doch nicht. Oder doch? Also, lieber einmal Chickenburger, zweimal bitte!
__label__de	Sie liest in einem Jahr so viele Bücher wie die meisten nicht einmal ihr ganzes Leben lang.
__label__de	Ich würde das Gleiche tun.
__label__de	Er war einer meiner besten Freunde.
__label__de	Er war einer meiner größten Freunde.
__label__de	Maria ist eine intelligente Frau.
__label__de	Ich finde das Buch sehr interessant.
__label__de	Tom ist ein alter Freund aus meiner Jugend.
__label__de	Ich glaube, dieses Buch ist sehr informativ.
__label__de	Er saß da ​​und las ein Buch.
__label__de	Kommunikation besteht bekanntlich nicht allein aus der Sprache.
__label__de	Tom hat in einer Nacht ein Vermögen verspielt.
__label__de	Ich denke, sie verstehen es einfach nicht.
__label__de	Besser können wir es nicht machen.
__label__de	Tom widerstand der Versuchung.
__label__de	Ich nehme an, dass Tom heute hier sein wird.
__label__de	Danke für den Kaffee.
__label__de	Ich hoffe, dass du nicht enttäuscht sein wirst.
__label__de	Vergleich dich nicht immer mit anderen.
__label__de	Samis Geschichte war sehr langweilig.
__label__de	Er hatte mir nicht zugehört.
__label__de	Lege die roten Äpfel hierhin und die grünen dorthin.
__label__de	Wo hat sie diese Bücher gekauft?
__label__de	Ich trinke fast nie Bier vor dem Mittag.
__label__de	Er ist ein Gelehrter.
__label__de	Kannst du die Frage anders formulieren? Ich bin mir nicht sicher, ob ich sie richtig verstehe.
__label__de	Der Tod ist am Ende jedes Schicksals.
__label__de	Ich will das nicht übersetzen.
__label__de	Wir haben unseren anderen Partner das ganze Jahr über nicht gesehen.
__label__de	Das Leben ist nicht nur Vergnügen und Spaß.
__label__de	Und ich trinke immer Milchkaffee.
__label__de	Ich werde ihr Kekse kaufen.
__label__de	Er ist es, der aufgibt.
__label__de	Schmollen sie mit dir?
__label__de	Ziehen wir die Badeanzüge an und gehen schwimmen.
__label__de	Queiroz sagte, das Wetter in Griechenland sei gut.
__label__de	Wieviel Obst hast du gegessen?
__label__de	Wieviel Obst habt ihr gegessen?
__label__de	Wieviel Obst haben Sie gegessen?
__label__de	Bei den Nachbarn ist schon wieder Streit.
__label__de	Die Besprechung wurde auf morgen vertagt.
__label__de	Mir ist es diese Woche viel zu heiß.
__label__de	Hast du den Kuchen probiert, den Tom gebacken hat?
__label__de	Ich bin eine halbe Stunde vom Hotel entfernt.
__label__de	Sie hat gestern lange wach gesessen.
__label__de	Die Stadt hat einen langen Sandstrand.
__label__de	Welches ist seins?
__label__de	Welches ist ihrs?
__label__de	Wohnt er hier in der Nähe?
__label__de	Es gab verschiedene Süßigkeiten.
__label__de	Die Fischerboote haben den Hafen verlassen.
__label__de	Danke, dass du so früh gekommen bist!
__label__de	Danke, dass ihr so früh gekommen seid!
__label__de	Danke, dass Sie so früh gekommen sind!
__label__de	Ich weiß noch nicht, ob ich Sterne bekommen werde.
__label__de	Ich gehe nach Stockholm.
__label__de	Zwei Verliebte haben den Zug verpasst.
__label__de	Er kennt sich in diesem Teil der Stadt nicht sonderlich gut aus.
__label__de	Sie hat zwar einen Liebling unter ihren Kindern, aber sie fände es gemein zu sagen, welches.
__label__de	Sie sind hier am falschen Bahnhof.
__label__de	Du bist hier am falschen Bahnhof.
__label__de	Ihr seid hier am falschen Bahnhof.
__label__de	Ich werde dir das Foto zeigen.
__label__de	Ich werde euch das Foto zeigen.
__label__de	Ich werde Ihnen das Foto zeigen.
__label__de	Das ist noch nicht dagewesen.
__label__de	Der Fluss biegt hier leicht nach rechts ab.
__label__de	Ihr Verhalten mir gegenüber war anders als sonst.
__label__de	Ich ertrage dein Verhalten nicht mehr.
__label__de	Die begeben sich auf unbekanntes Terrain.
__label__de	Der Ball flog oben aufs Netz.
__label__de	Ich komme am 23. Mai an.
__label__de	Bei Oma quietscht das Eingangstor, wenn es geöffnet wird.
__label__de	Ich bestreiche meinen Toast gern dünn mit Marmelade.
__label__de	Dieser Film ist eine Komödie.
__label__de	So werde ich mich immer an sie erinnern.
__label__de	„Ich dachte, du kämst mit.“ – „Da hast du falsch gedacht.“
__label__de	Das ist ihr Auto, glaube ich.
__label__de	Den Entwicklungsstand einer Zivilisation bewertet man an seiner Raumfahrttechnologie.
__label__de	Das Leben beginnt mit ganz vielen Geschenken die man am Ende alle wieder verliert.
__label__de	Nichts im Universum ist kompliziert, es ist nur eine Frage der Intelligenz.
__label__de	Freier Wille ist eine Einbildung der Intelligenz.
__label__de	Je größer der Horizont, desto bescheidener ist man.
__label__de	Diejenigen die behaupten, dass im Universum kein anderes Leben auf anderen Planeten existiert, haben scheinbar vergessen, dass sie selbst auf einem Planeten im Universum leben.
__label__de	Die Kunst ist Statthalter der Utopie.
__label__de	Das ist nicht nur mein Problem.
__label__de	Sie haben die hässliche Kandidatin nicht eingestellt.
__label__de	Bis kurz vor 7.
__label__de	Sie stellt sich vor.
__label__de	Ich hab' dir doch gesagt, dass Mary nicht kommen wird.
__label__de	Verfinstere nie wieder meine Türschwelle!
__label__de	Erdbeerbäume sind immergrüne Bäume.
__label__de	Tauch nie wieder auf!
__label__de	Niemand hat Tom darüber informiert.
__label__de	Alle Zimmer verfügen über ein Badezimmer und einen Fernsehapparat.
__label__de	Diese Spritze wird den Schmerz betäuben helfen.
__label__de	Mein Bus hatte Verspätung.
__label__de	Er nannte kühl die Gründe für seine Anwesenheit.
__label__de	Edinburgh, so sehen wir uns wieder!
__label__de	Machen wir ein halbes Stündchen Kaffeepause!
__label__de	Die Höchsttemperaturen liegen heute zwischen 21 und 23 Grad im Norden und bei 18 Grad überall sonst.
__label__de	Ich schreibe jeden Abend.
__label__de	Es ist kurz vor halb 3.
__label__de	Tom hat bereits 27 Sprachen gelernt, spricht aber nur Englisch, seine Muttersprache.
__label__de	Kein Zahlensystem kann mit Toki Pona kompatibel sein.
__label__de	Wie viele Tassen Tee am Tag trinken die Briten?
__label__de	Wir sagen es nicht hinter ihrem Rücken, sondern ihr direkt ins Gesicht.
__label__de	Ich bin gerade gegangen.
__label__de	Ich kann meinen Koffer nicht finden. Wo hast du es hingelegt?
__label__de	Ich verspreche, dass wir auf alles hören werden, was du sagst.
__label__de	Ich verspreche, dass wir auf alles hören werden, was Sie sagen.
__label__de	Ich verspreche, dass wir auf alles hören werden, was ihr sagt.
__label__de	Dein Mobiltelefon war ausgeschaltet.
__label__de	Ihr Mobiltelefon war ausgeschaltet.
__label__de	Euer Mobiltelefon war ausgeschaltet.
__label__de	Die Autobahn ist in südlicher Fahrtrichtung wegen eines umgestürzten Baumes gesperrt.

Du beschreibst mehr oder weniger, wie mein Partner und ich immer Heiligabend verbringen. Das ist immer eine Wahnsinnshetzerei.“ – „Eigentlich habe ich mir das als Telefongespräch vorgestellt, bei dem der zweite Sprecher dem ersten am Telefon den Weg zu einem Geschäft erklärt hat. Es könnte sich aber auch um ein persönliches Gespräch handeln, das stattfindet, als das noch geöffnete Geschäft gerade in Sicht kommt.“

__label__de	Er ist ziemlich intelligent und unendlich dumm.
__label__de	Was hat sie sonst noch gesagt?

__label__de	Weinen sie, weil sie berührt oder traurig sind?
__label__de	Haben Sie diese Schuhe auch in größerer Ausfertigung?
__label__de	Dieser Satz ist eine Übersetzung aus dem Esperanto.
__label__de	Sie haben eine Übersetzung aus dem Türkischen angefertigt. Beachten Sie, dass der Satz, den Sie übersetzen, in der Liste ganz oben stehen muss (wie jetzt der russische). Um den benötigten Satz nach oben zu verschieben, muss man auf den Pfeil links daneben klicken.
__label__de	Als Marilyn Monroe 1962 Selbstmord beging, fertigte Warhol eine Reihe von Gemälden an, die auf ihrem Foto basierten.

__label__de	Ein Skandal!

__label__de	Was hat dir das Christkind gebracht?
__label__de	Die roten Äpfel hat er gegessen; die grünen hat er liegenlassen.
__label__de	Diese Äpfel werden nicht rot, sondern nur gelb, wenn sie reif sind.
__label__de	Der Apfel ist ja noch ganz grün. Lass den lieber noch etwas liegen, eh’ du ihn isst!
__label__de	Ich wäre ihr an seiner Stelle auch weggelaufen.
__label__de	Wo willst du denn so aufgedonnert hin?
__label__de	Charakterlich könnten Tom und Maria verschiedener nicht sein.

__label__de	Ich schaffe es ohne seine Hilfe.
__label__de	Das Konzert schien zu Ende zu sein.
__label__de	Es war ganz anders, als sie gedacht hatte.
__label__de	Letzten Endes trug seine Forschung Früchte.
__label__de	Auf unserem Gymnasium wurde Latein nur einigen Schülern als Wahlfach angeboten.
__label__de	Wir sollten wohl mal darüber reden.
__label__de	Der Aufstand begann am 1. August.
__label__de	Er ist mit Vollgas davongefahren, ohne dass er gesagt hätte, wohin.

__label__de	Die drei Männer hatten zusammen 50 Pfund.
__label__de	Ich bin nicht so blöd zu glauben, dass es den Weihnachtsmann nicht gibt.

__label__de	England war einst von einem Bürgerkrieg zerrissen.
__label__de	Tom weiß, dass Maria ihn nicht mehr liebt.
__label__de	Wenn ich so lachen muss, schaffe ich es nicht, die Kerze auszublasen.
__label__de	Darüber mache ich mir nicht die geringsten Sorgen.
__label__de	Mir auch.
__label__de	Ich ziehe die Liebe dem Hass vor.
__label__de	Versteckt er sich aus Scham oder Schuldgefühlen?
__label__de	Es besteht nicht der geringste Zweifel, dass die französische Mannschaft die beste ist.
__label__de	Die Politiker wollten den Krieg nicht, aber die Menschen schon.
__label__de	Die Politik dient den Großkapitalisten und schützt diese.
__label__de	Tom ist wie Pu der Bär: dick und dumm und noch böse dazu.
__label__de	Der Franzose war hier.

__label__de	Sami hatte nicht, wie versprochen, Laylas Fahrrad repariert.
__label__de	Ich hätte Französisch lernen sollen.
__label__de	Tom gab zu, dass es sein Fehler war.
__label__de	Ich denke, dass das Toms Schuhe sind.
__label__de	Ich hätte nichts anderes erwartet.
__label__de	Tom scheint nicht dazusein.
__label__de	Er ist nicht der Messias.
__label__de	Er stieg zum Feldwebel auf.
__label__de	Tom wirkte skeptisch.
__label__de	Ist das der Elektriker?
__label__de	Ist das die Elektrikerin?
__label__de	Es hat geregnet. Die Straßen sind nass.
__label__de	Hast du dich in deinem neuen Haus schon eingelebt?
__label__de	Habt ihr euch in eurem neuen Haus schon eingelebt?
__label__de	Haben Sie sich in Ihrem neuen Haus schon eingelebt?
__label__de	Sie brauchen nicht zu kommen.
__label__de	Wie 1872, so 2021: England und Schottland spielten ein torloses Unentschieden.
__label__de	Es war allen klar, dass er es ernst meinte.
__label__de	Eine Maus ist kein großes Tier.
__label__de	Zum Unglück der Politiker wollen die Fakten mit ihnen keine Kompromisse machen.
__label__de	Das Mit-der-Faust-auf-den-Tisch-schlagen nimmt ab, wenn er gedeckt ist.

__label__de	Toms Alibi wurde von seiner Katze bestätigt.
__label__de	Warum sitzt du auf dem Tisch?
__label__de	„Kann ich helfen?“ – „Du könntest, aber du kannst nicht.“
__label__de	Das ist gang und gäbe.
__label__de	„Ich habe Gott gefunden.“ – „Und wo?“ – „Auf dem Meer.“
__label__de	Auf dem Meer war ich alleine mit Gott.
__label__de	Ein Blitz schlug in einen Stein ein und so entstand das Leben.
__label__de	Was hat dir der Weihnachtsmann gebracht?
__label__de	Alle politischen Ideologien sind Produkte der Finanz- und Machtspekulationen, die dazu dienen, Menschenmengen zu beeinflussen und sie wie eine Schafherde zu hüten.
__label__de	Du hast meine Frage immer noch nicht beantwortet.
__label__de	Rufen Sie uns an, wenn Ihnen eventuell doch etwas einfällt.
__label__de	Du bist nach Griechenland gekommen und hast es mir nicht gesagt.
__label__de	Meine Tochter macht mir so viel Freude.
__label__de	Der Film fängt in der Mitte der Geschichte an.
__label__de	Der billige Wein ist dem teureren unterlegen.

__label__de	Ich würde sehr gerne in Deutschland arbeiten, aber ich spreche die Sprache nicht.
__label__de	Ich möchte in Deutschland arbeiten, aber ich kann die Sprache nicht.
__label__de	Tom gab zu, dass es seine Schuld war.
__label__de	Es war sehr offensichtlich.
__label__de	Hat Tom irgendwas darüber zu dir gesagt?
__label__de	Es stellte sich heraus, dass sie seine Schwester war.
__label__de	Tom studiert Geologie.
__label__de	Du solltest jetzt nicht essen.
__label__de	Das ist für Ziri eine schwierige Zeit.
__label__de	Das ist eine schwierige Zeit für Ziri.
__label__de	Sie liefen ihrem Hund hinterher.
__label__de	„Sei in Zukunft vorsichtiger!“ – „Jawohl.“ – „Nun gut, du kannst gehen.“
__label__de	„Schatz, ich mache mir schon wieder Sorgen.“ – „Worum denn?“
__label__de	Es tut mir leid. Ich habe mich so gefreut, dass ich nicht den Mund halten konnte.
__label__de	Ich kann nicht schlafen. Was soll ich tun?
__label__de	Ich bitte dich, sei mir nicht böse.
__label__de	Die Zeit kann man nicht anhalten, aber man kann sie festhalten.
__label__de	Ein Handwerker benötigt, wenn das Werk gelingen soll, nicht nur Werkzeug und Material, sondern auch ein Herz und eine Seele.
__label__de	Ich stehe schon seit einer halben Stunde in der Schlange.
__label__de	Der Sport hat ihn zu dem gemacht, was er ist.
__label__de	Ich weiß nicht, wie das Lied heißt. Wie heißt es?
__label__de	Ich kenne den Titel des Liedes nicht. Wie lautet er?
__label__de	Wir haben uns gestern bei einem Tee unterhalten.
__label__de	Die haben mir geholfen, den Kühlschrank anzuheben.
__label__de	Die Besprechung fand in lockerer Atmosphäre statt.
__label__de	Handelt es sich dabei um das Schlafzimmer?
__label__de	Unser Fußballspiel wird vertagt.
__label__de	Es wurden Toms Kenntnisse oder vielmehr deren Fehlen diskutiert.
__label__de	Diesen Sommer möchte ich sehr gerne an den Strand.
__label__de	Welchen Doctor Who findest du am besten?
__label__de	„Wo ist denn meine Brille?“ – „Weit weg kann sie nicht sein.“
__label__de	Könntest du denen 50 Euro leihen?
__label__de	Tom konnte nicht studieren.
__label__de	Ich gebe dir mein Ehrenwort.
__label__de	Ich gebe euch mein Ehrenwort.
__label__de	Ich gebe Ihnen mein Ehrenwort.
__label__de	Im Laufe der Nacht kommt es zu Gewitterschauern.
__label__de	Das muss dich ein Vermögen gekostet haben.
__label__de	Das muss euch ein Vermögen gekostet haben.
__label__de	Das muss Sie ein Vermögen gekostet haben.
__label__de	Tee wurde hauptsächlich nach Europa ausgeführt.
__label__de	Tom müsste mittlerweile schlafen.
__label__de	Die meisten Studenten stimmen dem Vorschlag zu und haben eine Liste mit Argumenten, die dafür sprechen, zusammengestellt.
__label__de	Sie erwiderte ihr Lächeln.
__label__de	Ich habe ihn seitdem kennenlernen können.
__label__de	Keiner von uns wagte es, mit dem Fahrstuhl ins oberste Stockwerk zu fahren.
__label__de	Sie bereiteten das Abendessen zu.
__label__de	Die Anwesenden waren überwiegend Studenten.
__label__de	Anwesend waren überwiegend Studenten.
__label__de	Herr Wald kam an die Tür und sprach mit Tonis Mutter.
__label__de	Früher waren in der Stadt Bootsbauerfamilien ansässig.
__label__de	Im Grunde seines Herzen glaubt Tom es nicht.
__label__de	Das Schiff ging in Kōbe vor Anker.
__label__de	Er lernte fleißig in der Absicht, ein Stipendium zu erlangen.
__label__de	Das ist ein Stück Kreide.
__label__de	Winde im März und im April dann Regen bescheren im Mai einen Blumensegen.
__label__de	Du brauchst dir keine allzu großen Sorgen zu machen.
__label__de	Er drosch das Getreide.
__label__de	„Was sollen wir mit dem Müll machen, Herr Waldmann?“ fragte Fips.
__label__de	„Was sollen wir mit dem Müll machen, Mr. Wood?“ fragte Pip.
__label__de	Manche scheinen schon gar nicht mehr zu wissen, wie es vor dem Krieg war.
__label__de	„Arbeite ich härter, bekomme ich mehr Geld.“ – „Ja, ja. Arbeitest du härter, bekommst du einen Leistenbruch.“
__label__de	Die Arbeiter sparen, während die Politiker das Geld vergeuden.
__label__de	Das Geld, das die Leute sparen, werfen die Politiker zum Fenster hinaus.
__label__de	Die Arbeiter geben den Politikern mehr als die Hälfte ihres Lohnes, nein, die Politiker nehmen sich dieses Geld und verschleudern es wie die Leute auf der Wiesn und machen dann auch noch neue Schulden.
__label__de	Sag mir nicht, was ich tun soll!
__label__de	Sie ist so hübsch, dass mir immer schwindelig wird, wenn ich sie sehe.
__label__de	Tom, der Bergtroll, trat den Premier aus Zorn so stark, dass dieser wie ein Komet durch den Andromedanebel flog.
__label__de	Nie.
__label__de	Das Wort „Politik“ ist ein Synonym für „Korruption“.
__label__de	Der Waldschrat trat dem Premierminister vor Wut mit solcher Wucht in den Allerwertesten, dass dieser über die sieben Berge zu den sieben Zwergen flog.
__label__de	„Wie kommt es eigentlich, dass Tom bei dir in letzter Zeit so sein Fett wegkriegt? Hat er dir etwas getan?“ – „Etwas getan? Das ist gar kein Ausdruck!“
__label__de	Die Reise dauert zwei Tage mit dem Zug und zwei Stunden mit dem Flugzeug.
__label__de	Auf der Landebahn stehen keine Flugzeuge.
__label__de	Ich weiß gar nicht, wie ich euch danken soll.
__label__de	Ich weiß gar nicht, wie ich Ihnen danken soll.
__label__de	Ich weiß gar nicht, wie ich dir danken soll.
__label__de	Rasul kommt aus Tadschikistan, und in seiner Heimat hat er das Käserhandwerk gelernt.
__label__de	Habe ich alles richtig gemacht?
__label__de	Das Ticket für die U-Bahn ist billig.
__label__de	Die Fahrkarte für die U-Bahn ist billig.
__label__de	Babys brauchen Liebe.
__label__de	Säuglinge brauchen Liebe.
__label__de	Das deprimiert mich.
__label__de	Romeo ist der Mann, in den Julia verliebt ist.
__label__de	Wir lasen die Romane.
__label__de	Sie ist stolz darauf, hübsch zu sein.
__label__de	Das ist nicht wahr und Sie wissen das.
__label__de	Ich habe Obstbäume auf meinem Feld gepflanzt.
__label__de	Wie könnte man es besser machen?
__label__de	Ich kann keinen Tee ohne Zucker trinken.
__label__de	Das ist kein vollständiger Satz. Bitte ändern Sie ihn, um einen daraus zu machen.
__label__de	„Wie Tom hier den großen Zampano markiert, das geht mir bis hier.“ – „Mir auch.“
__label__de	Der Laden ist gegenüber der Bank.
__label__de	Der Laden befindet sich gegenüber der Bank.
__label__de	Gibt es in der Wohnung zwei Badezimmer?
__label__de	„Aufwachen!“ – „Ich bin wach!“
__label__de	Ich glaube, bei unseren Nachbarn in der Schillerstr. 1 sind Einbrecher. Können Sie da mal ganz schnell eine Streife hinschicken?
__label__de	Die ganze Wohnung war durchwühlt. Die Polizei kam schnell zu dem Schluss, dass hier Profis am Werk waren.
__label__de	Politik ist offenbar die Kunst des Machbaren und nicht des unbedingt Wünschbaren.
__label__de	Manche Menschen tun nichts - aber sie tun es auf eine faszinierende Weise.
__label__de	Die Natur verabscheut dumme Experimentierer.
__label__de	Schon als Kind war Tom ein regelrechter Satansbraten.
__label__de	Ich kann an den Problemen nicht einfach wortlos vorbeilaufen.
__label__de	Wir arbeiten auf der Schattenseite der Halle. Uns ist verdammt kalt.
__label__de	Menschen haben ein Gehirn, ein Herz und eine Seele. Das sind also keine Menschen.
__label__de	Kannst du bitte ordentlich Fremdsprachen lernen?
__label__de	Leben wir alle in einem gelben U-Boot?
__label__de	Sie hat genug durchgemacht.
__label__de	Der Februar ist der Monat der Liebenden.
__label__de	Ich ziehe einen sehr hässlichen, aber freundlichen Mann einem hübschen, aber unfreundlichen vor.
__label__de	Sie ist die Freude der ganzen Familie.
__label__de	Wir schwimmen zum Boot.
__label__de	Er schläft wie ein Engel.
__label__de	Sprechen alle Kanadier Französisch?
__label__de	So etwas war früher unvorstellbar.
__label__de	Tom ist auf einem Ohr völlig taub.
__label__de	Mary half ihrer Mutter das Abendessen zu kochen.
__label__de	Denkst du wirklich, dass ich das tun werde?
__label__de	Tom konnte dich nicht hören.
__label__de	Bist du sicher, dass du in Boston leben möchtest?
__label__de	Meine Freundin ist älter als ich.
__label__de	Sie haben im letzten Jahr ein Haus gekauft.
__label__de	Hör auf die Tür zuzuschlagen.
__label__de	Ich bin nicht ganz sicher, wo Tom und Mary wohnen.
__label__de	Er schmiert ihr ordentlich Honig ums Maul.
__label__de	Ein großes Auto braucht viel Sprit.
__label__de	Er ist ein Herumtreiber.
__label__de	Die Brücke ist auf der rechten Seite.
__label__de	Ihr Gepäck ist da!
__label__de	Ihr Reisegepäck ist dort!
__label__de	Der Körper, der Geist und die Seele müssen genährt werden; und zwar nicht mit Müll.
__label__de	Wie lange wollt ihr bleiben?
__label__de	Du musst es auch sehen.
__label__de	Das kyrillische Alphabet wurde auf der Grundlage des griechischen Alphabets erstellt.
__label__de	Yanni vergaß, Brot zu kaufen.
__label__de	Mein Papa ging Milch kaufen.
__label__de	Prescott Bush gewährte Deutschland während des Zweiten Weltkrieges einen Kredit, damit es Öl von Standard Oil kaufen konnte.
__label__de	Geschäftsbanken verleihen aus dem Nichts „gedrucktes“ Geld und nehmen wahres Geld zurück.
__label__de	Wie kommt es eigentlich, dass die Politiker bei dir in letzter Zeit so ihr Fett wegkriegen?
__label__de	Tom und Maria bekommen das Fernsehen intravenös zugeführt.
__label__de	Griechenland ist im Sommer voller Touristen.
__label__de	Fährt die U-Bahn zum Flughafen?
__label__de	Theoretisch dienen die Politiker den Menschen; praktisch herrschen sie über sie.
__label__de	Ich kann die Probleme nicht einfach wortlos übergehen.
__label__de	Kostenlose Kinder!
__label__de	Das Flugzeug flog über Athen.
__label__de	Zeig uns, was du zeichnest.
__label__de	Herzlichen Glückwunsch an Argentinien, das die Weltmeisterschaft 2022 gewonnen hat.
__label__de	Hat der Weihnachtsmann eine Frau?
__label__de	Haben Sie die Tür zugemacht?
__label__de	Haben Sie die Tür geschlossen?
__label__de	Das Abenteuer beginnt jetzt!
__label__de	Glauben Sie, dass die früheren Generationen besser gelebt haben?
__label__de	Wie heißt euer Lehrer?
__label__de	Glückwunsch an Argentinien zu seinem Sieg.
__label__de	Du bist ein Gewinner.
__label__de	Wie sagt man „bravo“ auf deutsch?
__label__de	Brauchen Sie mich noch? Dann gehe ich jetzt mal ins Bett.
__label__de	Es wäre nicht überflüssig!
__label__de	Sie vermisst ihren Ex.
__label__de	Sprechen Sie mit Ihrer Frau immer Griechisch?
__label__de	Wählen ist eine patriotische Pflicht.
__label__de	Dieses Jahr wird es auch keine weißen Weihnachten geben.
__label__de	Militärdienst ist auch eine patriotische Pflicht.
__label__de	Viele Motorradfahrer in Griechenland benutzen nicht immer einen Helm.
__label__de	Warum stellst du so dumme Fragen?
__label__de	Was hast du ihr versprochen?
__label__de	Was für ein Auto fährt er? Weißt du das nicht?
__label__de	Aber warum bist du denn hier?
__label__de	Was hast du dir zu Weihnachten gewünscht?
__label__de	Weißt du, warum der große Chef persönlich hierhergekommen ist?
__label__de	Ich habe dem Chef viel Geld gemacht.
__label__de	Er lächelte mich mit seinen drei Zähnen an.
__label__de	Wir haben uns gefallen.
__label__de	Habe ich vor dir Geheimnisse?
__label__de	Du kannst mir helfen, wenn du mich in Ruhe lässt.
__label__de	Ich denke, Sie wissen alle, warum wir jetzt hier sind.
__label__de	Ich musste lügen.
__label__de	Zieh ihr den Mantel an und setz ihr die Mütze auf!
__label__de	Nach seiner Stimme dachte ich, dass er jung sei.
__label__de	Sie ließ ihre Jacke an.
__label__de	Opa siezt Oma und umgekehrt.
__label__de	Oma siezt Opa und vice versa.
__label__de	Was ist los? Schmeckt es dir nicht?
__label__de	Was ist denn wieder los? Kannst du ohne mich nicht einmal atmen?
__label__de	Wenn ein Politiker nicht korrupt ist, dann ist er kein echter Politiker.
__label__de	Arbeiter erschaffen alles, Politiker eigentlich nichts; und trotzdem leben Arbeiter viel schlechter als Politiker.
__label__de	Die Namen sind alphabetisch aufgeführt.
__label__de	In der Zwischenzeit hätte ich gern ein Eis.
__label__de	Du isst das Gehirn eines Schweines und das eines Affen nicht?
__label__de	Wann wird der nächste Zug voraussichtlich eintreffen?
__label__de	Ich nehme es so, wie es ist.
__label__de	„Was du dir deinen Eltern gegenüber herausnimmst! Ich habe meinen Vater damals noch mit ‚Sie‘ angesprochen.“ – „Du kommst ja auch aus dem vorigen Jahrhundert.“
__label__de	„Aus Respekt einander gegenüber siezen sich meine Eltern.“ – „Die haben wohl zu viele Kostümfilme gesehen.“
__label__de	Du kannst mir helfen, indem du mich in Ruhe lässt.
__label__de	Ihr könnt mir helfen, indem ihr mich in Ruhe lasst.
__label__de	Sie können mir helfen, indem Sie mich in Ruhe lassen.
__label__de	Tom bohrte ein Loch in die Wand und traf ein Kabel.
__label__de	Na warte!
__label__de	Die erste Periode endete gestern.
__label__de	Als Kind hatte ich ein Puzzle.
__label__de	Ich wusste, dass das ohne Komma geschrieben wird!
__label__de	Bei Anna wird in der Küche nichts abgewogen. Es geht alles nach Gefühl und Erfahrung.
__label__de	Als Kind hatte ich ein Puzzle aus der DDR mit Bildern aus der bekannten sowjetischen Zeichentrickserie „Hase und Wolf“.
__label__de	Grüß sie von mir!
__label__de	Ich kaufe Ihnen eine Armbanduhr.
__label__de	Ich kaufe dir eine Armbanduhr.
__label__de	Ich kaufe dir eine Uhr.
__label__de	Ich wünsche, anonym zu bleiben.
__label__de	Jean schreibt besser als du.
__label__de	Jean schreibt schlecht.
__label__de	Das ähnelt eher einem Gemüsepüree denn einer Suppe.
__label__de	Im Kühlschrank ist noch Kürbissuppe.
__label__de	„Im Kühlschrank ist noch Kürbissuppe.“ – „Leider nicht mehr. Ich habe vorhin Tom dabei gesehen, wie er sie gegessen hat.“ – „Tom? Aber der hatte doch schon heute Mittag welche!“ – „Tja, du weißt doch, dass er immer hungrig wie ein Wolf ist.“ – „Und was machen wir jetzt mit dir? Komm, ich mach’ dir Bratkartoffeln!“
__label__de	Das steht in ihrem Buch.
__label__de	Das steht in seinem Buch.
__label__de	Das hatten wir gesagt.
__label__de	Ich werde wohl nicht länger warten.
__label__de	Ich werde wohl gehen.
__label__de	Wenn du willst, kannst du warten.
__label__de	Wenn ihr wollt, könnt ihr warten.
__label__de	Wenn Sie wollen, können Sie warten.
__label__de	Sie können hier auf sie warten.
__label__de	Ihr könnt hier auf sie warten.
__label__de	Du kannst hier auf sie warten.
__label__de	Tom hat sich vom Christkind eine Freundin gewünscht, und es fügte sich, dass Maria fragte, ob sie zu Weihnachten kommen könne, da sie es nicht allein verbringen wollte.
__label__de	Warum hat Maria Toms Geschenk nicht angenommen?
__label__de	Es gibt viele Gründe, Vegetarier zu werden.
__label__de	Uns ist der respektvolle Umgang mit allen Lebewesen wichtig.
__label__de	Zitat Ende. Die Zeile wiederholen.
__label__de	Das Buch wurde von der Kritik schon verrissen, bevor es überhaupt erschienen war.
__label__de	Ich habe dir vertraut, weil du mein Freund bist.
__label__de	Ich habe sie besucht, als ich in Griechenland war.
__label__de	Ich brauche kein Auto. Ich bin das Auto.
__label__de	Ich ging aus dem Haus und sah Tom mit seinem kleinen Hund Fido.
__label__de	Ganz normal ist hier keiner. Irgendeinen Dachschaden haben alle.
__label__de	Tom hat alle meine Fragen beantwortet.
__label__de	Wenn man sich hier erwischen lässt, wandert man ohne Wenn und Aber für drei Tage in den Bau.
__label__de	Wenn du willst, kannst du hier warten.
__label__de	Wenn ihr wollt, könnt ihr hier warten.
__label__de	Wenn Sie wollen, können Sie hier warten.
__label__de	Die meisten Studenten benutzen den Computer hauptsächlich zum Schreiben von Arbeiten.
__label__de	Es nutzt nichts, sich hiermit abzugeben.
__label__de	Es hat sich nicht gelohnt, sich hierüber den Kopf zerbrochen zu haben.
__label__de	Es lohnt sich nicht, sich darüber den Kopf zu zerbrechen.
__label__de	Umarmungen!
__label__de	Bring!
__label__de	Hol!
__label__de	Schwöre!
__label__de	Töte!
__label__de	Tom trommelte.
__label__de	Bravo, Tom!
__label__de	Hm.
__label__de	Alter, im Ernst.
__label__de	Alter, ernsthaft.
__label__de	So friedlich.
__label__de	Leck mich!
__label__de	Man muss sich einfach anpassen.
__label__de	Du muss dich einfach anpassen.
__label__de	Wir haben viel erreicht.
__label__de	Wurde Tom gefragt zu gehen?
__label__de	Tom würde sicher zustimmen.
__label__de	Tom hatte eine schnelle Antwort.
__label__de	Tom erstaunt mich manchmal.
__label__de	Tom stimmt zu, dass das wahr ist.
__label__de	Die kurze Antwort lautet nein.
__label__de	Die kurze Antwort ist nein.
__label__de	Gib mir einfach eine Antwort.
__label__de	Es ist zu schwer, um es zu bewegen.
__label__de	Das passt einfach nicht zusammen.
__label__de	Das geht einfach nicht auf.
__label__de	Schwimmen macht mir keinen Spaß.
__label__de	Ich schwimme nicht gerne.
__label__de	Ich habe Tom danach gefragt.
__label__de	Ich bewundere Tom zutiefst.
__label__de	Haben Sie die Antwort?
__label__de	Tom will sofort Antworten.
__label__de	Tom sieht aus wie ein Mädchen.
__label__de	Tom ist ein schneller Schwimmer.
__label__de	Drei Menschen überlebten.
__label__de	Drei Personen haben überlebt.
__label__de	Dem kann ich zustimmen.
__label__de	Fragen Sie einfach Tom danach.
__label__de	Dem muss ich zustimmen.
__label__de	Ich muss dem zustimmen.
__label__de	Es wird jede Menge Treibgut aus dem Wasser gefischt.
__label__de	Der Pegel steigt!
__label__de	Und hier kommen Sie ins Spiel.
__label__de	Hör auf herumzufuchteln!
__label__de	Alles ist bis ins kleinste Detail durchgeplant!
__label__de	Die Kleidung wurde nass.
__label__de	Tante Anna kommt über die Weihnachtsfeiertage zu uns. Sonst wäre sie ja allein bei sich zu Hause.
__label__de	Um den Glauben der Kinder an den Weihnachtsmann aufrechtzuerhalten, hat Peter geradezu eine Inszenierung durchgeführt.
__label__de	Nichts machen können wir am besten.
__label__de	Es wurde ihm verboten zu sprechen.
__label__de	Diese Schuhe wurden in Frankreich entworfen.
__label__de	Ich spreche so gut Französisch wie er.
__label__de	Ich spreche so gut Französisch wie du.
__label__de	Ich spreche so gut Französisch wie ihr.
__label__de	Ich spreche so gut Französisch wie Sie.
__label__de	Sie dachten daran, mir ein Geschenk zu machen, weil ich ihnen geholfen habe.
__label__de	Am besten übersetzt du aus einer Fremdsprache, die du kennst, in deine eigene Muttersprache.
__label__de	Ich bin mir sicher, Tom wird dein Geschenk lieben.
__label__de	Ich bin sicher, Tom wollte das nicht tun.
__label__de	Ich bin sicher, dass Tom das nicht beabsichtigt hat.
__label__de	Ich bin sicher, dass Tom nichts davon wusste.
__label__de	Ich bin mir sicher, das ist, was Tom wollen würde
__label__de	Ich bin sicher, dass Tom Mary nicht mag.
__label__de	Ich bin sicher, dass alles gut wird.
__label__de	Ich bin sicher, dass alles gut gehen wird.
__label__de	Ich bin sicher, es ist hier irgendwo.
__label__de	Ich bin sicher, dass es hier irgendwo ist.
__label__de	Ich bin sicher, dass ich es nicht war, der das gesagt hat.
__label__de	Ich bin sehr froh, dass es Tom besser geht.
__label__de	Ich versuche immer noch, das herauszufinden.
__label__de	Das versuche ich immer noch herauszufinden.
__label__de	Ich bleibe noch eine Weile hier.
__label__de	Ich bleibe für eine Weile hier.
__label__de	Es tut mir leid, da kann ich nichts machen.
__label__de	Es tut mir leid, ich weiß nicht, was ich sagen soll.
__label__de	Tom wurde von einem Auto angefahren, als er die Straße überquerte.
__label__de	Nichts ist verloren.
__label__de	Wir haben uns in den Straßen verirrt.
__label__de	Ich sprach, aber ich wurde nicht gehört.
__label__de	Ich habe mich verirrt, weil ich keine Karte hatte.
__label__de	Du bist kein Hund. Bist du eine Katze?
__label__de	Sie sind kein Hund. Sind Sie eine Katze?
__label__de	Das Reh ging in sein Haus, weil es draußen sehr kalt war.
__label__de	Die Schüler konnten nicht antworten.
__label__de	In der Geschichte geht es darum, dass sich einige Leute nehmen, was anderen gehört.
__label__de	Kriege sind in Ideologien gekleidete Räubereien.
__label__de	Es gibt die Geschichte und die Wahrheit.
__label__de	Die Politik ist die Geschichte der Gegenwart.
__label__de	Tom steht in Geschichtsbüchern.
__label__de	Ich habe mir zu Weihnachten nur Papa gewünscht.
__label__de	Dieses Medikament kann viel mehr schädliche Nebenwirkungen als positive Wirkungen haben.
__label__de	So bat er mich, es mal zu versuchen.
__label__de	Tom hat sein Hausarzt vorgeschlagen, dass er jeden Tag zwei Eimer Medikamente einnehme. Er nimmt sicherheitshalber aber drei Eimer davon.
__label__de	Ich frage mich, warum das Symbol der Apotheken eine Schlange ist.
__label__de	Tom liest die Nebenwirkungen immer noch.
__label__de	Gimpel sind, die anderen selbstlos helfen.
__label__de	„Hast du dir das Haar schneiden lassen?“ –„Nein, ich hab mir alle Haare schneiden lassen.“
__label__de	Pfizer-Impfstoffe haben eine Million aufgelistete potentielle Nebenwirkungen.
__label__de	Tom hat so viel getrunken, dass er mit dem Reden nicht aufhören kann.
__label__de	Tom wurde im Laufe seiner Folterung an einen Sessel gebunden und dazu gezwungen, sich Arzneimittelwerbungen anzuschauen.
__label__de	„Würdest du mich bitte ein Taxi rufen?“ – „OK. Du bist ein Taxi.“
__label__de	Zwei Tage vor Weihnachten gab es noch Schnee.
__label__de	Entschuldigung. Wie oft fahren die Shuttlebusse in die New Yorker Innenstadt?
__label__de	Es tut mir leid, das dürfen Sie nicht.
__label__de	Es tut mir leid, ich habe gerade alle Hände voll zu tun.
__label__de	Es tut mir leid, aber ich habe nicht verstanden, was Sie gesagt haben.
__label__de	Entschuldigung, könnten Sie das bitte wiederholen?
__label__de	Entschuldigung, ich wünschte du würdest es nicht tun.
__label__de	Es tut mir leid, wir können keine Flugänderungen für dieses Ticket vornehmen.
__label__de	Wer ist der Mann, der in der Ecke sitzt?
__label__de	Frau Smith war eine berühmte Schönheit.
__label__de	Frau Smith kann ihren Mann dazu bringen, alles zu tun, was sie will.
__label__de	Dr. Smith ist der sachkundigste Experte auf diesem Gebiet.
__label__de	Die verlorenen Kinder wurden gefunden.
__label__de	Herr Smith hielt eine Vorlesung über Literatur.
__label__de	Herr Smith hat vergessen, sein Pendlerticket mitzunehmen.
__label__de	Herr Smith verklagte sie auf Schadensersatz.
__label__de	Herr Smith wird des Vertragsbruchs beschuldigt.
__label__de	Herr Smith ist anfällig für diese Art von Kritik.
__label__de	Das Fachgebiet von Herrn Smith ist die Wirtschaft.
__label__de	Professor Smith gilt als einer der größten Gelehrten der englischen Philologie.
__label__de	Prof. Smith ist für seinen exzentrischen Lebensstil bekannt.
__label__de	Apropos Professor Smith, sein Assistent ist schwerhörig.
__label__de	Smith forderte die Zahlung.
__label__de	Smith verlangte die Bezahlung.
__label__de	Die Smiths sind unsere Cousins und Cousinen.
__label__de	Herr Smith ist noch nicht aufgetaucht, aber er versprochen hat, zu kommen.
__label__de	Herr Smith machte ihn zum Arzt.
__label__de	Herr Smith hat es sich zur Regel gemacht, jeden Morgen einen Spaziergang zu machen.
__label__de	Herr Smith sagt: "Ich bin in New York geboren."
__label__de	Herr Smith sagt: "Ich bin in New York geboren, aber meine Frau kommt aus San Francisco".
__label__de	Herr Smith hält sich für eine große Nummer.
__label__de	Herr Smith denkt, er sei ein großes Tier.
__label__de	Obwohl Herr Smith sehr wohlhabend war, war er ein Geizhals.
__label__de	Herr Smith sagt, er wurde in New York geboren, aber seine Frau stammt aus Japan.
__label__de	Herr Smith sagt, er sei in New York geboren, aber seine Frau stamme aus Japan.
__label__de	Verbinden Sie mich bitte mit Herrn Smith.
__label__de	Ich habe versucht, Herrn Smith anzurufen, aber die Leitung war besetzt.
__label__de	Apropos Smith: Was ist aus seiner Tochter geworden?
__label__de	Deine Hose reicht bis zum Boden.
__label__de	Schlechtes Sehvermögen ist ein Handicap für einen Sportler.
__label__de	Sport spielt eine wichtige Rolle im gesellschaftlichen Leben.
__label__de	Sie müssen eine Zeit lang auf Sport verzichten.
__label__de	Sie müssen den Sport für eine Weile aufgeben.
__label__de	Sport macht uns gesund, sowohl geistig als auch körperlich.
__label__de	Hast du Interesse an Sport?
__label__de	Interessierst du dich für Sport?
__label__de	Der Sprecher bestätigte, dass der Bericht wahr sei.
__label__de	Bist du dazu fähig?
__label__de	Sind Sie dazu in der Lage?
__label__de	Sind Sie dazu im Stande?
__label__de	Denkst du dieser Pulli ist etwas zu eng?
__label__de	Findest du, dass dieser Pullover ein bisschen zu eng ist?
__label__de	Ich war einmal mit Laura dort.
__label__de	Ich kann die Decke berühren.
__label__de	Tom sagt, dass er sich nicht sicher sei, ob Mary schwimmen kann.
__label__de	Ich bin derjenige, der ihn getroffen hat.
__label__de	Ich weiß, dass Tom das wahrscheinlich tun wird.
__label__de	Ich hoffe, Tom wurde nicht eifersüchtig.
__label__de	Er ist mein Idol.
__label__de	Er ist mein Vorbild.
__label__de	Ich weiß, Tom.
__label__de	Ich habe ihr eine Nachricht gesendet.
__label__de	Ich habe ihr eine Nachricht geschickt.
__label__de	Ich schwimme wirklich sehr gerne.
__label__de	Tom und Ich wurden Freunde, als wir beide in Australien lebten.
__label__de	Das Mädchen war verwirrt.
__label__de	Das Mädchen war verdutzt.
__label__de	Obwohl Tom Schmerzen hatte, gelang es ihm, zu lächeln.
__label__de	Die Eltern werden sehr glücklich sein.
__label__de	Natürlich ist das ein Scherz.
__label__de	Natürlich, das war nur ein Scherz.
__label__de	Vielleicht sollten Sie ihn einfach feuern.
__label__de	Ich habe Tom gesagt, dass ich das morgen machen werde.
__label__de	Sami muss das Bad putzen.
__label__de	Sami muss das Badezimmer sauber machen.
__label__de	Auf der Konferenz wurden viele interessante Dinge gesagt.
__label__de	Ich habe mich nicht sofort in sie verliebt.
__label__de	Haben Ihre Eltern Sie oft besucht, als Sie in Deutschland waren?
__label__de	Ich war ein Opfer der Liebe.
__label__de	Ich bin nicht so denkst wie du betrunken.
__label__de	Ich werde nicht oft wütend.
__label__de	Neben Griechisch würde ich gerne Russisch und Polnisch sprechen.
__label__de	Ich möchte, dass Sie meine Fragen beantworten.
__label__de	Ich glaube, das ist eigentlich gar nicht nötig.
__label__de	Wir mögen das auch.
__label__de	Wir mögen einander.
__label__de	Spielen Sie nicht mit Tom Poker.

__label__de	Yanni begann, den Körper anzunehmen, mit dem er geboren wurde
__label__de	Yanni beschloss, sich auf seine neue Karriere zu konzentrieren.
__label__de	Haben Sie Griechenland vermisst, als Sie nach Deutschland kamen?
__label__de	Man sollte meinen, ein allmächtiger Gott könnte ein bisschen Blasphemie schon vertragen.
__label__de	Ich wusste nicht, dass Hähne den ganzen Tag über krähen. Ich dachte, sie machten das nur in der Morgendämmerung.
__label__de	„Ich bin stolz, Amerikaner zu sein!“ – „Wieso solltest du auf etwas stolz sein, das du dir gar nicht selbst aussuchen konntest?“
__label__de	Ich wusste gar nicht mehr, dass Tom so groß ist.
__label__de	Ausgerechnet heute, wo wir’s eilig haben, ist Stau.
__label__de	Guten Tag, Herr Müller! Wenn Sie in die Stadt wollen, nehme ich Sie gern mit.
__label__de	Ich werde an der Kreuzung eine Pappel pflanzen.
__label__de	Was du vom Christkind kriegst?
__label__de	Einmal werden wir noch wach!
__label__de	Draußen ist es auch nicht kalt.
__label__de	Tom ist ein pathologischer Lügner.
__label__de	Nur eine Frau ist in der Lage, ein Kind in einen Mann und einen Mann in ein Kind zu verwandeln.
__label__de	Nun, übertreib nicht!
__label__de	Er erzwang die Sperre
__label__de	Diese Aufgabe werde ich erledigen.
__label__de	Ein afrikanisches Sprichwort sagt den Europäern: „Ihr habt die Uhr und wir haben die Zeit!“ Gut gemacht, Afrika!
__label__de	Eine Frau zu erziehen bedeutet, ein ganzes Dorf zu erziehen.
__label__de	Ich mag lange Röcke.
__label__de	"Wo leben Sie?" "Ich lebe in Brasilien."
__label__de	Wer stellt den Brief zu?
__label__de	Wer übergibt den Brief?
__label__de	Ich weiß nicht, ob ich jetzt Wut oder Traurigkeit verspüre.
__label__de	Hast du dich im Spiegel angeschaut?
__label__de	Haben Sie sich im Spiegel betrachtet?
__label__de	Der starke und kalte Nordwind hat den Weihnachtsmann samt Schlitten und Rentieren weggeweht.

__label__de	Fast sämtliche grundlegenden Dienstleistungen des Landes sind privatisiert worden.
__label__de	Sie war beim Friseur.
__label__de	Sie meidet ihn in letzter Zeit wie der Teufel das Weihwasser.
__label__de	Was ist denn los? Du wirkst traurig.
__label__de	Ich muss an diesem Wochenende auf Wohnungsjagd gehen.
__label__de	„Hast du die neue Single schon gehört?“ – „Ja, die ist nicht schlecht, oder?“

__label__de	Die U-Bahn fährt häufiger als der Bus.

__label__de	Diese Frage wirft weitere Fragen auf.
__label__de	Das hatten wir so nicht erwartet.
__label__de	Sie leiht sich ständig Geld.
__label__de	Beleidigt Sie das?

__label__de	Es fällt mir schwer, mich auf die Aufgabe zu konzentrieren.
__label__de	Laufen diese Woche irgendwelche guten Filme?
__label__de	Nachdem Tom die Bäume umgepflanzt hatte, bewässerte er sie.
__label__de	Das kommt jeden Abend um 20 Uhr.
__label__de	Es ist wieder so wie immer: Anna kommt, und alles muss sich um sie drehen. Du wirst sehen, dass sie wieder im Mittelpunkt stehen wird.
__label__de	„Ich glaube, ich fahre wieder.“ – „Was meinst du damit?“ – „Ich habe auf Peter keine Lust. Hätte ich gewusst, dass der hier ist, wäre ich gar nicht erst gekommen.“
__label__de	Zuerst kommt der Tom, dann die Kinder und dann ich, aber für mich interessiert sich niemand.
__label__de	„Mach nicht so ein Gesicht! Die Anna ist doch noch ein Kind.“ – „Ein schlecht erzogenes – so frech und undankbar. Bei uns zu Hause hätt’s da schon längst mal was hinter die Ohren gegeben.“ – „Na, die Zeiten sind, Gott sei Dank, vorbei.“
__label__de	„Welchen nehmen wir?“ – „Das ist mir Wurst. Ich bin gegen Christbäume.“ – „Hast du eine bessere Idee?“ – „Pfeif auf Weihnachten!“
__label__de	„In diesem Irrenhaus kann ja keine Weihnachtsstimmung entstehen! Ich fahr’ weg – zu Tom!“ – „Das wirst du schön bleibenlassen! Wenn du jetzt wegfährst, brauchst du nie mehr wiederzukommen!“
__label__de	Warum bin ich schuld daran, dass hier keine Weihnachtsstimmung aufkommt? Wer macht denn ständig Streit? Das bist doch du!
__label__de	Weißt du was? Du kannst mir in Zukunft mit deinem Weihnachten gestohlen bleiben! Ich mache diesen Stress nicht mehr mit!
__label__de	Entweder hörst du jetzt mit diesem verdammten Theater auf, oder ich fahre ins Büro und verbringe Heiligabend dort! Genug Arbeit hätte ich.
__label__de	Die Vorfreude ist die schönste Freude.
__label__de	Schadenfreude ist die schönste Freude.
__label__de	Das waren die letzten Weihnachten, die ich mit euch verbracht habe!

__label__de	Was machst du um deinen Lebensunterhalt zu verdienen?
__label__de	Er hat sich mit seiner Frau über die Kinder gestritten.

__label__de	Er ist nicht mehr so fit wie früher.
__label__de	Meine Meinung ist eine andere als die seine.
__label__de	Ich habe eine andere Meinung als er.
__label__de	Meine Meinung unterscheidet sich von seiner.
__label__de	Sie kam durch die Hintertür herein, um nicht gesehen zu werden.
__label__de	Jede Reise ist ein Abenteuer.
__label__de	Sie nahm wahllos ein Buch aus dem Regal.
__label__de	Er verwandelte ein Stück wüsten Bodens in einen schönen Garten.
__label__de	Im Südwesten ist heute schönes, trockenes Wetter.
__label__de	Es ist höchste Zeit, dass wir eine Entscheidung treffen!
__label__de	Es ist höchste Zeit, eine Entscheidung zu treffen!
__label__de	In der Innenstadt gibt es eine Umleitung um eine Baustelle herum.
__label__de	Können wir bitte Süßigkeiten einkaufen gehen?
__label__de	Komm bitte in einer halben Stunde zurück!
__label__de	Ich habe das Gefühl, dass der Tag nie genug Stunden hat, um mit allem fertig zu werden.
__label__de	Es gibt Berge rundherum.
__label__de	Statt des hässlichen Fremdworts „Minister“ sollte man das gute deutsche Wort „Diener“ wieder zu Ehren kommen lassen.
__label__de	Außer der Professur gibt es an der Uni leider kaum andere Karrieremöglichkeiten.
__label__de	Wie schwer ist das Chemiestudium auf einer Skala von 1 (einfach) bis 10 (abartig)?
__label__de	Wenn ihr euch nicht für ein Studium, sondern für eine Ausbildung in der Chemiebranche interessiert, dann habt ihr momentan sehr gute Chancen, denn Azubis werden, wie in so vielen anderen Bereichen auch, händeringend gesucht.
__label__de	Promovierte Chemiker gibt es auf dem Arbeitsmarkt genügend. Da gibt es keinen Fachkräftemangel.
__label__de	Wie wird die Befragung durchgeführt?
__label__de	Welche Fragen enthalten die Fragebogen?
__label__de	Wann werden die Ergebnisse veröffentlicht?
__label__de	Pass auf, wenn du mit meinem Mädchen sprichst!
__label__de	Alle unsere Versuche sind gescheitert.

__label__de	Was ist das für ein Objekt in deiner rechten Hand?
__label__de	Sie hat mir höflicherweise auf meinen Brief geantwirtet.
__label__de	Maria kann sich bei Tom alles erlauben.
__label__de	Ich weine jedes Mal, wenn ich Griechisch lerne.
__label__de	Wir saßen alle um den Tisch herum.
__label__de	Wir haben einander nicht erkannt.
__label__de	Halten Sie sich für einen ehrlichen Menschen?
__label__de	Ich half Maria bei ihren Hausaufgaben.
__label__de	Das werde ich noch weniger ertragen.
__label__de	Was für ein schreckliches Leben!
__label__de	Ich brauche etwas.

__label__de	Du müsstest es zugeben.
__label__de	Du mußtest es gestehen.
__label__de	Wo haben Sie das Messer gefunden?
__label__de	Mensch, wenn er nicht der Größte ist, ist sicherlich das gefährlichste der wilden Tiere. Er tötet zum Vergnügen des Tötens.
__label__de	Seit er eine Glatze hat, trägt er einen Bart.
__label__de	Hast du einen Mantel an?
__label__de	Das ist unser Brennholz für zwei Jahre.
__label__de	Sie hielt meine Hand, schaute mich sehr emotional an und sagte mir: "Ich werde dich vermissen."
__label__de	Wie viel länger wird man uns hier noch festhalten?
__label__de	Wie lange werden wir hier noch festgehalten?

__label__de	Ich denke, daß ich habe verstanden, warum Tom nie wirklich gut Französisch sprechen gelernt hat.
__label__de	Marys Eltern wollten, dass sie mehr lernt.
__label__de	Es gibt nichts Trügerischeres als eine offensichtliche Tatsache.

__label__de	Er bat mich, ihm das Geld schnell zurückzugeben.
__label__de	Es wird einige Zeit dauern, sich daran zu gewöhnen.
__label__de	Er verhielt sich wie ein Kind.
__label__de	Die Hoffnung ist, einen perfekten Plan auszutüfteln.

__label__de	Mein Haus ist vom Bahnhof aus leicht zu erreichen.
__label__de	Als Marisol die Küche sah, ging sie in die Luft.

__label__de	Sie ist nicht mehr die heitere Frau von einst.
__label__de	Ja, diese Straße meinte ich. Der Bahnhof ist in dieser Richtung.
__label__de	Ich kann genausogut ausgehen, ehe ich zu Hause bleibe.
__label__de	Mir ist jedes Buch recht, solange es unterhaltsam ist.
__label__de	Mir ist jedes Buch recht, solange es interessant ist.
__label__de	Welchem Eindringling können wir trauen, wenn wir uns selbst feind sind?
__label__de	Ich schütze mich selbst.
__label__de	Sie schwieg; sie wollte keine Schwierigkeiten bekommen.
__label__de	Ehrlich gesagt bin ich ein bisschen niedergeschlagen.
__label__de	Er hat den letzten Tropfen Wasser getrunken.
__label__de	Kannst du das bitte noch mal machen?
__label__de	Wenn der Fahrstuhl die obersten Stockwerke des Gebäudes erreicht, fängt die Deckenbeleuchtung an zu flackern.

__label__de	Das Gästehaus wird umgebaut.
__label__de	Hast du vergessen, was du versprochen hast?
__label__de	Sie ist deine Tante, oder?
__label__de	Man jagt dem Geld immer hinterher, aber man fängt es nicht.
__label__de	Der Zug wartet nicht.
__label__de	Praktisch handelt es sich um ein paar Leute.
__label__de	Wir sind viele, aber nur wenige sind aktiv.
__label__de	Plötzlich wurde mir alles klar.
__label__de	Machst du dir keine Sorgen?
__label__de	Das war keine Aufforderung, sondern nur ein Vorschlag.
__label__de	Du hast ein paar Eier!
__label__de	Die Monate kommen und gehen.
__label__de	Sieh mal in der Speisekammer nach, ob wir Konfitüre haben.
__label__de	Das Wetter ist nicht so, wie vorhergesagt wurde.
__label__de	Du hast mir eine gute Idee gegeben.
__label__de	Um diese Zeit öffnet das Theater gewöhnlich.
__label__de	Er hatte sie noch nie in Rennkleidung gesehen.
__label__de	Sie überquerte die Straße und ging in einen Zeitschriftenladen.
__label__de	Die Treppe ist am Ende des Flurs.
__label__de	Sie kamen und klopften an meine Tür – was eine Überraschung war –, um sich als Chris, Jocelyn und Robin vorzustellen.
__label__de	Er ist gerade erst abgefahren.
__label__de	„Ist der Bus schon weg?“ – „Er ist gerade erst abgefahren.“
__label__de	Die Technik durchdringt alle Aspekte der Gesellschaft.
__label__de	Der Verkehr auf der Ringstraße wird wegen Hochwassers umgeleitet.
__label__de	Sie hat mir etwas vorschnell geantwortet.
__label__de	Suche es nicht im Kühlschrank. Ich habe es gegessen.
__label__de	„Dieser Kuchen, den du gebacken hast, schmeckt nach mehr.“ – „Man tut, was man kann.“
__label__de	Was wirst du diesen Sommer sonst noch machen?
__label__de	Wir spielten im Zug Uno.
__label__de	Das ist keine gute Idee; das ist eine ausgezeichnete Idee!
__label__de	Warum seid ihr eigentlich gekommen?
__label__de	Wellen brechen über die Promenade.
__label__de	Die Regierung hat drei Tage der Staatstrauer angeordnet. Die Fahnen überall im Land wurden auf Halbmast gesetzt.
__label__de	Die Weizenfelder sind goldgelb, und der Himmel ist azurblau.
__label__de	Lass uns Telefonnummern tauschen.
__label__de	Lassen Sie uns Telefonnummern tauschen.
__label__de	Er ist heute Abend hier.

__label__de	Auf der anderen Seite des Flusses sahen wir ein schwaches Licht.
__label__de	Sie züchten Rinder und Pferde.
__label__de	Die haben Rinder und Pferde.
__label__de	Miyake-kun hat mir einiges gezeigt, als ich in Kurashiki war.
__label__de	Herr Miyake hat mir während meines Aufenthalts in Kurashiki etliche Örtlichkeiten gezeigt.
__label__de	Zeig uns noch mehr.
__label__de	Das Zentrum des Universums befindet sich an jedem Punkt im Universum.
__label__de	Diese Blumen sind natürlich.
__label__de	Diese beiden russischen Schwestern sind mit zwei polnischen Brüdern verheiratet.
__label__de	Hast du das Feuer gesehen?
__label__de	Haben Sie das Feuer gesehen?
__label__de	Du bist meine verbotene Frucht.
__label__de	Alles wird immer teurer, teurer, teurer.
__label__de	Ich bin alleinerziehende Mutter zweier wunderbarer Kinder.
__label__de	Obwohl Anna Vollzeit arbeitet, reicht das Geld oft nicht.
__label__de	Carsten will nicht in den Kindergarten, aber er muss, weil seine Mutter arbeiten geht.
__label__de	Anna hat zwei Kinder von zwei Männern, von denen sie beide verlassen hat. Unterhalt zahlt nur einer davon.
__label__de	Anna hat sieben Kinder, jedes von einem anderen Mann.
__label__de	Anna hat sieben Kinder, aber noch immer keinen Mann.
__label__de	Von Luft und Liebe kann man leider nicht leben. Irgendwoher muss das Geld ja kommen.
__label__de	Es ist nicht immer einfach, nein zu sagen.
__label__de	300 Euro im Monat verfahre ich an Sprit.
__label__de	Ihre größten Sorgen behält Anna meist für sich.
__label__de	Das Leben kann nicht ohne Arbeit funktionieren, denn nichts fällt vom Himmel.
__label__de	Es gibt Momente, wo ich am liebsten das Handtuch werfen würde, weil mir alles zuviel wird.
__label__de	„Wie viele von den Sachen, die jetzt hier liegen, hast du selber gekauft?“ – „Also, wenn wir jetzt mal die Röcke nehmen, so habe ich in der Tat keinen selber gekauft. Die habe ich alle geschenkt bekommen.“
__label__de	Anna ist arm, aber man sieht es ihr nicht an.
__label__de	Wenn es mir nicht gutgeht, kann es auch den Kindern nicht gutgehen.
__label__de	Eine gute Freundschaft macht für mich aus, dass ich mich nicht jeden Tag melden muss, aber, wenn etwas ist, auf denjenigen zählen kann.
__label__de	Ich wünsche Anna, dass sie einen Partner findet, der sie so liebt, wie sie ist.
__label__de	Wenn ich meine Ansprüche, was einen Partner betrifft, noch weiter herunterschraube, dann kann ich mir auch einen Kaktus ans Bett stellen.
__label__de	Anna will sich von nichts und niemandem abhängig machen: weder von einem Partner noch von staatlichen Leistungen.
__label__de	Warum freuen sich deine Kinder so über eine Kleinigkeit, während meine herumschreien, dass sie nicht noch mehr bekommen?
__label__de	Bald wird man vor Dunkelheit den Nebel nicht sehen.
__label__de	Ich wurde zwar zum Hochzeitsempfang, nicht aber zur Zeremonie eingeladen.
__label__de	Mein Großvater ist ein lebhafter und wohlgelaunter Mann.
__label__de	Der Kleiderschrank stand links neben der Tür.
__label__de	Ich konnte die Ampel kaum erkennen.
__label__de	Fast alle Busse sind leer.
__label__de	Ich habe so viel gefressen wie ein Schwein.
__label__de	Wenn du reich werden willst, stiehl viel.
__label__de	Ist Scrabble ein Gruppenspiel?
__label__de	Von wem hast du es erfahren?
__label__de	Wir haben nichts mehr gemeinsam!
__label__de	Dieses Land hat eine reiche Kultur.
__label__de	Ein Mitstudent hat damals sein Chemiestudium nach dem ersten Tag des ersten Semesters abgebrochen. Damit euch nicht das gleiche passiert, schaut euch dieses Video an!
__label__de	Da Tom einen Bleistift brauchte, lieh ich ihm meinen.
__label__de	Chemie ist Physik, und Physik ist angewandte Mathematik.
__label__de	Im Chemiestudium werden, anders als im Mathematikstudium, keine Beweise behandelt, sondern es wird noch richtig gerechnet.
__label__de	Dich suche ich.
__label__de	Als ich so alt war wie du, da habe ich schon gearbeitet.
__label__de	Ich muss gehen, obgleich es regnet.
__label__de	Ich hab’ da mal ’ne Frage.
__label__de	Es gibt eine dringende Nachricht für Sie.
__label__de	Mutigen Sprung gewagt; / nimmer gewinnt, wer zagt; / schnell ist das Wechselglück; / dein ist der Augenblick.
__label__de	Die Sonne scheint heute nicht.
__label__de	Er erschoss den Liebhaber seiner Frau.
__label__de	Seit Maria Selbstmord verübte, sieht man Tom kaum noch.
__label__de	Ein vernünftiger Mensch drängt sich ganz schlau in den Vordergrund und lässt sich selbst hochleben.
__label__de	Unser Planet ist wunderschön.
__label__de	Ich bin gekommen, weil ich es versprochen habe.
__label__de	Das Wetter beeinflusst meine Laune bedeutend.
__label__de	Hunde mögen den Herbst.
__label__de	Ich habe es gezählt. Passt.
__label__de	Ich habe finanzielle Probleme.
__label__de	Ich habe es doch versprochen.
__label__de	Zuerst muss ich in meinem Kopf Ordnung machen.
__label__de	Ich habe mein Auto gegen seins getauscht.
__label__de	Ich muss dir unbedingt etwas sagen.
__label__de	Die Wände sind kalt.
__label__de	Ich habe meine Frau im Kindergarten kennengelernt.
__label__de	Natürlich bin ich wütend!
__label__de	Und du, glaubst du mir?
__label__de	Sie glauben mir nicht! Sie glauben, dass ich verrückt bin!
__label__de	Behalte mich in Erinnerung.
__label__de	Womit erpresst er dich?
__label__de	Meine Eltern erpressen mich.
__label__de	He, du bist hier?
__label__de	Er weiß, was ihn erwartet.
__label__de	Diese verdammte Katze hat mich gekratzt.
__label__de	Ihre Argumente sind nichtig.
__label__de	Hallo, mein Freund! Wie geht es dir?
__label__de	Du widersprichst dir ständig.
__label__de	Ich liebe die Ruhe der Berge.
__label__de	Nicht schlafen!
__label__de	Tom hat die Sonne in einen Sack gesteckt.
__label__de	Beruhigen wir uns!
__label__de	Ermutigen Sie ihn!
__label__de	Die Politiker reden Unsinn.
__label__de	Ich sage euch meine Idee.
__label__de	Fragen Sie ihn!
__label__de	Lass uns abhauen!
__label__de	Sieh, wie er singt!
__label__de	Kocht ihr nicht zu Hause?
__label__de	Denk daran, dass ich eine Frau bin!
__label__de	Kochen ist eine Kunst.
__label__de	Damit bin ich durch.
__label__de	Ich habe wirklich genug davon.
__label__de	Ich habe die Nase voll!
__label__de	So ein Angebot lehnt man nicht ab!
__label__de	Seine Noten sind ausgezeichnet.
__label__de	Alle Galaxien im Universum waren grün, gelb und blau gefärbt, als Pelés Seele den Himmel erreichte.
__label__de	Gute Idee.
__label__de	Man muss mit den Hauptwörtern ihre Pluralform lernen.
__label__de	Wenn Sie mich anrühren, schreie ich.
__label__de	„Möchtest du diesen Apfel?“ – „Ja, gib ihn mir.“
__label__de	Sag was Schönes.
__label__de	„Sag was Schönes, Schatzi!“ – „Dodge Charger.“
__label__de	Wenn es Engel gibt, dann ist sie bestimmt einer.
__label__de	Es ist mir eingefallen, wie diese Frau geheißen hat.
__label__de	Dein Ex-Schwager steht hinter mir auf der Liste.
__label__de	Es war ein schwerer Satz.
__label__de	Sie hat uns gestern Abend chinesische Gerichte gekocht.
__label__de	Ich glaube, Tom könnte in Australien sein.
__label__de	Du fährst wie ein Idiot.
__label__de	Du fährst wie ein Vollidiot.
__label__de	Tom und ich werden das selbst tun.
__label__de	Tom und ich werden das alleine machen.
__label__de	Für den Eintritt ist ein gültiger Personalausweis erforderlich.
__label__de	Ziri rannte davon, bevor ihn jemand sehen konnte.
__label__de	Ziri rannte weg, bevor ihn jemand sehen konnte.
__label__de	Ziri lief weg, bevor ihn jemand sehen konnte.
__label__de	Er sagt, er schwimmt gerne mit ihr.
__label__de	Er sagt, er mag es mit ihr zu schwimmen.
__label__de	Er ist sehr stolz.
__label__de	Sami hat Layla so sehr vermisst.
__label__de	Ich bin noch nie verhaftet worden.
__label__de	Ich wurde noch nie verhaftet.
__label__de	Wann hat Tom diesen Tennisschläger gekauft?
__label__de	Giraffen müssen nur einmal alle paar Tage trinken.
__label__de	Macht er dieses Jahr den Abschluss?
__label__de	Ich durfte Tom nicht sagen, was vor sich ging.
__label__de	Ich durfte Tom nicht erzählen, was los war.
__label__de	Es kommt nicht nur darauf an, was man macht, sondern auch, wie man es macht.
__label__de	Es kommt nicht nur darauf an, was man tut, sondern auch, wie man es tut.
__label__de	Jetzt fällt mir kein besseres ein.
__label__de	Es gibt für alles einen Grund.
__label__de	Ich hoffe, du hast heute etwas Neues gelernt.
__label__de	Wer hat außer dir davon gewusst?
__label__de	Sie dürfen das essen.
__label__de	Wissen wir wenigstens, wer es verkauft hat?
__label__de	Wir wohnen in der Stadt.
__label__de	Wir vertrauen Tom nicht besonders.
__label__de	Wie viele Leute sind vor mir auf der Liste?
__label__de	Wir trauen Tom nicht besonders.
__label__de	Der König verwaltet nicht, er regiert nicht, er herrscht.
__label__de	Heute habe ich nicht geraucht.
__label__de	Tom hat den Zigarettenqualm fröhlich ausgeblasen.
__label__de	Seine Kleidung stinkt nach Zigaretten.
__label__de	Ich suche meine Schuhe.
__label__de	Ich habe in der Tat viel darüber nachgedacht, es hat aber nichts gebracht.
__label__de	Ich habe über uns beide nachgedacht.
__label__de	Beim Essen hörten wir seinen Geschichten zu, was ihm am vorigen Tag passiert war.
__label__de	Wenn er früher als ich einschläft, muss ich sein Schnarchen anhören.
__label__de	Das sind in der Wirklichkeit nicht nebeneinander; da gibt es zwischen ihnen einen Abstand von ungefähr zwei Kilometern.
__label__de	Bis zum Ende sind es noch zwei Wochen.
__label__de	Ich habe ihn mit leeren Händen angetroffen.
__label__de	Jetzt fällt mir keine bessere ein.
__label__de	Das Weltall dreht sich um eine riesige Katze.
__label__de	Ein Eimer und noch ein Eimer sind zwei Eimer.
__label__de	Er spricht fließend Italienisch, aber nicht richtig.
__label__de	Als er hierherkam, um zu arbeiten, war er nur siebzig Kilogramm schwer.
__label__de	Das ist wirklich billig.
__label__de	Ich bin ein kleines Füchslein, das menschliche Sprachen lernt. Ich will nur helfen.
__label__de	Ist der Kreislauf stabil?
__label__de	Besteht eine vitale Gefährdung?
__label__de	Muss die Neurologie verständigt werden?
__label__de	„Ich wollte schon als Kind immer nur Busfahrer werden“, erzählte Peter. „Für mich ist das keine Arbeit, sondern ein Hobby, für das ich Geld bekomme.“
__label__de	Ist der Patient ansprechbar?
__label__de	Ist der Patient orientiert?
__label__de	Welche Verletzungen liegen vor?
__label__de	Transfusionspflichtiger Blutverlust?
__label__de	Eine Freundin hat Tom zur Zeit nicht.
__label__de	Schädel-Hirn-Trauma?
__label__de	Kommen Sie mit oder ohne Notarzt?
__label__de	Ist der Chirurg schon informiert?
__label__de	Ist noch ein Bett auf der Intensivstation frei?
__label__de	Gibt es schon Informationen über den Patienten?
__label__de	Das tut ganz schön weh.
__label__de	Ich kann es noch ertragen.
__label__de	Ist gar nicht schlimm.
__label__de	Es ist schwer auszuhalten.

__label__de	Maria wurde hochemotional.
__label__de	Sie wäre sehr stolz auf dich gewesen.
__label__de	Sie wäre sehr stolz auf Sie gewesen.
__label__de	Sie wäre sehr stolz auf euch gewesen.
__label__de	Sein Gesichtsausdruck war ein Anblick für die Götter.
__label__de	Tom und Maria klatschten die Hände gegeneinander.
__label__de	Ich habe das Recht, es zu erfahren.
__label__de	Tom war der perfekte Ehemann.
__label__de	Such sie, denn sie hat ihn ermordet!
__label__de	Ich lächelte und winkte ihm zu.
__label__de	Er wischte ihr mit seinem Taschentuch die Tränen weg.
__label__de	Keiner der Jungen war je getaucht.

__label__de	Ich bin mir sicher, dass das passieren wird.
__label__de	Wir sind hier gestern Nacht angekommen.
__label__de	Wenn wir ihn finden wollen, müssen wir denken, wie er denkt.
__label__de	Ich habe nicht die geringste Ahnung, wovon du sprichst.
__label__de	Der Motor lässt sich sofort starten.
__label__de	Eintrittskarten sind am Abend der Aufführung gratis erhältlich, solange der Vorrat reicht.
__label__de	Erzählen Sie mir nichts.
__label__de	Ich war auf dem Weg nach unten.
__label__de	Tom muss allein arbeiten.
__label__de	Fessle sie!
__label__de	Was sollen wir bloß machen?
__label__de	Neandertaler sahen diesen Kometen zuletzt.
__label__de	Erzählen Sie von sich.
__label__de	Es wird immer lauter.
__label__de	Was liefern Sie?
__label__de	Könnten Sie mich auf den neuesten Stand der Dinge bringen?
__label__de	Dass er nicht wie du denkt, ist kein Grund, ihn zu beleidigen.

__label__de	Du weißt nicht, mit wem du es zu tun hast!
__label__de	Er hat es nicht einmal angerührt.
__label__de	Ich vermute, Sie irren sich.
__label__de	Die Wahrheit ist selten rein und nie einfach.
__label__de	Werden wir das jemals beenden?
__label__de	Ich glaube nicht, dass ich jemanden in Boston kenne.
__label__de	Warte da!
__label__de	Wartet da!

__label__de	Ich sah ihn im Dunkeln an.

__label__de	Er ist jung, unreif und unverantwortlich.
__label__de	Der Kaffee ist bitter, weil ich keinen Zucker hinein getan habe.
__label__de	Er hat den Boden so aufgewischt, dass er jetzt mehr klebt als vorher.
__label__de	Geduldige Menschen gewinnen immer.
__label__de	Eine fehlt.
__label__de	Ihr neues Buch ist wunderbar.
__label__de	Er ist so groß wie ich und etwa 30 kg schwerer.
__label__de	Wie stark war das Erdbeben?
__label__de	Warum er das Dorf verließ, wusste keiner.
__label__de	Sie versprach ihrer Patin, dass sie den Ball nicht vor Mitternacht verlassen würde.
__label__de	Ich habe rechtliche Bedenken hinsichtlich ihres Vorgehens.
__label__de	Es gibt kein perfektes Verbrechen.
__label__de	Bekannt sein ist nicht erblich.
__label__de	Lehrer müssen geduldig mit Kindern sein.
__label__de	Das ist eine Verallgemeinerung.
__label__de	Das ist zutiefst problematisch.

__label__de	Tom hat sich entschlossen zu bleiben.
__label__de	Wie kann ich mich schützen?
__label__de	Nur wenige Schüler verstanden die Aufgabe.
__label__de	Das ist zu kompliziert.
__label__de	Er isst in seinem Zimmer.
__label__de	Er war so dick wie ich.
__label__de	Er isst viel, ergo ist er dick.
__label__de	Nimm deine dreckigen Pfoten von mir!
__label__de	Der Mann trägt schmuddelige Kleidung.
__label__de	Wir schützen einander.
__label__de	Wir schützen uns.
__label__de	Ich sehe zuviel fern.
__label__de	Als Faustregel bei allen zur Zeit noch nicht vorhandenen Funktionen gilt, dass es entweder ein sehr weiter Weg bis zur Implementation ist oder überhaupt nie dazu kommt.

__label__de	Warst du in einer Kneipe?
__label__de	Die goldene Waage finden beim Übersetzen eines Gedichtes ist vielleicht der richtige Weg; aber Sätze mit einem Satz anderen übersetzen, damit sie dadurch lernen, ist nicht unbedingt wirksam.

__label__de	Was führt dich hierher?
__label__de	Was führt Sie hierher?
__label__de	Ja, ich hab's getan.
__label__de	Warum hast du's getan?
__label__de	Tom, bitte hör auf, saublöde Witze zu erzählen!
__label__de	„Wenn wir anfingen, diesen Netzplatz zu moderieren, so könnten durchaus auch deine aneckenden Beträge entfernt werden.“ – „Das wäre mir’s wert.“
__label__de	Die katholische Kirche ist unstrittig eine größere Gefahr für Kinder, als Transgeschlechtliche es sind.
__label__de	Ich bin die Summe meiner Erfahrungen.
__label__de	Seid ihr Bulgaren?
__label__de	Seid ihr Bulgarinnen?

__label__de	Nein, ich hab's nicht getan.
__label__de	Der Schmetterling schlägt mit den Flügeln.

__label__de	Mit 31 Jahren hat Michael Phelps eine weitere Goldmedaille gewonnen.
__label__de	Vor 50 Jahren verließen Astronauten zum erstenmal die unmittelbare Umgebung der Erde und erblickten unsere „blaue Murmel“ hinter sich.
__label__de	Tom umarmte Maria liebevoll.
__label__de	Das war einer der besten Filme, die sie je gesehen hatten.
__label__de	Ich habe Ihnen jetzt die gesamte Wahrheit gesagt, und wenn ich diese der Polizei vorenthielt, so lag das darin begründet, dass ich die Gefahr, in der sich mein lieber Freund befand, nicht erkannte.
__label__de	Tom wich Marias Blicken aus.
__label__de	Bethony stellt seine Brotlaibe aus 20 verschiedenen Sorten biologischen Getreides her.
__label__de	Man kann sich zwar in allen Raumrichtungen umherbewegen, nicht aber in der Zeit.
__label__de	Tom ist ein Diabolo-Künstler.
__label__de	Die restlichen Zutaten dazugeben und alles umrühren.
__label__de	Du kannst ihn selbst fragen, Maria, wenn du willst.
__label__de	Ich hatte ganz vergessen, wieviel Spaß Stepptanz macht.
__label__de	Tom und Maria schnitzten Kürbisse zurecht.
__label__de	Sonst haben Sie nichts zu sagen, Mr. Holmes, bevor wir gehen?
__label__de	Das entschuldigt nicht, was du getan hast!
__label__de	Tom tanzte unbeholfen.
__label__de	Wenn Mücken mit den Flügeln schlagen, entsteht dabei ein markantes Summen.

__label__de	Ich bewundere Toms Arbeitsmoral.
__label__de	Marijuana ist in Colorado jetzt legal.
__label__de	Diese Stadt ist von Mauern umgeben.
__label__de	Ich habe die gemocht, als sie noch nicht berühmt waren.
__label__de	Und da der König und die Königin ihr liebes Kind nun geküsst hatten, ohne es zu wecken, verließen sie das Schloss und sandten Befehl, dass sich diesem niemand zu nähern hatte.
__label__de	Im Garten wuchsen Zitronen- und Orangenbäume.
__label__de	Zitronen- und Orangenbäume wuchsen im Garten.
__label__de	Es macht mir großen Spaß, mich mit dir zu unterhalten.
__label__de	Maria brachte Tee und Früchtekuchen.
__label__de	Du schnallst nicht, was abgeht, oder?
__label__de	Das Leben lehrt uns nicht, stark zu sein, aber es zwingt uns dazu.
__label__de	Wann muss der Artikel eingereicht sein?
__label__de	Warum hat Tom Angst, es zu tun?
__label__de	Sie haben die Kinder amüsiert.

__label__de	Tom ist alles andere als dumm.
__label__de	Tom, du musst für deine Missetaten die Verantwortung übernehmen!
__label__de	Die Ungarn sind ein freiheitsliebendes Volk.
__label__de	Die Politiker können alles tun, sie werden nicht zur Verantwortung gezogen. Das ist doch Wahnsinn!
__label__de	Politiker sollten gezwungen werden, für ihre Fehlentscheidungen Verantwortung zu übernehmen.
__label__de	Wann ist die beste Zeit für die Asperlernte?
__label__de	Wie erkennt man, ob die Asperl schon reif sind?
__label__de	Woran erkennst du, dass deine Asperl reif sind?

__label__de	Ich trinke oft Cola.
__label__de	Ich habe Cola getrunken.
__label__de	Und wie komme ich dorthin?
__label__de	Ich glaube, das ist eine Eigentümlichkeit, die in Deutschland oft beobachtet wird: die Leute sind zerstritten, und dann muss bis zum Lebensende Streit bleiben. In Polen, wo meine Frau und ich eine Weile gelebt haben, ist das ganz anders: da sind die Literaten auch oft zerstritten; der eine hat etwas Schreckliches über den anderen geschrieben, und dann treffen die sich nach einem Jahr zufällig auf der Straße, und der eine sagt zum anderen: „Weißt du was? Es reicht! Lass uns einen Wodka trinken, und der Fall ist erledigt.“
__label__de	Es ist kein Glück, irgendwo ein Außenseiter zu sein.

__label__de	Tom scheint es zu gefallen, Mary zu ärgern.
__label__de	In Washington wusste niemand, was zu erwarten war.
__label__de	Tom hat mir gesagt, er dachte, dass Mary noch lebt.
__label__de	Tom wird falsch liegen.
__label__de	Tom wird sich irren.
__label__de	Warum weinst du dann?
__label__de	Schlafe etwas, dann geht es dir besser.
__label__de	Schlafen Sie etwas, dann geht es Ihnen besser.
__label__de	Wir sind nach Hause gegangen.
__label__de	Wir gingen nach Hause.
__label__de	Können wir uns nächstes Wochenende treffen?
__label__de	Ich habe meine Stimme nicht erhoben.

__label__de	Ich verstehe diesen Teil nicht.
__label__de	Willst du nicht, dass ich bleibe?
__label__de	Möchtest du nicht, dass ich bleibe?
__label__de	Ich kann nicht für sie sprechen.
__label__de	Ich habe das viele Jahre lang gemacht.
__label__de	Das habe ich viele Jahre lang getan.
__label__de	Sie war glücklich, weil sie die Prüfung bestanden hatte.
__label__de	Tom und Mary haben ihre Haare gefärbt.
__label__de	Tom und Mary haben sich die Haare gefärbt.

__label__de	Du hattest kein Recht, das Tom zu sagen.
__label__de	Du hattest kein Recht, Tom das zu sagen.
__label__de	Das kann nicht einfach jeder machen.
__label__de	Ich kann besser reden als schreiben.
__label__de	Wenn man nicht lesen und schreiben kann, muss man eben reden.
__label__de	Früher hatte Anna ganz lange Haare; heute trägt sie eine Kurzhaarfrisur.
__label__de	Ich finde, kurze Haare stehen Anna besser als lange.

__label__de	Ich mache das auf diese Art und Weise.
__label__de	Sie schreiben an ihren Schreibtischen.

__label__de	„Sag mal was auf Französisch!“ – „Was soll ich denn sagen?“ – „Ach, das weiß ich auch nicht. Irgendwas halt, egal, was!“ – „Bonjour. Merci. Da!“ – „Wie lahm ist denn das?“ – „Du hast doch ‚egal, was‘ gesagt!“

__label__de	Scheiß ich drauf.
__label__de	Niemand hat etwas davon.

__label__de	Warum kümmert die Leute das überhaupt?
__label__de	Du bist kein ernsthafter Mensch.
__label__de	Ich habe meine Impfung noch einmal auffrischen lassen.
__label__de	Hast du dir den Wecker aus irgendeinem bestimmten Grunde so früh gestellt?
__label__de	„Opa, erinnerst du dich noch an Tom Hansen?“ – „Sicher! Aber wie der hieß, das weiß ich nicht mehr.“
__label__de	Es ist so hell, dass ich die Augen nicht öffnen kann.

__label__de	Ich werde nicht hier sein, aber mein Geist wird bei euch sein!
__label__de	Es gibt eine Sache, die im Deutschen sehr schwer zu realisieren ist, wahnsinnig schwer – das können die wenigsten Leute: dass ein Mensch schreibt, wie ihm der Schnabel gewachsen ist.

__label__de	Tom interessiert sich nur für Fußball.
__label__de	Tom hat wie ein Löwe gekämpft.

__label__de	Wo ist unser Kind?
__label__de	Möchtest du die Wahrheit kennen?
__label__de	Bitte keine Maschinenübersetzungen benutzen!

__label__de	Es war sehr hart.
__label__de	Ich hoffe, Tom ist fertig.
__label__de	Ich mache das oft allein.
__label__de	Normalerweise mache ich das nach dem Abendessen.
__label__de	Das mache ich normalerweise nach dem Abendessen.
__label__de	Sie kaufte sich neue Kleidung.
__label__de	Sie hat sich neue Kleidung gekauft.
__label__de	Ich habe mehr als genug.
__label__de	Wir müssen sie retten.
__label__de	Tom findet, dass Mary das nicht tun sollte.
__label__de	Meine Tasse ist leer.
__label__de	Mein Becher ist leer.
__label__de	Viele Kanadier tun das.
__label__de	Dazu wäre ich nicht in der Lage gewesen.
__label__de	Das hätte ich nicht geschafft.
__label__de	Das wäre mir nicht möglich gewesen.

__label__de	Tom wurde gebeten, eine Power-Point-Präsentation zu erstellen.

__label__de	Es geht alles wieder von vorne los; dabei hatte ich gedacht, wir hätten das endlich hinter uns.
__label__de	Es passiert absolut gar nichts mehr, worüber man sich freuen könnte.
__label__de	Klagt nicht! Ihr wolltet es ja nicht anders! Auf Warnungen habt ihr, als noch Zeit war, nicht gehört!

__label__de	Wir beide haben nichts zu befürchten.
__label__de	Wir beide müssen vor nichts Angst haben.
__label__de	Wir beide müssen uns um nichts Sorgen machen.
__label__de	Hältst du mich für einen Narren?
__label__de	Lass uns zusammen spielen gehen.
__label__de	Lass uns spielen gehen!
__label__de	Dreh dich um! Ich muss mich umziehen.
__label__de	Es war eine wunderbare Reise.
__label__de	Heute esse ich nur Salat.
__label__de	Ich habe keine Alkoholprobleme.
__label__de	Was ist deine Meinung, Tom?
__label__de	Wie lautet der Titel des Kapitels?
__label__de	Ist es nicht offensichtlich, wer der Schuldige ist?
__label__de	Wenn es heute abend regnet, gehe ich nicht hinaus.
__label__de	Wenn es heute abend regnet, gehe ich nicht raus.
__label__de	Die Realität ist anders als der Traum.
__label__de	Sie lernt Ungarisch.
__label__de	Er lernt Ungarisch.
__label__de	Er verlangte, dass ich das Geld unverzüglich zurückgebe.
__label__de	Es war eine bemerkenswerte Reise.
__label__de	Nicht die Sprache ist vulgär, sondern die Leute.
__label__de	Es ist nicht die Sprache, die vulgär ist, sondern die Leute.
__label__de	Die Sprache ist nicht vulgär; es sind die Leute, die das sind.
__label__de	Die Temperaturen pendeln zur Zeit um den Gefrierpunkt.
__label__de	Ich habe Maria gesagt, wie stolz ich auf sie sei.
__label__de	„Willst du etwas zu essen haben?“ – „Ach nein, ich habe gerade gegessen.“
__label__de	Würde es dir etwas ausmachen, auf die Kinder aufzupassen, bis ich wieder da bin?
__label__de	Tom lernte in der Universitätsbibliothek.
__label__de	Dieses Puzzle ist mir zu schwer.
__label__de	Die Warteschlange war gewaltig und verlief schon ganz um den Wohnblock herum.
__label__de	Das war ihre Idee.
__label__de	Das Brot erzählte seine Lebensgeschichte.
__label__de	„Das war ihre Idee.“ – „Ja, aber du hast mitgemacht, und deswegen werdet ihr beide bestraft.“
__label__de	Er ist Sachkundelehrer.
__label__de	Tom kann gut Karten lesen.
__label__de	Henry ist der letzte der Baskervilles.
__label__de	Ich bin auf dem Weg nach Haus.
__label__de	Maria schüttelte vor Verzweiflung den Kopf.
__label__de	Sie hat einen langen und schwer auszusprechenden Namen.
__label__de	Der Schnee ist weich.
__label__de	Sie weiß es nicht.
__label__de	Komm doch nach der Schule mal vorbei!
__label__de	Denk ich an Deutschland am hellen Tag, dann trifft mich, fürchte ich, der Schlag!
__label__de	Tom hat einen kurzen und leicht auszusprechenden Namen.
__label__de	Tom ist Mitte Fünfzig.
__label__de	Tom ist eins mit der Natur.
__label__de	Ich war erschrocken, wie gutaussehend er war.
__label__de	Von deiner Unschuldsmiene lasse ich mich nicht täuschen.
__label__de	Maria hat zu Hause keine Hilfe.
__label__de	Der Politiker wurde vor laufender Kamera dabei erwischt, wie er eine Frau küsste, die aber nicht seine Ehefrau war.
__label__de	Wir müssen die Vergangenheit hinter uns lassen.
__label__de	Urbain Jean Joseph Le Verrier wurde im Jahre 1811 in Saint-Lô in Frankreich geboren.
__label__de	Ich kenne auf der Feier niemanden.
__label__de	Tom schwamm mit den Haien.
__label__de	Das wird jetzt etwas weh tun.
__label__de	Studenten können sich mit einem gültigen Reisepass ausweisen, aber wenn man den immer bei sich hat, besteht Gefahr, dass man ihn verliert oder dass er gestohlen wird, wodurch ausländischen Studenten erhebliche Probleme entstehen.
__label__de	Hast du diese Sendung gesehen?
__label__de	Habt ihr diese Sendung gesehen?
__label__de	Haben Sie diese Sendung gesehen?
__label__de	Tom konnte nicht aufhören, bei Tatoeba Sätze hinzuzufügen.
__label__de	Pflanzen machen glücklich.
__label__de	„Soccer“ nennen die Europäer „football“.
__label__de	Er machte so einen netten Eindruck.
__label__de	Heute ist Freitag, das heißt, ich muss morgen nicht für die Arbeit aufstehen.
__label__de	Ich bin schrecklich froh, dass du jetzt auf Green Gables lebst.
__label__de	Tatoeba war über Weihnachten geschlossen.
__label__de	Was hast du genau vor?
__label__de	Dieses Museum ist eines der größten Kunstmuseen der Welt.
__label__de	Maria sah nicht weg.
__label__de	Es gibt eine Möglichkeit.
__label__de	Als Diana zurückkam, hatte sie das Feuer angeheizt und den Tee aufgesetzt.
__label__de	Nichts kann ihn wieder lebendig machen.
__label__de	Es läuft nichts zwischen Tom und mir.
__label__de	Seine Abwesenheit war sonderbar und unerklärlich.
__label__de	Die Bäume waren voller Obst, die Felder satt an Getreide.
__label__de	Tom hat einen Intelligenztest gemacht.
__label__de	Tom aß sein Gemüse.
__label__de	Tom wurde in einer Vorlesung über Psychiatrie ca. 200 Medizinstudenten als Fall „vorgeführt“.
__label__de	Wir sind Hand in Hand gegangen.
__label__de	Heute morgen war es viel kühler als gestern morgen.
__label__de	Er saß in der Klasse ganz hinten.
__label__de	Er wollte seinen Kameraden nie helfen.
__label__de	Ich wusste bereits, dass sie sich verlobt hatte.
__label__de	Dieser Bleistift ist stumpf.
__label__de	Die Forelle schwamm flussaufwärts.
__label__de	Es kam mir so vor, als sei er der Begegnung mit mir ausgewichen.
__label__de	Aus den orangeroten Beeren der Eberesche kann Konfitüre gekocht werden.
__label__de	Emilie singt gerne Lieder nach.
__label__de	Sie griff nach ihrem Stift.
__label__de	Die Kinder fanden die Weihnachtsgeschenke versteckt unter dem Bett.
__label__de	Entschuldigen Sie. Wo ist die Herrentoilette?
__label__de	„Nein“, sagte Mr. Jordan.
__label__de	Tom und Maria haben sich im Waschsalon kennengelernt.
__label__de	Du fliegst morgen früh raus.
__label__de	Samstags nach dem Fußball haben wir immer Fischstäbchenbrote gegessen.
__label__de	Sollten wir uns nicht langsam auf den Patt machen?
__label__de	Wäre es nicht besser, wenn wir jetzt gingen?
__label__de	Die Schwerindustrie profitiert immer vom Krieg.
__label__de	Diese Krawatte steht ihm gut.
__label__de	Ich schenkte mir ein Glas Whisky ein.
__label__de	Er hat eine neue Kollegin. Sie heißt Claire.
__label__de	Er stattete mir einen Besuch ab.
__label__de	Wir vergleichen Japan oft mit Großbritannien.
__label__de	Sie presste die Lippen zusammen und gebot sich, nicht zu weinen.
__label__de	Sie schenkte ihren Gästen Tee ein.
__label__de	Das ist die Schule, auf der ich war.
__label__de	Anna war in der Schule in Russisch die Beste, sogar noch vor den Russen.
__label__de	Mein eigener Vater ist für mich wie ein Fremder, und ich bin wie eine Fremde für ihn.
__label__de	Tom wird uns fehlen.
__label__de	Der Satz ist so, wie er ist, in Ordnung.
__label__de	Die Affen sahen’s und machten’s nach.
__label__de	Jetzt ist alles wieder in Ordnung.
__label__de	Kann ich ihnen einen abnehmen?
__label__de	Sie ist gerade erst gegangen.
__label__de	Er weiß es nicht.
__label__de	Wir sahen ihn tanzen.
__label__de	Frierst du noch?
__label__de	Diabetisches Fußsyndrom neigt zu Rezidiven.
__label__de	Komm nach Haus!
__label__de	Komm, ich helf dir.
__label__de	Komm näher!
__label__de	Komm morgen!
__label__de	Komm morgen.
__label__de	Diesen Rechner hätte ich gern, aber der ist ja schweineteuer.
__label__de	Der Angeklagte erwies sich als unschuldig.
__label__de	Die Angeklagte erwies sich als unschuldig.
__label__de	Sie war erstaunt, dass du so gut Chinesisch sprachst.
__label__de	Sie war erstaunt, dass ihr so gut Chinesisch spracht.
__label__de	Sie war erstaunt, dass Sie so gut Chinesisch sprachen.
__label__de	An der Ampel gerade auf die andere Seite gehen!
__label__de	Manchmal höre ich Gerüchte über sie.
__label__de	Ich höre manchmal Gerüchte über sie.
__label__de	Du hast falsch gedacht.
__label__de	Komm, tanzen wir.
__label__de	Die Wunde muss mittels Naht oder Klammern verschlossen werden.
__label__de	Komm, lass uns tanzen!
__label__de	Bei der Erstversorgung einer blutenden Wunde geht es zunächst um die Blutstillung.
__label__de	Du bist gelaufen.
__label__de	Der zusätzliche Druck kann die Blutgefäße komprimieren.
__label__de	Sie müssen sofort einen Arzt rufen!
__label__de	Er ist zurück aus Kanada.
__label__de	Komm sofort mit!
__label__de	Jetzt geht und habt Spaß!
__label__de	Tom hat Namen genannt und sich viele Feinde gemacht.
__label__de	Komm her, aber sofort!
__label__de	Komm zurück, und zwar sofort!
__label__de	Komm zurück, aber sofort!
__label__de	Tom spielt am liebsten Blindekuh.
__label__de	Ich mag Brezel.
__label__de	Magst du Brezel?
__label__de	Komm langsam zum Ende. Mir knurrt schon der Magen.
__label__de	Das ist eine Brezel.
__label__de	Tom ist Brezelverkäufer.
__label__de	Das ist eine sehr hübsch ausgedachte Geschichte.
__label__de	Ich würde hier und heute allen deutschen Autoren der jüngeren Generation einen Ratschlag geben: Schreibt nicht über New York! Es ist sehr gefährlich, über New York zu schreiben: es entstehen lauter Klischees – immer.
__label__de	Obwohl Romeo fast zwanzig Jahre im Gefängnis saß, hielt Julia, eine schöne Frau, ihm die Treue.
__label__de	Mama steht morgens als erste auf.
__label__de	Anna hatte ein solches Vertrauen in ihren Mann, dass sie gar nicht auf die Idee kam, er könnte ihr untreu werden.
__label__de	Das ist eine Autorin, die manches nicht gut macht, aber sie ist dennoch eine gute Autorin.
__label__de	Romeo saß vor dem Bild Julias und phantasierte sich daran besoffen.
__label__de	Die Japaner unterscheiden sich in vielerlei Hinsicht von den Amerikanern.
__label__de	Die Japaner unterscheiden sich in vielem von den Amerikanern.
__label__de	Sie werden diesen Stift verwenden.
__label__de	Aus den orangeroten Vogelbeeren kann man Marmelade machen.
__label__de	Tom ist Autorennfahrer.
__label__de	Ich werde alles deiner Frau erzählen.
__label__de	Olga ist meine beste Freundin.
__label__de	Eva ist Piroschkas beste Freundin.
__label__de	Tom hat einen leicht auszusprechenden Namen.
__label__de	Ich will nicht mit dir Schluss machen.
__label__de	Wir müssen hart arbeiten, um erfolgreich zu sein.
__label__de	Alle denken, dass ich verrückt werde.
__label__de	Wir wissen, wer der wahre Schuldige ist.
__label__de	Wir kennen den wahren Schuldigen.
__label__de	Die Hoffnung ist das Letzte, was im Menschen stirbt.
__label__de	Menschen müssen bezahlen, auch wenn sie sterben.
__label__de	Politiker wollen uns ihre Meinung aufzwingen.
__label__de	Politiker interessiert nicht, was die Menschen wollen.
__label__de	Die Menschen werden auch dann noch zur Kasse gebeten, wenn sie sterben.
__label__de	Der Fuchs wird Hühner stehlen, auch wenn er weiß gestrichen wird.
__label__de	Gute Kommunikation macht gute Freunde.
__label__de	Die Thrombose ist ein Gefäßverschluss durch ein Blutgerinnsel.
__label__de	In der heutigen Welt sind diejenigen, die die Wahrheit sagen, verdächtig. Man weiß ja nicht, wer sie sind.
__label__de	Ich studiere Grammatik.
__label__de	Die Thrombose ist gefährlich, weil sich das Gerinnsel lösen und in andere Organe gespült werden kann.
__label__de	Hält das Eis?
__label__de	Ich habe den Text auf Seite neun gelesen.
__label__de	Das Eis war sehr dick.
__label__de	Toms Name ist leicht auszusprechen.
__label__de	Dieser Kommentar war nicht nötig.
__label__de	Am 20. Oktober ist etwas Wundervolles geschehen.
__label__de	Isaac Herschel legte allen sechsen seiner Kinder eine Ausbildung in Mathematik, Französisch und Musik nahe.
__label__de	Er ist sehr sonderbar.
__label__de	Chiasamen enthalten viel Omega-3-Fettsäuren.
__label__de	Es ist schon eine Weile her, seit ich das letztemal Nudeln gegessen habe.
__label__de	Nach einer Woche der Hamsterkäufe sind die Regale der städtischen Lebensmittelgeschäfte überwiegend leer.
__label__de	Ich habe dir ja gesagt, dass er dich leiden mag.
__label__de	Wenn man um nichts bittet, bekommt man auch nichts.
__label__de	Es ist besser, nicht zu regieren, als falsch zu regieren.
__label__de	Sie regieren uns durch Angst.
__label__de	Man muss hart arbeiten, um zu regieren.
__label__de	Ein jedes Volk hat das Recht, sich selbst zu regieren.
__label__de	Regieren ist nichts für einen kultivierten oder ehrenhaften Mann.
__label__de	Die Männer regieren die Welt und die Frauen ihre Männer.
__label__de	Mit vollem Magen kann man nicht fasten.
__label__de	Wie realistisch ist der Traum von den eigenen vier Wänden?`Müsste man dafür erst im Lotto gewinnen, oder reicht ein normales Gehalt?
__label__de	Diejenigen, die der Regierung oder im Allgemeinen den Politikern immer noch glauben, müssen im Kopf Sägespäne haben.
__label__de	„Joe Biden“ will einen Weltkrieg.
__label__de	Ursula von der Leyen wurde auf einem Bilderberg-Treffen zur Präsidentin Europas gewählt.
__label__de	Das Eis des Sees war zehn Zentimeter dick.
__label__de	So machen es die meisten.
__label__de	Die eigentlichen Kriegstreiber sind korrupte und mafiöse Regierungen und die mit ihnen verbandelte und von ihnen geförderte Waffenlobby.
__label__de	Am nächsten Tag sagte er ihr, dass er sie gern habe.
__label__de	Was glaubst du, wer’s getan hat?
__label__de	Was glaubt ihr, wer’s getan hat?
__label__de	Was glauben Sie, wer’s getan hat?
__label__de	Die Pest wird vorwiegend von Ratten übertragen.
__label__de	Ich weiß, dass das sehr beängstigend für dich sein muss.
__label__de	Ich weiß, dass das sehr beängstigend für euch sein muss.
__label__de	Ich weiß, dass das sehr beängstigend für Sie sein muss.
__label__de	Wenn man die Leiche im Keller schon nicht loswerden kann, sollte man sie das Tanzen lehren.
__label__de	Es ist fast unzerbrechlich.
__label__de	Das überrascht mich überhaupt nicht.
__label__de	Man sollte nicht heiraten.
__label__de	Du solltest nicht heiraten.
__label__de	Sie sollten nicht heiraten.
__label__de	Ihr solltet nicht heiraten.
__label__de	Sie legte sich die Hände auf die Hüfte.
__label__de	Ich schätze mich glücklich, sie zu haben.
__label__de	Das ist für Touristen.
__label__de	Übrigens bist du sehr attraktiv.
__label__de	Die EU wird ohne euch nicht mehr die gleiche sein.
__label__de	Ruf mich nicht auf der Arbeit an!
__label__de	Sie hat nicht die ganze Wahrheit gesagt.
__label__de	Toms Leben fing an auseinanderzufallen.
__label__de	Das Feuer ist heiß genug, um Gemüse zuzubereiten.
__label__de	Ich mache da keine Witze.
__label__de	Wie lange seid ihr beiden schon zusammen?
__label__de	Tom hat vergessen, die Milch in den Kühlschrank zurückzustellen.
__label__de	Tom vergaß, die Milch zurück in den Kühlschrank zu stellen.
__label__de	Trau ihm nicht! Er lügt immer. Er lügt bei allem.
__label__de	Ist deine Lieblingsfarbe Grau?
__label__de	Ist Grau deine Lieblingsfarbe?
__label__de	Es mangelt nicht an zu erledigenden Arbeiten.
__label__de	Vertrauen Sie auf Ihr Glück!
__label__de	Es wird keine Probleme geben.
__label__de	„Um wieviel Uhr verließ Mr. Drebber Ihr Haus, um zum Zug zu gehen?“ fragte ich.
__label__de	Vertrau auf dein Glück.
__label__de	Die Temperaturen in der Arktis steigen rapide.
__label__de	Tom und Maria klappten die Klappstühle zusammen.
__label__de	Hier wird es keine Probleme geben.
__label__de	Er kennt die Wahrheit nicht.
__label__de	Ich hoffe, dass es keine Probleme geben wird.
__label__de	Toms Telefonnummer ist nicht aufgeführt.
__label__de	Tom und Maria haben viele Enkelkinder.
__label__de	Mein Freund hat mir die Schnürsenkel zusammengebunden, und als ich aufstehen wollte, fiel ich hin.
__label__de	Sie fing an, sich mit den Fingern durchs Haar zu fahren.
__label__de	Na schön. Glaub doch, was du willst!
__label__de	Sie behielt Schwangerschaftsstreifen zurück.
__label__de	Youtuber und andere, die einen Kanal in den sozialen Medien eröffnen, schaffen, bearbeiten und veröffentlichen Inhalte mit dem Ziel, eine Gefolgschaft aufzubauen, damit Förderer dafür bezahlen, dass der eigene Name oder das Produkt im Wirkungsbereich des- oder derjenigen Erwähnung findet.
__label__de	Die Jugendkriminalität nimmt zu.
__label__de	Wir haben viel Zeit zusammen verbracht.
__label__de	Das Lager endet morgen.
__label__de	Diese beiden Teile passen zusammen.
__label__de	Ist das wirklich, was Tom gewollt hätte?
__label__de	Wer profitiert am meisten von diesem Krieg? Das ist eine Frage, die sich jeder stellen sollte.
__label__de	Du hast wohl zuviel Zeit.
__label__de	Ich weiß nicht, warum ich weine.
__label__de	Tom hat nichts für den Ruhestand gespart.
__label__de	„Liebe“ und „Hass“ sind Gegensätze.
__label__de	Einen Kopf haben diese Politiker anscheinend nur, dass es ihnen nicht in den Hals regnet oder dass sie das Stroh nicht in der Hand halten müssen.
__label__de	Krieg! Das ist eine zu wichtige Sache, um ihn den Militärs anzuvertrauen.
__label__de	Die Zeit der klugen, weitblickenden Politiker ist lange vorbei.
__label__de	Ich werde dir nicht wehtun.
__label__de	Krieg! Das ist eine viel zu ernste Sache, um ihn den Militärs anzuvertrauen.
__label__de	Ich kann nicht zwei Dinge gleichzeitig tun.
__label__de	Maria versteckte sich hinter ihrer großen Sonnenbrille.
__label__de	Dieser Film ist so langweilig.
__label__de	Er wusste nicht, dass sie ihn gerettet hatte.
__label__de	Ich könnte es dir beibringen, wenn du willst.
__label__de	Die Italiener sind sich darüber im klaren, dass das Virus noch nicht völlig besiegt ist.
__label__de	Hältst du das für mehr als einen Zufall?
__label__de	Denkst du, das ist mehr als ein Zufall?
__label__de	Ich glaube, wir kommen der Sache näher.
__label__de	Du bist der liebenswürdigste Mensch, dem ich je begegnet bin.
__label__de	Der Frosch ward wieder zu Vasilissa, der klugen Jungfrau.
__label__de	Wann wurde Ihre Frau geboren?
__label__de	Wann wurde deine Frau geboren?
__label__de	Tom beschloss, für die Liebe alles aufs Spiel zu setzen.
__label__de	Obwohl die COVID-Impfstoffe ein Licht am Ende des Tunnels sind, ist der Tunnel sehr lang.
__label__de	In zwei bis drei Stunden wirst du ein richtiger Esel sein, gerade so wie jene, welche die Obstkarren zum Markte ziehen.
__label__de	So reden die Ärzte immer, damit die Leute den Mut nicht verlieren. Ich würde mir an ihrer Stelle keine große Hoffnung machen.
__label__de	Es war schon ein Alptraum, nur getestet zu werden.
__label__de	Tom hat den Mont Blanc bestiegen.
__label__de	Tom begab sich auf eine Autoreise durch die Vereinigten Staaten.
__label__de	Er ist dumm wie Brot.
__label__de	Die Freiheitsstatue ist Ausdruck eines der ältesten Bündnisse der Vereinigten Staaten; das festigte sich 1778, als Frankreich die Revolution gegen Großbritannien unterstützte.
__label__de	Ich sehnte mich nach einer Tätigkeit.
__label__de	Maria wechselte Tom die Windel.
__label__de	Maria wechselte Toms Windel.
__label__de	Ich glaube, du vergisst da etwas.
__label__de	Du hast ja eiskalte Hände!
__label__de	Die russische Weltraumsonde Luna 3 sah im Jahre 1959 zum erstenmal die Kehrseite des Mondes.
__label__de	Sie sieht sich die Nachrichten im Fernsehen an.
__label__de	Alle flippten aus.
__label__de	Hast du überhaupt eine Vorstellung, wie sehr ich dich liebe?
__label__de	Sie errötete noch mehr.
__label__de	Das ist eine Einladung zum königlichen Ball.
__label__de	Warum gibt es soviel Hass auf der Welt?
__label__de	Im geheimen stimmte Tom Maria zu.
__label__de	Tom hat vergessen, für Maria ein Geschenk zu besorgen.
__label__de	Tom war emotional ausgelaugt.
__label__de	Greta Thunberg segelte über den Ozean.
__label__de	Vielleicht hätten wir eher daran denken müssen.
__label__de	„Ehrlich gesagt ist es schon verrückt“, sagt er.
__label__de	Wir gingen zurück zu mir und fingen dann an, zusammen Bilder auszumalen.
__label__de	Tom und Maria haben den gleichen Nachnamen.
__label__de	Wo kommen denn die ganzen Schrammen her?
__label__de	Der Schenk mischte die Getränke.
__label__de	„Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass ich die Stelle kriege, aber so kann’s kommen!“ sagte sie freudestrahlend.
__label__de	Mir ist nicht entgangen, wie ihr beiden euch anseht.
__label__de	Wie kommt das denn hierher?
__label__de	Soll ich mal vorbeikommen?
__label__de	Ich komme zu spät. Maria bringt mich um.
__label__de	Wie soll das Kind denn heißen?
__label__de	Früher war das einfach so.
__label__de	Hier will ich jetzt am allerwenigsten sein.
__label__de	Maria sah genauso aus wie auf ihrem Profilbild.
__label__de	Leute, die Kinder haben, sind glücklicher als solche ohne.
__label__de	Hat euch die Pizza geschmeckt, Tom und dir?
__label__de	Ich kann die Finger nicht bewegen.
__label__de	Tom ist ein verängstigter Mensch.
__label__de	Er ist ein gütiger und besonnener Mann.
__label__de	Das Wasser ist verseucht.
__label__de	Hör auf, Tom! Das ist nicht mehr lustig!
__label__de	Es war schwer, ihr Alter einzuschätzen.
__label__de	Wir leben heute besser als morgen.
__label__de	Ein glückliches Leben ist das hier nicht.
__label__de	Wir sind keine Kriegstreiber.
__label__de	„Warum hasst ihr mich?“, fragte Thomas Jackson seine Sklaven. „Ihr kriegt doch Essen und Unterkunft.“
__label__de	Mein Haar ist sehr spärlich.
__label__de	Mein Haar ist sehr schütter.
__label__de	Sie beschloss, nach Belgien zu ziehen.
__label__de	Senden Sie mir eine Nachricht.
__label__de	Schicke mir eine Nachricht.
__label__de	Englisch ist die internationale Sprache.
__label__de	Wir nutzen ständig das Internet.
__label__de	Wir nutzen das Internet die ganze Zeit über.
__label__de	Nicht nur du, auch ich bin schuld.
__label__de	He, du! Was machst du da in meinem Zimmer?
__label__de	Warum weigert sich die Türkei, den Völkermord an den Armeniern anzuerkennen?
__label__de	Tom sieht nichts wegen des Großbildfernsehers.
__label__de	Ich habe bisher drei europäische Länder besucht.
__label__de	Wahrscheinlich.
__label__de	Wahrscheinlich irrst du dich.
__label__de	Wahrscheinlich habt ihr euch geirrt.
__label__de	Wahrscheinlich habe ich mich geirrt.
__label__de	Ich bin auf der dritten Seite und dieses Buch hat mich schon gelangweilt.
__label__de	Mein Schatz, hör mir zu!
__label__de	Die Touristen haben das Haus des berühmten Malers besucht.
__label__de	Der junge Musiker hat nie daran gedacht, ins Sinfonieorchester einzusteigen.
__label__de	Tom hat mir gesagt, dass er im Ruhestand sei.
__label__de	Er spricht ununterbrochen.
__label__de	Er hat einige Freunde mehr als ich.
__label__de	Ich fürchte, ich habe dich beleidigt.
__label__de	„Danke.“ – „Bitte, gern geschehen.“
__label__de	Genau daran habe ich gedacht.
__label__de	Sie werden nicht ins Gefängnis gehen, wenn Sie uns sagen, wo sich Ihr Anführer versteckt hat.
__label__de	Spiel nicht dumm mit mir!
__label__de	Spiel mir nichts vor!
__label__de	Siobhan sitzt da und liest ein Buch. Die Tür geht auf, und Terry betritt japsend das Zimmer, so außer Atem, dass er beim Versuch, etwas zu sagen, kaum ein Wort hervorbringen kann, ehe er wieder nach Luft schnappen muss. Schließlich hebt Siobhan den Blick und nimmt Terry die Mühe ab, indem sie spricht. „Du bist gerannt“, sagt sie. – „Ja“, erwidert er keuchend.
__label__de	„Halt, wo willst du hin?“ – „Ein Ruf der Natur erging.“ – „Was?“ – „Ich muss aufs Klo!“
__label__de	Tom betrachtete die Schneeflocke durch das Mikroskop.
__label__de	Eine totale Sonnenfinsternis ist zu jedem gegebenen Zeitpunkt nur von einem ca. 150 km schmalen Streifen auf der Erdoberfläche aus zu beobachten.
__label__de	Das ist Toms Traumhaus.
__label__de	Tom bemühte sich um Freundschaften.
__label__de	Sie überlebte den Luftkrieg über England und zog dann nach Texas, wo sie im Jahre 1958 meinen persischen Vater kennenlernte.
__label__de	Tom aß trockene Rāmen-Nudeln.
__label__de	In Spanien isst man spät.
__label__de	In Spanien isst man zu später Stunde.
__label__de	Ich bin ein Mensch und kein QR-Code.
__label__de	Das ist alles verrückt.
__label__de	Was für Bücher liest du?
__label__de	Halt, wo willst du hin?
__label__de	Tom hat es ernsthaft in Erwägung gezogen.
__label__de	Vielleicht hat sie dich nicht gehört.
__label__de	Vielleicht hat sie euch nicht gehört.
__label__de	Vielleicht hat sie Sie nicht gehört.
__label__de	Manchmal machst du mir Angst.
__label__de	Tom hat seine Internetverbindung verloren.
__label__de	Das war einer der besten Tage meines Lebens.
__label__de	Er versuchte, nicht darüber nachzudenken, was er gerade getan hatte.
__label__de	Ich bin mir nicht sicher, ob ich ihm trauen kann.
__label__de	Worüber hast du mit Tom gelacht?
__label__de	Halt an, wo läufst du hin, der Himmel ist in dir: Suchst du Gott anderswo, du fehlst ihn für und für.
__label__de	Maria kleidete sich konservativ.
__label__de	Die haben zwei tolle Kinder.
__label__de	Tom hatte schon oft mit Delphinen Wellen geritten.
__label__de	O Mutter, hilf! Ich sterbe!
__label__de	Vermeiden Sie es, Augen, Nase und Mund zu berühren.
__label__de	Vermeidet es, Augen, Nase und Mund zu berühren.
__label__de	Vermeide es, Augen, Nase und Mund zu berühren.
__label__de	Man vermeide es, Augen, Nase und Mund zu berühren.
__label__de	Maria ist eine Sünderin.
__label__de	Ich denke schon sehr lange darüber nach.
__label__de	Apple ist eines der größten Unternehmen der USA.
__label__de	Das ist schön gemacht.
__label__de	Willst du deinen Freund wirklich eifersüchtig machen?
__label__de	Damals war sie unverheiratet.
__label__de	Ein paarmal in der Woche nimmt sich Marney die Zeit, auf den Bürgersteigen der Stadt nach weggeworfenen Gegenständen zu suchen und sich zu überlegen, ob sie diese irgendeinem Nutzen zuführen kann.
__label__de	Schalten Sie Ihr Mobiltelefon aus.
__label__de	Schalte dein Mobiltelefon aus.
__label__de	Sein Tod wurde zum Mord erklärt.
__label__de	Ich bin mir nicht allzusicher, was ich tun soll.
__label__de	Wir haben uns gerade über den Fall unterhalten, als Sie hereinkamen, Herr Inspektor. Vielleicht können Sie uns einige Einzelheiten mitteilen.
__label__de	Lebensmittel sind nicht das einzige, was die Leute in Kalifornien horten: Warteschlangen gibt es auch vor einigen Waffengeschäften.
__label__de	Herzlichen Glückwunsch, alle miteinander! Wir haben es endlich geschafft!
__label__de	Was hast du mit all dem vor?
__label__de	In Kanada lebt jeder Siebte in Armut.
__label__de	Maria kam auf eine Idee.
__label__de	Alle lachen über uns.
__label__de	He, wo willst du hin?
__label__de	Mein Vater kam nie vor 9 oder 10 nach Hause.
__label__de	Wenn die Zukunft ohne Hoffnung ist, nimmt die Gegenwart eine abscheuliche Bitterkeit an.
__label__de	In Spanien essen die Leute sehr spät.
__label__de	Woher kommst du und wohin gehst du?
__label__de	Wem nützt dieser Krieg?
__label__de	Lass mich dich umarmen.
__label__de	Gehst du nach Boston?
__label__de	Warum gehst du nicht nach New York?
__label__de	Es tut mir leid, und das sollst du wissen.
__label__de	Bei einem Verkehrsunfall sind zwei Menschen ums Leben gekommen.
__label__de	Wir werden bald anfangen.
__label__de	Gott lügt nicht.
__label__de	Er gibt nicht zu, dass er schuldig ist.
__label__de	Das ist nicht von Bedeutung.
__label__de	Ist mir egal.
__label__de	Nein, das spielt keine Rolle.
__label__de	Das ist jetzt egal.
__label__de	Ich habe ihr mein ganzes Herz geschenkt.
__label__de	Tom ist sein Liebhaber.
__label__de	Dicke sind kuschelig.
__label__de	Mit meinem Teleskop kann ich Jupiter und sechs seiner Monde sehen.

__label__de	Kein „Hallo!“ und kein „Auf Wiedersehen!“ – was ist mit den Leuten heutzutage los?
__label__de	Tom entging auf der Realschule den Zuwendungen der Raufbolde, weil er gut Fußball spielen konnte.

__label__de	Früher haben die in London gewohnt, aber inzwischen sind sie aus der Stadt weggezogen.
__label__de	Ich habe dem Kind die Windel gewechselt.
__label__de	Sie begrüßte mich mit einem strahlenden Lächeln.
__label__de	Das wird mir doch erlaubt sein?
__label__de	Tom schwor sich, nie mehr einen Fuß dahin zu setzen.
__label__de	Ist es erlaubt?
__label__de	Wir haben jene Mannschaft 2 : 0 geschlagen.
__label__de	Ich hoffe, dich eines Tages wiederzusehen.
__label__de	Ich hoffe, euch eines Tages wiederzusehen.
__label__de	Ich hoffe, Sie eines Tages wiederzusehen.

__label__de	Mary fühlte sich unwohl.
__label__de	Mary fühlte sich ungemütlich.
__label__de	Das ist jetzt sehr wichtig.
__label__de	Was hat dich gepackt?
__label__de	Eine wichtige mit Hilfe eines Parameterintegrals definierte Funktion ist die Eulersche Gammafunktion.
__label__de	Da ist ein Gasleck.
__label__de	Es gibt ein Gasaustritt.
__label__de	Tom fühlte sich als drittes Rad am Wagen.
__label__de	Das kann nicht jeder.
__label__de	Das können nicht viele.
__label__de	Selbst Tom kann das nicht.
__label__de	Tom ist ein bisschen verschroben, aber doch ein guter Kerl.
__label__de	Alles saubermachen!
__label__de	Ich verspreche, nie wieder zu gähnen.
__label__de	Seine Romane wurden auch in französischer Sprache herausgebracht.
__label__de	Sie bewundert diese Schriftstellerin.
__label__de	Sie bewundert diesen Schriftsteller.
__label__de	Bei uns in der Familie sind alle Frühaufsteher.

__label__de	Seid ihr weit weg?
__label__de	Unser Landeshauptmann ist streng, aber gerecht.
__label__de	Ich werde Apfelsinen essen.
__label__de	Ich werde Orangen essen.
__label__de	Du kennst die bestimmt.
__label__de	Ich bin nicht Französin, sondern Niederländerin.
__label__de	Ich weiß, dass Tom keinen Spinat mag.
__label__de	Warum mögen so viele Kinder keinen Spinat?
__label__de	Mochtest du als Kind Spinat?
__label__de	Es ist schwer, ihn zu überrumpeln.
__label__de	Es ist schwer, ihn unvorbereitet zu erwischen.
__label__de	Mochtet ihr als Kind Spinat?
__label__de	Mochten Sie als Kind Spinat?
__label__de	Ich war als Kind die einzige in meinem Freundeskreis, die Spinat mochte, ja sogar als Leibgericht.
__label__de	„Von meinen Freunden mochte keiner Spinat, aber alle mochten Spaghetti.“ – „Und wie sah es mit Spaghetti mit Spinat aus?“ – „So was kannte man damals nicht. Spaghetti gab es nur mit Tomatensauce.“
__label__de	„Studiert deine Tochter noch Mathematik?“ – „Nein, inzwischen hat sie ihren Abschluss und ist bei einer Bank angestellt.“

Diese Loyalität wird auch durch das Super-Mario-Narrativ unterstützt, in dem ein König Koopa diese auch durch biotechnische Manipulation sichert.

__label__de	Anna könnte, wenn sie das wollte, leicht irgendwelche Männer um den Finger wickeln, die ihr ein luxuriöses Leben finanzieren würden, aber sie will sich von niemandem abhängig machen, ganz besonders nicht von irgendeinem Typen und dessen Ansprüchen, sondern sie will selbst genug Geld verdienen und völlig selbständig sein.
__label__de	Dieser Beziehungskram ist mir zu anstrengend. Die Typen sollen mich in Ruhe lassen!
__label__de	Ich will keine Beziehung. Ich bin ohne glücklich und zufrieden.
__label__de	Eine Beziehung ist zur Zeit das letzte, was ich brauchen kann.
__label__de	„Der Anton ist total in dich verliebt.“ – „Der soll sich eine andere suchen. Ich habe auf diesen Mist keine Lust.“

__label__de	64 km sind eine gute Entfernung.
__label__de	Die Diät ist schwierig.
__label__de	Das Virus gelangte über die Nase in den Körper.

__label__de	In diesem Spiel gibt es keine Verbündeten, sondern nur Feinde.
__label__de	Jeder Staat hat eine Regierung.

__label__de	Was glaubst du, wer gewonnen hat?
__label__de	Was glaubt ihr, wer gewonnen hat?

__label__de	Hier wurde mein Vater geboren.
__label__de	Das zweite Album „Rio“ von Duran Duran kam 1982 heraus.
__label__de	Ich habe etwas von ihm.
__label__de	Wer ruft dich denn da?
__label__de	Ich rufe dich heute im Laufe des Tages an.
__label__de	Bist du damit zufrieden, was aus dir geworden ist?
__label__de	Die Ergebnisse, die er erhielt, sind im großen und ganzen zufriedenstellend.
__label__de	Die Regierung hat eine Entscheidung getroffen, die dem Staat hilft.
__label__de	Der Präsident der Republik billigte das neue Gesetz.
__label__de	Ich bin dein Verbündeter, vertrau mir.
__label__de	Ich bin Ihr Verbündeter, vertrauen Sie mir.
__label__de	Ich bin euer Verbündeter, vertraut mir.
__label__de	Die Amerikaner mögen’s süß.
__label__de	Du solltest den Teig ausrollen und nicht töten!
__label__de	Ihr wart von Anfang an parteiisch! Wenn die „Weltmetropole New York“ gegen das „verschlafene deutsche Städtchen Quedlinburg“ antritt, ist doch klar, wer am Ende gewinnt!

__label__de	Oligarchie bedeutet "Regierung durch wenige".
__label__de	Oligarchie bedeutet „Herrschaft der Wenigen“.
__label__de	Jetzt ist nicht die Zeit für Halbheiten.
__label__de	Ja, hier riecht es nach Gas.
__label__de	Warum tust du mir so weh?
__label__de	Warum lässt du mich so leiden?
__label__de	Doch es ist so.
__label__de	Ich werde es dieses Mal noch durchgehen lassen.
__label__de	Dieses Mal lass ich es noch durchgehen.
__label__de	Ich schreibe meiner Frau einen Brief.
__label__de	Ich schreibe meiner Freundin einen Brief.
__label__de	Ich habe nicht einmal eine Stimme bekommen.
__label__de	Wie lautete die Entscheidung des Gerichts?
__label__de	Gestern Abend habe ich einen Brief geschrieben.
__label__de	Ist er ein Freund?
__label__de	Anna redet nicht lang, sondern handelt.
__label__de	Ich denke oft an Geister.
__label__de	Ja, hier gibt es Gasgeruch.
__label__de	Wenn du mich nicht leiden kannst, dann lass mich doch in Ruhe!
__label__de	Ich dusche beinahe jeden Tag.
__label__de	Tom entschuldigte sich immer wieder bei Maria, aber sie wollte seine Entschuldigung nicht annehmen.
__label__de	„Hat sich Anton schon bei dir gemeldet?“ – „Bisher noch nicht.“ – „Vielleicht solltest du ihm noch mal eine Nachricht schreiben.“
__label__de	Das Christentum ist eine Offenbarungsreligion, das heißt, der erste Schritt wird nicht aus Vernunft getan, sondern ist ein Sprung des Glaubens.
__label__de	Die Christen wurden zunächst verfolgt, und zwar von Heiden.
__label__de	Tacitus kolportiert, dass die Christen kannibalistische Feste feiern. Wenn sie herumlaufen und von sich behaupten, Fleisch und Blut Christi zu sich zu nehmen, kommt ein Heide natürlich auf dumme Gedanken.
__label__de	Der Versuch, das Griechentum aus dem Christentum zu entfernen, ist wie das Schälen einer Zwiebel: man zieht noch eine Schicht und noch eine Schicht ab, und bald hat man nur noch den Geruch an den Fingern.
__label__de	Das Christentum war zunächst eine tolerierte und dann, 50 Jahre später, eine Staatsreligion.
__label__de	Die Königin ist in ihrem Schloss.
__label__de	Augustinus, der große Ahnvater der westlichen Kirche, behandelte in „De doctrina christiana“ an der Wende zum 5.

__label__de	Die Straße zwischen der Stadt und dem Dorf ist wegen Straßenbauarbeiten gesperrt.
__label__de	Ich werde versuchen, mich deutlicher auszudrücken.
__label__de	Ich werde versuchen, deutlicher zu sein.
__label__de	Sie durchstöbert in Musikläden gerne Kisten mit Schallplatten.
__label__de	Der rote Gürtel betont ihr schwarzes Kleid.
__label__de	Er hat sich diesbezüglich nicht geäußert.
__label__de	Der Schlüsseldienst hat die Tür wieder instand gesetzt.
__label__de	Ich habe mich gefreut, dass ich helfen konnte.
__label__de	Ich bin zum Obdachlosen geworden.
__label__de	Was hast du für ein Auto?
__label__de	Sie isst nicht viel.
__label__de	Warum kannst du am Samstag nicht kommen?
__label__de	Warum könnt ihr am Samstag nicht kommen?
__label__de	Warum können Sie am Samstag nicht kommen?
__label__de	Er geht gern auf dem Land spazieren.
__label__de	Die Dinge sind für niemanden leicht.
__label__de	Wir müssen die Dinge so sehen, wie sie sind.
__label__de	Man muss die Dinge so sehen, wie sie sind.
__label__de	Sie braucht eine Einzimmerwohnung.
__label__de	Sie konnte sich den Reißverschluss des Kleides nicht zuziehen.

__label__de	Ich habe dich mit deinem älteren Bruder verwechselt.
__label__de	Ich habe Sie mit Ihrem älteren Bruder verwechselt.
__label__de	Solange der Champagner fließt, ist Tom zufrieden.
__label__de	Sein kühnes Vorhaben führte zu vielen Kontroversen.
__label__de	Wir wissen beide, dass das, was Tom getan hat, falsch war.
__label__de	Mit diesen Worten ging er hinaus.

__label__de	Vielleicht könnte ich anschließend bei euch vorbeikommen?
__label__de	Vielleicht könnte ich anschließend bei Ihnen vorbeikommen?
__label__de	Der Wind ist veränderlich.
__label__de	Das Konzert findet jedes Jahr in Lyon statt.
__label__de	Dahin fahren keine Züge.

__label__de	Wir wurden nie hungrig.
__label__de	Bei den gesprochenen Passagen des Titels hört man ihren Mackem-Einschlag.
__label__de	Ich esse Pommes frites am liebsten mit Salz und Essig.
__label__de	Ich fahre diesen Sommer nach Irland.
__label__de	Sie ist auf eine Tasse Tee, eine Scheibe Röstbrot und einen Plausch auf den Markt am frühen Morgen gegangen.
__label__de	Erzähle ihnen von deinen Ferien!
__label__de	Es ist ein zugiges Haus.
__label__de	Sie ist gelaufen.
__label__de	Sie wiederholte ebenjene Worte, die ich am Tage zuvor zu ihr gesprochen hatte.
__label__de	Beim Schreiben hat er immer ein Wlrterbuch zur Hand.

__label__de	Ich habe dieses Wort nicht verstanden.
__label__de	Ich habe dieses Wort nirgends gefunden.

__label__de	Sie gab jedem Kind zwei Äpfel.
__label__de	Tom sagt, dass jeder, den er kenne, das tue.
__label__de	Er erfreut sich der Gunst der Mädchen.
__label__de	Wenn das herauskommt, sind die Tage, an denen wir uns der Gunst der Kaisers erfreuten, gezählt.
__label__de	Ich gehe ins Bett, da ich müde bin.
__label__de	Tom sagt, dass das alle seine Bekannten so machen.
__label__de	Ich denke nicht, dass Tom und Maria geschieden sind.
__label__de	Die sind schon immer so gewesen.
__label__de	Ich muss rauskriegen, wie das geht.
__label__de	War er schon immer so?
__label__de	Sie war nicht immer so.
__label__de	Ich schickte ihn aus dem Zimmer.
__label__de	Er war nicht immer so.
__label__de	War sie schon immer so?
__label__de	Ich gehe unter die Decke, weil ich friere.
__label__de	Einige Zeit lebten sie in Norwegen.
__label__de	Er war schon immer so.
__label__de	Anna schlüpfte unter die Decke, denn ihr war kalt.
__label__de	Ich gehe ins Bett, weil ich müde bin.

__label__de	Du beherrschst Englisch besser als ich.
__label__de	Sie hat mich noch nicht einmal angesehen.
__label__de	Sie sah mich noch nicht einmal an.
__label__de	Warum kämpfen sie nicht für ihre Rechte?
__label__de	Weißt du, warum ich schmolle? Weil du nie hier bist!
__label__de	Ich denke, das kann man annehmen.
__label__de	Ich weiß nicht, wo ich auf Tom warten soll.
__label__de	Vielleicht kann ich es finden.
__label__de	Ich habe auch mit Tom geredet.
__label__de	Es ziemt sich nicht, Salat mit einem Messer zu schneiden.

__label__de	Ich brauche einen Tisch für acht Personen.
__label__de	Die Einwohner von Bristol nennt man „Bristolians“.
__label__de	Ich denke, es ist an der Zeit für ein ruhiges Wochenende.
__label__de	Das klang nicht sehr überzeugend.
__label__de	Ein Eichhörnchen flitzte über die Straße und sprang an einem Baum hoch.
__label__de	Es gefällt mir sehr, dass man seinen Geordie-Dialekt hören kann, wenn er singt.
__label__de	Tom ging hin, um Schmalzkringel zu holen.
__label__de	Die größte Tür ist neben dem Fenster.
__label__de	Wenn du den Brief geschrieben hast, schicke ich ihn ab.
__label__de	Was war unter der Lampe?
__label__de	Sie hätte gar nicht erst gehen sollen!
__label__de	Hast du es je so versucht?
__label__de	Habt ihr es je so versucht?
__label__de	Haben Sie es je so versucht?
__label__de	Billiger muss nicht immer schlechter bedeuten.
__label__de	Sie wurde im Urlaub krank und musste einen Arzt ausfindig machen.

__label__de	Sind in diesen Weintrauben Kerne?
__label__de	Sind diese Weintrauben mit Kernen?
__label__de	Mir kam der Gedanke, dass er log.
__label__de	Ich gratulierte ihr zur erfolgreich bestandenen Prüfung.
__label__de	Die Professoren hatten einen Streit.
__label__de	Die Mädchen legten Geld zusammen, um der armen Familie zu helfen.

__label__de	Mein Schwiegervater ist zur Zeit ein bisschen schlecht auf mich zu sprechen. Nun ja, das gibt sich!
__label__de	Ich kenne das Geheimnis.
__label__de	Tom hat diese Frau sozusagen aus der Gosse gefischt. Feines Benehmen kann man von der nicht erwarten.

__label__de	Denk daran: es steht i vor e außer nach c.
__label__de	Irgendein Typ hatte sich das Hemd vollgekotzt.
__label__de	Heute Nacht kann ich nicht einschlafen.
__label__de	Ich möchte ein Boot mieten.
__label__de	Er ist gerade erst weggegangen.

__label__de	Sind Sie mal zu einem Fußballspiel gegangen, als Sie in England waren?
__label__de	Durham ist eine englische Stadt.
__label__de	Der Schornstein muss neu verfugt werden. Der Mörtel zwischen den Ziegeln ist schon ganz bröselig.
__label__de	Ich weiß, dass das leichter gesagt als getan ist, aber ich finde, du solltest das anfechten.
__label__de	Sie wuschelte ihm durchs Haar.
__label__de	Ein Stück weiter ist ein Stau. Fahren wir woanders lang!

__label__de	Ich war kaum im Haus, als das Telefon klingelte.
__label__de	Glas ist billiger als Aluminium.
__label__de	Kaum dass ich zu Hause war, klingelte das Telefon.
__label__de	Ich habe dein Geschenk heute abgeschickt!
__label__de	Ich freue mich zu hören, dass es dir wieder besser geht.
__label__de	Hilf mir, die Zeitungen zu bündeln.
__label__de	Helfen Sie mir, die Zeitungen zu bündeln.
__label__de	Man ersuchte um Frieden.
__label__de	Ich hoffe, dieser Brief findet dich bei bester Gesundheit.
__label__de	Ist Glas ein Metall?
__label__de	Die Sterne leuchten wie Diamanten am brasilianischen Nachthimmel.
__label__de	Ich suche nach Kristallen; hast du welche gesehen?
__label__de	Stimmt alles?
__label__de	Ich habe einen Kristall gefunden; sieh ihn dir an!
__label__de	Ich wohne in diesem Steinhaus auf dem Berg.
__label__de	Ich verstehe selbst nicht, wie das passiert ist.
__label__de	Er weiß nur, was ich ihm gesagt habe.
__label__de	Bis ich das alles fertig habe, werde ich grau geworden sein.
__label__de	„Sie kennen mich wohl nicht.“ – „Du hast ins Schwarze getroffen, Alter! Wer zum Teufel sind Sie denn?“
__label__de	Wer sind die dort?
__label__de	Mama, ich habe einen Papierflieger gemacht.
__label__de	„Man sagt, Tom, Maria habe dich verprügelt.“ – „Ach, Quatsch! Es waren fünf gegen mich.“
__label__de	Was sagen Ihnen die Stimmen?
__label__de	Das Taschenmesser öffnete sich in seiner Hand.
__label__de	Meine Großmutter hat eine eiserne Bratpfanne.
__label__de	Es ging um mehr Geld.
__label__de	Er ist so stark wegen des Spinats.
__label__de	Ich werde dich nicht aufhalten, wenn du gehen willst.
__label__de	Geh, wenn du gehen willst!
__label__de	Geben Sie ihm ein Schwert!
__label__de	Wir bevorzugen Pappbecher, weil sie leichter sind.
__label__de	Ich habe Euro gekauft.
__label__de	Ich mache Tee.
__label__de	Kannst du es hier heraufwerfen?
__label__de	Sam bot mir eines ihrer Sandwiches mit Erdnussbutter und Marmite an.
__label__de	Er war nur mit ihr zusammen, weil er eine Lückenbüßerin brauchte.
__label__de	Meine Tante ist plastische Chirurgin.
__label__de	Wir unterhielten uns gerade, da unterbrach Angela uns und bat uns um Hilfe.
__label__de	Holst du mich vom Bahnsteig ab?
__label__de	Gleich vor dem Fenster war eine Bushaltestelle.
__label__de	Wie geht es deiner Mama?
__label__de	Alte, selten gespielte Alben wieder neu zu entdecken als etwas, wovon man kaum weiß, wie man ohne ausgekommen ist, das ist schon etwas Magisches.
__label__de	Ist das Ihr Handgepäck?

__label__de	Reist Tom heute oder morgen ab?
__label__de	Wegen Wartungsarbeiten fahren heute zwischen Stoke-on-Trent und Crewe Busse statt Zügen.
__label__de	Am ersten und dritten Mittwoch jedes Monats findet ein Bauernmarkt statt.
__label__de	Es hatte gerade viel geschneit.
__label__de	Warum ist Erdgas billiger als Benzin?
__label__de	Es geht ihm nicht so gut.
__label__de	Ich gehe, aber der Staat wird immer bleiben.
__label__de	Das sieht wirklich gut aus.
__label__de	Hat Tom ein Klavier?
__label__de	Musik, Bücher und die Tanzfläche zählen zu den größen Fluchtmöglichkeiten des Lebens.
__label__de	Da kommt jemand.
__label__de	Ihre Schlafsäcke waren nass.
__label__de	Wir brauchen nicht an der Konferenz teilzunehmen.
__label__de	Seither hat sich die Lage stark verschlechtert.
__label__de	Der Richter hat seine Entscheidung getroffen.
__label__de	Ich möchte einen Müsliriegel essen.
__label__de	Das ist ein perfekter Platz für unser Picknick.
__label__de	Es war ganz anders, als sie erwartet hatte.
__label__de	Er hat es aus eigenem Antrieb getan.
__label__de	Es hätte mir jemand sagen sollen, dass sie gegangen ist.
__label__de	„Warum sind Sie Übersetzer geworden?“ – „Das hat sich einfach so ergeben.“
__label__de	„Warum bist du Übersetzerin geworden?“ – „Einfach so.“
__label__de	Das hat mich nicht nur ein bisschen schockiert.
__label__de	Ich erinnere mich, den Brief gestern eingeworfen zu haben.
__label__de	Du musst dich nicht so Hals über Kopf anziehen. Wir haben Zeit.

__label__de	Er ist kein schlechtaussehender Typ.
__label__de	Der Fluss ist sehr seicht.
__label__de	Der Tee schmeckt wirklich gut.
__label__de	Im Café nebenan kostet eine Tasse Kaffee nur halb soviel.

__label__de	Er singt und tanzt gerne.
__label__de	Der Straßenlärm beeinträchtigte unsere Arbeit.
__label__de	Wenn du sein könntest, was du wolltest, was wäre das?
__label__de	In unserem Garten gibt es viel Rasen sowie viele schöne Blumen und hohe Bäume.

__label__de	Wann wollen Sie ihn mal auf Ihre Gehaltserhöhung ansprechen?
__label__de	Mach dich nicht lächerlich! Wir sind nur befreundet, wenn auch gut.
__label__de	Ich habe das Formular sorgsam ausgefüllt.
__label__de	Das ist ein völliges Missverständnis.
__label__de	Euro wird auch angenommen.
__label__de	Seltenere und unüblichere Anordnungen von Wörtern in einem Satz haben nicht selten eine größere Kraft im Ausdruck und können auch poetisch wirken.
__label__de	Auch viele Länder außerhalb der Eurozone akzeptieren den Euro.
__label__de	In vielen Ferienorten akzeptieren Geschäfte oft nur noch Euros oder Dollars.
__label__de	Der Mensch kann zwar tun, was er will, er kann aber nicht wollen, was er will.
__label__de	Die Spur ist gut sichtbar.
__label__de	Das ist eine Hundespur.
__label__de	Das ist eine Fuchsspur.
__label__de	Die Sonne fängt an zu scheinen.
__label__de	Wir haben die zwei Bette zusammengeschoben.
__label__de	Wir schoben die zwei Betten aneinander.
__label__de	Wir haben die zwei Betten auseinandergeschoben.
__label__de	Das ist der Zauberbann, womit du alles stillst: Wolle nur, was du sollst, so kannst du, was du willst.
__label__de	Es ist alles eine Lüge!
__label__de	Der Charakter ändert sich, wenn man an die Macht kommt.
__label__de	Denken ist anstrengend.
__label__de	Das Dorf befindet sich in einem Tal.
__label__de	Fliegen schwirren um uns herum wie Elektronen um Atomkerne.
__label__de	Wann finden die nationalen Wahlen statt?
__label__de	Wieso ruft die mich nicht an?
__label__de	Vor dem Spiel singen die Spieler ihre Nationalhymne.
__label__de	Wieso rufen Sie mich nicht an?
__label__de	Sie erzählen mir nie etwas.
__label__de	Wo werden Sie Ihre Stimme abgeben?
__label__de	Wo geben Sie Ihre Stimme ab?
__label__de	Tom kann trotzdem nicht kommen.
__label__de	Ich will nicht schlafen, obwohl ich müde bin.
__label__de	Man erwartete ihn nicht, trotzdem kam er.
__label__de	Es gibt mitunter auch gute Antworten.
__label__de	So ein voller Einkaufswagen! Vor dem Preis an der Kasse graust es mich jetzt schon.
__label__de	Wir sollten uns allmählich nach einer anderen Kaffeemarke umsehen. Diese wird mir langsam zu teuer.
__label__de	Das wird nicht nur immer teurer, sondern bekommt auch eine immer schlechtere Qualität.
__label__de	Die Butter ist geschmolzen.
__label__de	Die werden sich die Zähne ausbeißen!
__label__de	Letztlich hat unsere Mannschaft das Endspiel verloren.
__label__de	Die Blätter fallen ab.
__label__de	Der Premierminister spricht kein Englisch.
__label__de	Das ist das Hausboot, auf dem wir gewohnt haben.
__label__de	Ich erinnere mich, deinen Brief gestern eingeworfen zu haben.
__label__de	Ich erinnere mich, Ihren Brief gestern eingeworfen zu haben.
__label__de	In dieser Halle ist es kalt.
__label__de	Wir haben gerade Besuch.
__label__de	Tom zeigte sich im Siege großmütig.
__label__de	Tom wusste nicht, dass Maria so fließend Englisch sprach.
__label__de	Darauf haben wir keinen Einfluss.
__label__de	Der Fahrer teilte uns mit, dass das Essen im Bus verboten sei.
__label__de	Die Fahrerin teilte uns mit, dass das Essen im Bus verboten sei.
__label__de	Sie erzählte mir kurz, was geschehen war.
__label__de	Wir gehen gewöhnlich an den Strand.
__label__de	Als ich durchs Fenster blickte, sah ich einen Mann an der Tür stehen.
__label__de	Er drückt seine Wärmflasche an sich.
__label__de	Leg uns doch ein paar von diesen hübschen Würsten auf den Grill!
__label__de	In der Innenstadt wird der Verkehr um Baustellen herumgeleitet.
__label__de	Sie ist schon einmal hiergewesen und ich auch.
__label__de	Was er sagt, stimmt in gewissem Sinne.
__label__de	Ich schreibe meinem Freund einen Brief.
__label__de	„Wie viele Minister hat die Regierung?“ – „Siebenunddreißig!“
__label__de	Der allgemeine Entwicklung zeigt einen Rückgang der Vogelarten.
__label__de	Feuer hat ein Gebiet seltenen Heidelands vernichtet.
__label__de	Bringen Sie mir bitte Haferbrei.
__label__de	Dieses Produkt wurde im Fernsehen beworben.
__label__de	Sie verreiste mit ihrer Freundin.
__label__de	Läuft es gut?
__label__de	Bewegungen haben Ergebnisse.
__label__de	Ist ihre Schwester eine Kandidatin?
__label__de	Ich bin dein König und du bist meine Königin.
__label__de	Ich bin Ihr König und Sie sind meine Königin.
__label__de	Ein liegengebliebener Lkw blockiert in beiden Richtungen den Verkehr.
__label__de	Er lernte fleißig, um die Prüfung zu schaffen.
__label__de	Im Sommer gehe ich gern auf dem Lande laufen.
__label__de	Hast du etwas dabei?
__label__de	Habt ihr etwas dabei?
__label__de	Haben Sie etwas dabei?
__label__de	Es bringt nichts, mit der Vergangenheit zu hadern.
__label__de	So, wie es war, wird es nie wieder. Man kann nicht zurück.
__label__de	Nun gehe hin und amüsiere dich! Die Arbeit kann warten.
__label__de	Die Verkaufszahlen des Buches haben sich im letzten Jahr verdreifacht.
__label__de	Die haben ein kleines Haus.
__label__de	Der Preis war lächerlich hoch.
__label__de	Die Schüler hörten während seiner Rede aufmerksam zu.
__label__de	Sie sah eine Aufführung nach der anderen.
__label__de	Tom ist Müllmann.
__label__de	Es besteht ein Mangel an Autoersatzteilen.
__label__de	Dass er bei der Prüfung durchgefallen war, trieb ihn in die Verzweiflung.
__label__de	Ich habe mit ihr viel gemein.
__label__de	Ein Lkw hat sich auf der Autobahn quergestellt.
__label__de	Ich bin halb nach nach Mitternacht ins Bett gegangen.
__label__de	Geh nicht zu weit vor!
__label__de	Fahr nicht zu weit vor!
__label__de	Ein Schuss wie aus der Kanone brachte die Querlatte zum Erzittern.
__label__de	Ich bin inspiriert, Zeichensprache zu lernen.
__label__de	Gib dein Bestes, und du wirst es später nicht bereuen.
__label__de	Natürlich waren im Kommunismus auch nicht alle gleich.
__label__de	Du stinkst wie ein Penner!
__label__de	Der Roman hat mehr als sechshundert Seiten.
__label__de	Wir essen wenig Brot.
__label__de	Zuerst esse ich das Wiener Schnitzel und danach die Beilage.
__label__de	Ich habe Wiener Schnitzel mit Petersilienkartoffel gegessen und danach Linzer Augen als Dessert.
__label__de	Was bedeutet Sklave?
__label__de	Ich wünschte, ich könnte sagen, dass es heutzutage keine Sklaven mehr gibt.
__label__de	Der Journalist interviewt den Politiker.
__label__de	Die Journalistin interviewt den Politiker.
__label__de	Wir haben ihn in Menschenmenge nicht gefunden.
__label__de	Der Irländer schreibt.
__label__de	Der Ire schreibt.
__label__de	Schnee verminderte die Sicht.
__label__de	Ich muss sowieso bis sechs üben.
__label__de	Schnee vermindert die Sicht.
__label__de	Draußen bläst ein Sturm.
__label__de	Auf dem Fußweg lagen überall heruntergefallene Zwetschen herum.
__label__de	Ich bin unentschlossen, ob ich gehen soll.
__label__de	Tom traf mit einem Fallrückzieher, und eine alte Dame, die auf dem Weg zur Bushaltestelle war, jubelte.
__label__de	Er hat sein Studium abgebrochen.
__label__de	Sie sagte sich, dass sie einfach nicht mehr darüber nachdenken würde.
__label__de	Ein Band mit starkem Regen nähert sich den Grafschaften im Osten.
__label__de	Er saß auf dem Kai.
__label__de	Wer hat mir den Stift geklaut?
__label__de	Wir alle halten es für falsch, bei einer Klassenarbeit zu spicken.
__label__de	Das Schloss steht genau in der Mitte der Stadt.
__label__de	Ich hoffe, du hast eine nicht unangenehme Woche.
__label__de	Ich hoffe, ihr habt eine nicht unangenehme Woche.
__label__de	Ich hoffe, Sie haben eine nicht unangenehme Woche.
__label__de	Ich wollte nur mal nachsehen, ob sie da ist.
__label__de	Es war eine späte Absage.
__label__de	Die Aufführung wurde mit Applaus bedacht.
__label__de	Die Leber ist ein Organ des menschlichen Körpers.
__label__de	Er ist der starke Arm, und ich bin das Gehirn.
__label__de	Jemand folgt uns.
__label__de	Ebola und HIV können inzwischen behandelt werden.
__label__de	Wie hoch bemisst du dieses Ding?
__label__de	Hallo, was wollen Sie?
__label__de	Was haben sie vorgeschlagen?
__label__de	Warum sollte ich das nicht machen?
__label__de	Und der Junge wurde größer.
__label__de	Wir ziehen in eine andere Miete; näher zu meinem Arbeitsplatz.
__label__de	Warum liest du nicht einfach die Anweisungen?
__label__de	Da steht jemand am Tor.
__label__de	Das Rolltor geht nicht runter.
__label__de	Ich wechsle den Job wegen des Geldes.
__label__de	Die Katze will herein.
__label__de	„Wenn du schon mal da bist, könntest du gleich die Glühbirne im Badezimmer auswechseln.“ – „Eigentlich bin ich gekommen, um mich für immer zu verabschieden.“
__label__de	Dies sind die Anweisungen.
__label__de	Sie sind immer pleite.
__label__de	Leeren Sie die Schublade.
__label__de	Wir aßen Meerrettich mit Kwas.
__label__de	Der Reiter saß rittlings zu Pferde.
__label__de	Wir sind hier auf Meereshöhe.
__label__de	Ein Sieg heute Abend ist wichtig, um den drohenden Abstieg abzuwenden.
__label__de	Ich weiß nicht, woran das liegt.
__label__de	Die ihr nahestehen, sagen, sie sei verzagt gewesen.
__label__de	Es kennen einen mehr, als einem lieb ist.
__label__de	Unsere Mannschaft arbeitet unter Hochdruck, um die Fristen einzuhalten.
__label__de	Durch ein Kirchenfenster fallend, wird das Licht bunt.
__label__de	Seit Generationen hat sich nichts geändert.
__label__de	Dann kam er wieder zu sich.
__label__de	Mein Vater sagt, er sei bei der Aufnahmeprüfung zweimal durchgefallen.
__label__de	Die Lehrerin setzte sich eine Blumenkrone, die ihr die Schüler gemacht hatten, auf.
__label__de	Ich gehe hinaus, um sonnenzubaden.
__label__de	Ein Herr Sakaki will Sie sehen.
__label__de	Fräulein Schmidt wurde zur Vorsitzenden ernannt.
__label__de	Die untergehende Sonne ist rot.
__label__de	Das Studium war eine schöne Erfahrung.
__label__de	Es gibt nicht viele Kerle, die so nett sind!
__label__de	Toms Lieblingsmusikgruppe sind die Rolling Stones; ich hingegen ziehe da die Kinks vor.
__label__de	Die Straßen waren voller Leute im Einkaufstrubel.
__label__de	Welchen hast du dir ausgesucht?
__label__de	Welche hast du dir ausgesucht?
__label__de	Welches hast du dir ausgesucht?
__label__de	Lammfleisch ist mir lieber als Rindfleisch.
__label__de	Harriet wählte sich „Lonesome Tonight“ als Lieblingslied von New Order, wohingegen sich Robin „Ecstasy“ erkor.
__label__de	Das Tor hing nicht mehr in den Angeln.
__label__de	Wo ist die Notiz geblieben?
__label__de	Handelsketten verkaufen fast mehr Verpackungsmaterial als tatsächliche Waren.
__label__de	Maria saß am Fenster, genüsslich eine Tasse Tee trinkend, und sah zu, wie sich vor dem Haus der Parkplatz leerte.
__label__de	Spiel mir hier nicht den Unschuldigen!
__label__de	Spiel mir hier nicht die Unschuldige!
__label__de	Das Ruderboot trieb vom Ufer weg.
__label__de	Wir haben gerade ein ungewöhnlich hohes Aufkommen an Anrufe zu verzeichnen.
__label__de	So was wird heute gar nicht mehr produziert.
__label__de	Die Nachricht hat uns schockiert.
__label__de	Ich muss wissen, wie lange du brauchst.
__label__de	Ich muss wissen, wie lange Sie brauchen.
__label__de	Bei Steve auf der Arbeit kommen Computeralgorithmen zum Einsatz, um die Produktivität der Angestellten zu überprüfen.
__label__de	„Mir gefällt dieses kalte Wetter sehr“, sagte er. Da spricht einer, der nachts in einem warmen Bette schläft.
__label__de	Er wurde herausgewählt.
__label__de	Die Abstimmung fand gestern statt.
__label__de	Das Haus stand in Flammen, als der Feuerwehrwagen eintraf.
__label__de	Die sind nicht zu erkennen.
__label__de	Der Weg war von Laub bedeckt.
__label__de	Es ist mir egal, ob sie in der Stadt oder auf dem Lande lebt.
__label__de	Das ist nur ein Hirngepinst.
__label__de	Bei ihm sah es kinderleicht aus.
__label__de	Er ist am Samstag angekommen.
__label__de	Wenn man fröhlich ist, können Bücher das Glück noch steigern; wenn man traurig ist, können Bücher die Trübsal lindern.
__label__de	Herr Mitsue kam gestern bei mir vorbei.
__label__de	Fräulein Mitsue kam gestern bei mir vorbei.
__label__de	Der junge Knabe war ein guter Schüler.
__label__de	Wenn man sich im Winter nicht warm anzieht, kann das dazu führen, dass man sich schwer erkältet.
__label__de	Er wartete im fahlen Sonnenlicht auf sie.
__label__de	Er läuft bei weitem am schnellsten.
__label__de	Die Sonne war kurz davor aufzugehen.
__label__de	Es war kurz vor Sonnenaufgang, da zog sich die Vampirin zurück.
__label__de	Die Fenster sind mit Laternen geschmückt.
__label__de	Das ist mein geheimer Garten.
__label__de	Ganz recht, Kumpel!
__label__de	Die Sonne scheint über unseren Köpfen.
__label__de	Ich kann Heuchler nicht ausstehen.
__label__de	Tom redet wie ein Mädchen.
__label__de	Einen kürzeren Weg gibt es nicht.
__label__de	Toni heißt eigentlich Anna, aber sie hat sich aufgrund ihrer vollkommenen Androgynität selbst diesen neutralen Namen gegeben, um den Effekt, dass die Leute ihr Geschlecht einfach nicht einschätzen können, woran sie immer sehr viel Spaß hat, noch zu verstärken.
__label__de	Toni kann sich aufgrund ihrer Androgynität jeden Tag, je nach Stimmung, aussuchen, ob sie als Junge oder als Mädchen wahrgenommen werden oder ob sie die Leute verwirren will. Sie kleidet sich dann einfach entsprechend.
__label__de	Ich habe zum Satz eine andere Übersetzung hinzugefügt.
__label__de	Es macht Toni einen Riesenspaß, die Leute zu verwirren.
__label__de	Mir fehlt in meinem Leben nichts.
__label__de	„Ich wollte doch heute einen Käsekuchen backen, aber ich habe völlig vergessen, Schlagsahne zu kaufen.“ – „Der schmeckt doch bestimmt auch ohne.“
__label__de	Dein kürzerer Weg dauert länger.
__label__de	„Ich wollte doch heute Zwetschenkuchen backen, aber ich habe völlig vergessen, Papa Schlagsahne auf die Einkaufsliste zu schreiben.“ – „Dann fahr’ ich halt mit dem Fahrrad hin und hol’ dir welche, Mama!“ – „Du bist ein Schatz!“
__label__de	„Soll ich fertige Schlagsahne in der Sprühflasche kaufen oder einen Becher frische?“ – „Frische bitte, aber lieber zwei Becher!“
__label__de	„In einer Stunde kommen die Gäste. Wie soll ich bis dahin fertig werden!“ – „Du schaffst das schon!“
__label__de	Lass doch nicht immer sämtliche Türen offenstehen!
__label__de	Die Türen sind nicht dazu da, dass man sie offenstehen lässt! Mach sie hinter dir zu!
__label__de	„Was hast du denn da gekauft? Was ist denn das für Butter?“ – „Die war im Angebot.“
__label__de	Wieviel Butter kostet, darüber hat man sonst nie nachgedacht, aber inzwischen ist sie, wie alles, schweineteuer.
__label__de	„Irgendwann einmal hat ein Liter Milch 75 Cent gekostet.“ – „Das ist aber lange her.“ – „Unterbrich mich nicht! Inzwischen sind wir bei 1,80 Euro angelangt.“ – „1,79 Euro, wenn ich nicht irre.“ – „Um so unverschämter! Da sollen sie doch gleich 1,80 Euro verlangen!“
__label__de	Seit der Coronakrisa ist Klopapier fast schon ein Luxusgut. Man bekommt nur noch halb oder zu einem Drittel so große Packungen zum doppelten Preis.
__label__de	Die Preissteigerungen fingen beim Sonnenblumenöl und beim Mehl an, aber inzwischen machen schon alle mit, nur dass es keine höheren Löhne gibt.
__label__de	Die Vogelscheuche und der Igel begleiteten mich auf meinem Wege.
__label__de	„Was hat ein Liter Milch damals noch zu D-Mark-Zeiten gekostet?“ – „Das weiß ich wirklich nicht mehr. Du stellst Fragen!“
__label__de	Unsere Möwen sind weiß.
__label__de	Hier kann das nicht passieren.
__label__de	Es wäre gut, wenn das Dach vor dem Winter repariert werden könnte.
__label__de	Es wäre gut, das Dach vor dem Winter zu reparieren.
__label__de	Diese Kekse habe ich beim Krämer gekauft.
__label__de	Wir könnten einige Tage verreisen.
__label__de	„Im Augenblick, als sich der Ball von meinem Fuße löste, wusste ich, dass es ein Tor würde“, sagte Tom.
__label__de	Es zieht wie Hechtsuppe in diesem Zimmer.
__label__de	Ein Sonnenbrand reizt die Haut.
__label__de	Eine Reihe alter Häuser wird abgerissen, um Platz für neue Wohnungen zu schaffen.
__label__de	Ich weiß, welche Partei ich wählen soll.
__label__de	„Da liegt wieder diese finstere Miene auf Toms Gesicht. Was hat er?“ – „Das heißt gewöhnlich, dass das Gesagte bei ihm keine Zustimmung findet.“
__label__de	Dies ist ein Saiteninstrument.
__label__de	Er ist auf eine Beförderung aus.
__label__de	Wenn du das glaubst, dann glaubst du alles.
__label__de	Das sagt sie immer.
__label__de	Er griff nach seinem Stift.
__label__de	Schreibst du ein Buch?
__label__de	Hilfst du mit, oder willst du einfach nur dasitzen und uns blöd von der Seite anmeckern?
__label__de	Was für ein Buch schreibst du?
__label__de	Sie sind mit dem Bus gefahren.
__label__de	Fred will am Montag nach Europa.
__label__de	Er hat viel zuviel gearbeitet und nachts kaum geschlafen; da musste er zwangsläufig krank werden.
__label__de	Er schlich auf leisen Sohlen aus dem Zimmer, um sie nicht aufzuwecken.
__label__de	Ihn quälte das Gewissen.
__label__de	Es ist jeden Freitag um sechs.
__label__de	Wenn Ihre Lizenz abgelaufen ist, können Sie folgendermaßen eine neue erhalten.
__label__de	Ich hole dich morgen vom Bahnsteig ab.
__label__de	Ich hole euch morgen vom Bahnsteig ab.
__label__de	Ich hole Sie morgen vom Bahnsteig ab.
__label__de	In den nächsten Tagen soll es kälter werden.
__label__de	Pelé hat als einziger dreimal bei der Weltmeisterschaft gewonnen.
__label__de	Die Berge sind im Sommer satt grün.
__label__de	Wir haben es ihm gesagt; anscheinend hat er es vergessen.
__label__de	Die Erinnerung belastete ihn sehr.
__label__de	„Tom hat schon wieder, und ich unterstelle ihm, mit voller Absicht, die Papiertonne dahin gestellt, wo, wie ich ihm schon tausendmal gesagt habe, die Restmülltonne stehen soll! Ich will, dass er bestraft wird!“ – „Da stehen wir doch drüber. Es ist mir völlig egal, in welcher Anordnung diese Tonnen hinterm Haus stehen.“ – „Mir aber nicht!“
__label__de	Das ist nicht unser Niveau.
__label__de	Sie ist bezüglich ihrer Pläne verschlossen.
__label__de	Wie du dich gebettet hast, so musst du nun auch liegen.
__label__de	Gibt es bei den Prüfungsergebnissen regionale Unterschiede?
__label__de	Welch ein Ärgernis für Sie, alle diese Änderungen vornehmen zu müssen.
__label__de	Ich glaube, meine Freundin fährt morgen nach Schottland.
__label__de	Selbst in einem leeren Raum würde Tom noch einen Streit vom Zaun brechen.
__label__de	Gesunde Seele in gesundem Körper.
__label__de	Eine gesunde Seele wohnt in einem gesunden Körper.
__label__de	Ein gesunder Geist wohnt in einem gesunden Körper.
__label__de	Dieser Politiker sagt, dass er die Regierung unterstützt.
__label__de	Ich hoffe, das Video hat euch gefallen. Falls ja, dann könnt ihr mir natürlich ein Däumchen dalassen.
__label__de	Er wollte eine Abkürzung durch den Wald nehmen, wurde dort jedoch von Feen in ihr Reich entführt. Hundert Jahre später kehrte er zurück, glaubend, es wären nur drei Tage gewesen.
__label__de	Die Armee errichtete die Diktatur.
__label__de	Wenn euch das Video gefallen hat, lasst mir ein Däumchen da, und schreibt mir in die Kommentare, was ihr gerne als nächstes sehen möchtet.
__label__de	Warum will jeder bei Youtube, dass man den Kanal abonniert, das Glöckchen anklickt, Däumchen vergibt und Kommentare schreibt?
__label__de	„Mama schaut sich schon wieder eine südamerikanische Seifenoper an. Ich denke also, sie kommt nicht mit.“ – „Und seit wann ist ‚Süleyman‘ ein brasilianischer Name?“

__label__de	Tom schwor seinen Eid bei der Gottesmutter und allen Heiligen, was die Protestanten nicht wenig verärgerte.
__label__de	Tom bezeichnete die Jungfrau Maria, voll religiöser Hingabe vor ihrer Figur kniend, als seine Königin und süßeste Generalissima.
__label__de	Tom betete zur Jungfrau Maria, dass sie ihm helfen möge.
__label__de	Tom hat einen Schrein, welcher der Jungfrau Maria, der Gottesmutter, gewidmet ist. Vor diesem verbringt er jeden Tag Stunden im Gebet.
__label__de	An Gott selbst wagte sich Tom nicht zu wenden, und er fühlte, dass, angesichts der Fülle seiner Sünden, auch Christus erst würde gnädig gestimmt werden müssen. Maria, die Sanfte, die Süße, die Mütterliche, schien ihm die richtige Fürsprecherin zu sein. Er wolle ihr eine Kirche bauen, so sie ihn erhöre.
__label__de	Tom ließ sich vom Kaiser zum Generalissimus ernennen und zog mit einem Heer von 50 000 Mann nach Norden gegen die Protestanten.

__label__de	Ich habe schon was gesehen, ich weiß aber nicht, was das war.
__label__de	Sie lächelte zum Dank.
__label__de	Auf diesem Wege ist es kürzer.
__label__de	In diese Richtung ist Tomsdorf näher.

__label__de	Hast du das Buch schon fertiggelesen?

__label__de	Wir warteten auf den Bus, aber er kam nicht. Später erfuhren wir, die Fahrerin habe sich, an ihrem ersten Arbeitstag, in den engen Straßen der Innenstadt ver- und schließlich inmitten am Straßenrand parkender Autos festgefahren. Davon wurde in der Zeitung berichtet.
__label__de	Gleich an ihrem ersten Arbeitstag als Busfahrerin wurde ein Alptraum wahr, und Anna musste unter Polizeieinsatz aus einer engen Straße, in die sie sich verfahren hatte, gerettet werden. Der Bus fiel für den Rest des Tages aus, und der gesamte Innenstadtverkehr musste umgeleitet werden. Es wurde sogar in der Zeitung darüber berichtet.
__label__de	Die Kämpferinnen in diesem Film können fliegen, über den Wassern wandeln, mit der Fußspitze federleicht auf einem Schwert stehen, mit dem ein anderer gerade fechten will, Pfeile mit der Hand auffangen: kurz gesagt haben sie sich übermenschliche Kräfte zu eigen gemacht.
__label__de	Ich frage mich schon die ganze Zeit, woher dieser Geruch kommt. Tom, das bist du! Geh sofort duschen, und zieh dir etwas anderes an, wenn du fertig bist!
__label__de	Die im Englischen beliebten Wortspiele können nicht ins Deutsche hinübergerettet werden. Das Resultat ist immer schrecklich.

__label__de	„True Faith“ („Wahrer Glaube“) war die einzige Single, die für die Kompilation „Substance“ von New Order aufgenommen und von derselben veröffentlicht wurde; dies war eine Sammlung von ansonsten schon zuvor herausgebrachten A-Seiten und B-Seiten im 12-Zoll-Format, von denen einige neu eingespielt wurden.

__label__de	Der Bleistift ist stumpf.

Vorgeblich geht es darin um das bevorstehende Spiel; so sind Neuigkeiten und Wissenswertes über die Mannschaft enthalten, Gespräche mit Vereinsmitgliedern, oft ein Beitrag des Trainers, Meldungen über die gegnerische Mannschaft usf. Gewöhnlich betrachtet man diese Programme als Memorabilia.

__label__de	Mary ist ziemlich sauer auf mich, oder?
__label__de	Dieses Rohr ist verstopft.
__label__de	Er führt Berechnungen durch.
__label__de	Komm, das wird schon!
__label__de	Tom sollte Mary nicht vertrauen.
__label__de	Winke ihm zu.
__label__de	Wir wollen unsere kalten Nächte in Stoke.
__label__de	Das ist doch nicht dein Niveau, Tom.
__label__de	Ich lokalisiere die Software.
__label__de	Es ist diese Straße runter.

__label__de	Mein Sonnenbrand wirft schon Blasen.
__label__de	Ich habe mein Hemd reingewaschen.
__label__de	Der Verteidiger schwor Stein und Bein, dass er den Ball getreten hatte, nicht den Mann.

__label__de	Am Meer ist es immer windig.
__label__de	Toms Kassettenspieler fraß das Band, das Maria ihm geliehen hatte.

__label__de	Da wedelt der Schwanz mit dem Hunde.
__label__de	Jemand hat sich mit der Milch davongemacht.
__label__de	Dann und nur dann, wenn du unser Passwort kennst, kommst du hier herein.
__label__de	Soll ich spazierengehen?
__label__de	Tom verlor den Ball, und der Gegner startete einen Gegenangriff.

__label__de	Ich reise zu ihr.
__label__de	Er hat die Prüfung wegen mangelnder Vorbereitung nicht geschafft.
__label__de	Er ist wegen unzureichender Vorbereitung bei der Prüfung durchgefallen.

__label__de	Ich werde mich zur Abwechslung einmal kurz fassen und komme gleich zum Punkt.

__label__de	Danke schön! Ich war mit dieser Ausdrucksweise nicht vertraut und habe auch nichts im Netz gefunden.
__label__de	Wenn du auf andere eifersüchtig bist, wirst du nicht glücklich sein.
__label__de	Ihr Traum ist endlich in Erfüllung gegangen.
__label__de	Du liebst mich nicht?
__label__de	Sie hat drei Söhne.
__label__de	Welche Methode verwenden die Wissenschaftler?
__label__de	Sie hat drei Töchter.
__label__de	Ich habe zwei Kinder: einen Sohn und eine Tochter.
__label__de	Wir haben zwei Kinder: einen Sohn und eine Tochter.

__label__de	Der Astronaut fand einen intelligenten Organismus.
__label__de	„Schau mal, was ich in deinem Kleiderschrank für einen schönen Kaschmirpulli gefunden habe. Warum trägst du den denn nie?“ – „Der hat unter einem Ärmel ein Loch.“ – „Der ist nur an der Naht ein bisschen aufgegangen. Willst du das nicht flicken?“ – „Ne, das macht zuviel Mühe. Den schmeiß’ ich einfach in die Tonne und kauf’ mir einen neuen.“ – „Du bist so verschwenderisch, Tom! Dann flicke ich ihn eben selbst und behalte ihn.“
__label__de	Das Kleine ist auf dem Bauch seiner Mama eingeschlafen.
__label__de	Sie zog den Pullover ihres Freundes an.
__label__de	„Ich denke, es ist nicht so einfach.“ – „Doch.“
__label__de	Ich glaube, dass Gott existiert.

__label__de	Es gibt Gott.
__label__de	Es gibt keinen Teufel.
__label__de	Tom, du kannst glauben, was du willst.
__label__de	Es gibt keinen Teufel!
__label__de	Zum Teufel mit dem Teufel!
__label__de	Die Menschen waren so arm, dass die kleinen Kinder nackt waren.
__label__de	Und ein Gott ist, ein heiliger Wille lebt, wie auch der menschliche wanke; hoch über der Zeit und dem Raume webt lebendig der höchste Gedanke, und ob alles in ewigem Wechsel kreist, es beharret im Wechsel ein ruhiger Geist.
__label__de	Ist dieses Material für unser Projekt nützlich?
__label__de	Eisen ist ein sehr wichtiges Metall.
__label__de	Die chemischen Elemente haben auch eine Evolution.
__label__de	Es gibt keinen Teufel, aber es gibt Gott.
__label__de	„Ich glaube, es gibt keinen Gott.“ – „Und warum glaubst du das?“ – „Ich glaube es halt.“
__label__de	Der Teufel existiert nicht!
__label__de	Warum bist du dir dessen so sicher?
__label__de	Du bist wohl nicht nur dafür gekommen.
__label__de	Es kommt drauf an, worum du bitten willst.
__label__de	Ich bin selber nicht sicher, wie man das richtig schreibt.
__label__de	Wie viele Stunden hast du auf dem Zeitkonto?

__label__de	Komm einfach mal aus dem Internet raus und tu etwas, was dir Spaß macht!
__label__de	Der Herbsthimmel ist klar und heiter.
__label__de	Langgehegte Träume gehen nicht immer in Erfüllung.
__label__de	Meine Frau mag es lieber, in einer Stadt, in einem Plattenbau zu leben; ich nicht.
__label__de	Das Schlagloch war weniger eine kleine Unebenheit in der Straße als vielmehr ein gähnender Abgrund, der ein Auto als Ganzes hätte verschlingen können und noch Platz für weitere gehabt hätte.
__label__de	Jede Mannschaft weiß zu Beginn der Fußballsaison, dass sie am Ende absteigen und durch eine Mannschaft der nächstniedrigeren Liga ersetzt werden könnte.

__label__de	Man darf erst nach der Prüfung in Panik geraten.
__label__de	Tom hatte sich aufs Hemd gekotzt.

__label__de	Tom, wir verlangen Aufrichtigkeit von dir!
__label__de	Wie viele Gasgesetze gibt es, und wie lauten sie?
__label__de	Was habe ich denn getan, dass du so gemein zu mir bist?
__label__de	Ich bin bei Herrn Eliot als Mitarbeiterin beschäftigt.
__label__de	Aufgrund von Reparaturarbeiten an der Leitplanke ist die Autobahn in nördlicher Fahrtrichtung gesperrt.
__label__de	Tom redet ständig über die Nachbarn.
__label__de	Ich bin in einen karitativen Gebrauchtwarenladen gegangen, um die zum Verkauf stehenden Platten zu durchforsten.
__label__de	Sie hat sie mir genommen.
__label__de	Tom saß in der Abenddämmerung zu Pferde, da flog ein Feuerball über den Himmel, der ihm ins Gesicht schien, dass ihm die Augen leuchteten.
__label__de	Maria ringt mit sich, ob sie’s Tom sagen soll.
__label__de	Von dort ab steigt die Straße an.
__label__de	Es gab gerade einen Unfall.
__label__de	Die sind obdachlos.
__label__de	An sonnigen Tagen ist am Strand der Bär los.
__label__de	Sei die Person, die du als Kind gebraucht hättest.
__label__de	Als ich gerade duschte, klingelte es.
__label__de	Ihre Mama backt keine Kuchen, die schmecken.
__label__de	Das Wasser auf jeden Fall zum Kochen bringen, bevor die Nudeln dazugegeben werden.
__label__de	Sie rief ihren Sohn Pierre auf dessen mobilen Gerät an, da er ans Festnetztelefon zu Hause nie ging.
__label__de	Lasst uns ein bisschen herumtoben!
__label__de	Dies scheint der richtige Weg zu sein.
__label__de	Wie schreibt man ein Programm, das Sicherungskopien erstellt?
__label__de	Die sind nicht wiederzuerkennen.
__label__de	Ich will dir nichts aufdrängen.
__label__de	Ich habe da eine Woche lang nichts getan.
__label__de	Ich habe da eine müßige Woche verlebt.
__label__de	Ich hatte Fieber.
__label__de	Was ich wirklich nötig hatte, das war, mal wieder etwas Zeit mit meinen besten Freunden Tom und Maria, die ich schon ewig kenne, zu verbringen.
__label__de	Er fuhr nach Paris, und seitdem habe ich ihn nicht mehr gesehen.
__label__de	Die Wahl zu haben ist hier, als würde man gefragt, ob man lieber geschlagen oder getreten werden möchte.
__label__de	„City oder Rovers?“ – „Ich interessiere mich eigentlich nicht für Fußball, aber meine Familie war immer für City.“
__label__de	Melanie ist eine junge Mathematikerin.
__label__de	„Die Mensa war leer.“ – „Leer? Überhaupt keiner da?“ – „Keine Menschenseele.“
__label__de	Ich musste das Theater mitten im Konzert verlassen.
__label__de	Das Tauchen auf den Philippinen war der Wahnsinn, aber ich freue mich jetzt auf die Rückkehr nach Sydney.
__label__de	Es fällt schwer, dir zu widersprechen.
__label__de	England und Schottland sind Nachbarn.
__label__de	Er machte sich an die Arbeit.
__label__de	Peter will unbedingt einen Magneten am Kühlschrank haften haben.
__label__de	Die Beweise sind zweifelhaft.
__label__de	Glaubst du das alles?
__label__de	Glaubt ihr das alles?
__label__de	Glauben Sie das alles?
__label__de	Wie kann man die überhaupt vergleichen?
__label__de	So früh morgens hättest du gar nicht kommen müssen.
__label__de	In der Folge wurde sie krank.
__label__de	Sie hat eine blasse Gesichtsfarbe.
__label__de	Sie hat einen blassen Teint.
__label__de	Du täuschst mich mit deinen honigsüßen Worten nicht.
__label__de	Die denken, es wäre schon alles vorbei.
__label__de	Wird es noch geöffnet sein?
__label__de	Als er aus dem Zug stieg, begrüßte ihn sein Cousin.
__label__de	Als er aus dem Zug stieg, begrüßte ihn seine Cousine.
__label__de	Als er aus dem Zug stieg, begrüßte ihn sogleich sein Cousin.
__label__de	Ich bin schon ein paarmal in Boston gewesen, aber nur auf der Durchreise nach Skegness.
__label__de	Sei der Mensch, den du als Kind gebraucht hättest.
__label__de	Entschuldigen Sie. Haben Sie etwas gesagt?
__label__de	Ich bin ganz ehrlich.
__label__de	Ehrenwort?
__label__de	Mein Ehrenwort!
__label__de	Vor drei Jahren haben wir in London gelebt; dann sind wir hierhergezogen.
__label__de	Ich hoffe, du bist aufrichtig.
__label__de	Sie wehrten sich.
__label__de	Er ist ganz schön frech.
__label__de	Ich würde gewiss gerne hingehen und mir einen Film ansehen, aber ich bin mir nicht sicher, ob ich Zeit habe.
__label__de	London ist eine Hauptstadt. Madrid und Berlin sind auch Hauptstädte.
__label__de	Deine sind besser.
__label__de	Nach Aberystwyth fahren heute Abend keine Busse mehr.
__label__de	Früher sind wir immer im Urlaub ans Meer gefahren.
__label__de	Man muss die Ski genau parallel halten.
__label__de	Du musst die Ski genau parallel halten.
__label__de	Sie müssen die Ski genau parallel halten.
__label__de	Ihr müsst die Ski genau parallel halten.
__label__de	Sie müsste inzwischen dort sein, denn sie ist ja früh losgefahren.
__label__de	Er griff nach seiner Gitarre.
__label__de	Hast du deine Kamera dabei?
__label__de	Hast du eine Kamera dabei?
__label__de	Am Fluss führt ein schöner Weg entlang.
__label__de	Nähmest du mich mit?
__label__de	Die Flut trug das Boot aufs Meer hinaus.
__label__de	Wir haben uns da untergestellt.
__label__de	Verrate uns, was du an deinem großen Tag vorhast!
__label__de	Sie ging mit mir durch die Läden.
__label__de	Er war circa zehn Tage nicht da.
__label__de	Das ist wirklich ein schöner Satz.
__label__de	Der siebte Tag ist Sonntag.
__label__de	Was bedeutet Gott für Sie?
__label__de	Ich habe dir schlechte Nachrichten mitzuteilen.
__label__de	„Apples and pears“ („Äpfel und Birnen“) steht im Reimslang für „stairs“ („Treppe“).
__label__de	Wir steckten heute Morgen im dichten Verkehr fest.
__label__de	Ich überlege, ob ich mir in der Stadt etwas mieten sollte.
__label__de	United rettete zwar mit 1 : 1 ein Unentschieden, bleibt aber weiterhin in der Abstiegszone.
__label__de	Das einzige Geräusch, das wir hören konnten, war der Wind draußen.
__label__de	Mülltonnen mit Rädern sind über die Straße geweht worden.
__label__de	Es war die Angela, die dem Stefan den Wilhelm auf den Hals gehetzt hat.
__label__de	Sie ist bei ihrer Arbeit sehr genau.
__label__de	Harry ist in seiner Fußballmannschaft der Größte.
__label__de	Willst du einfach nur dastehen wie Piksieben?
__label__de	Die Sonne ist gelb. Der Himmel ist blau. Schnee ist weiß. Die Kirsche ist rot. Das Gras ist grün. Das Wasser ist farblos.
__label__de	Aus der Ferne betrachtet ist die Erde eine blaue Kugel.
__label__de	Die Erde ist braun. Die Wolken sind grau. Die Reifen sind schwarz.
__label__de	Wer hat uns in Birmingham besucht?
__label__de	Der Name Gaia, nach der gleichnamigen griechischen Göttin, für den Planeten Erde wurde von dem Wissenschaftler James Lovelock geprägt.
__label__de	Hörst du, wie dich jemand ruft?
__label__de	Sie war in einem bedauernswerten Zustand.
__label__de	Sie geht gern auf dem Land spazieren.
__label__de	Lass uns früh ins Bett gehen.
__label__de	Wurzelbier stinkt – und es handelt sich eigentlich um eine Fehlbezeichnung.
__label__de	Draußen weht es wie verrückt.
__label__de	Wir waren an jenem Abend im Kreise der Familie.
__label__de	Ein Streik legte den Postverkehr lahm.
__label__de	Ich habe überall nach meiner Brille gesucht, aber ich konnte sie nicht finden.
__label__de	Ich habe überall nach meiner Brille gesucht, aber es ist mir nicht gelungen, sie zu finden.
__label__de	Nach der Sitzung begab sie sich geradewegs an ihren Schreibtisch.
__label__de	Das ist inzwischen gang und gäbe.
__label__de	Wir haben jeder 5000 Yen bezahlt.
__label__de	Er ist überzeugt, dass man für Mr. Jones stimmen wird.
__label__de	Hol mal das Essen und den Grill aus dem Auto.
__label__de	Möwen und Pelikane sind Seevögel.
__label__de	Den Stecker nur dann in eine Steckdose stecken, wenn kein Staub und keine Flusen daran sind.
__label__de	Alle frühen Blumen biss der Frost.
__label__de	Das Lied „Dark Was the Night“ („Dunkel war die Nacht“) von Blind Willie Johnson zählt zu den auf den goldenen Datenplatten der Raumsonde Voyager enthaltenen Klangproben.
__label__de	Es sieht so aus, als hätte Toms Hemd einen Knopf verloren.
__label__de	Holst du mich vom Bus ab?
__label__de	Ich war im Bad und habe das Telefon nicht gehört.
__label__de	Der Verkehr brach nicht ab; daher beschloss ich, die Straße durch die Unterführung zu überqueren.
__label__de	Diese trockenen Stöcke brennen sofort.
__label__de	Rasiere dir den Schnurrbart ab.
__label__de	Leider sind jene Züge noch langsamer.
__label__de	Sind Sie Arzt, Herr?
__label__de	Sie hätten jemanden umbringen können.
__label__de	Sie verkaufen Postkarten.
__label__de	Wir haben lange auf deine Antwort gewartet.
__label__de	Ich bin müde aufgewacht.
__label__de	Versuch nicht, mich zu verarschen!
__label__de	Die Marillenkrapfen in den Regalen des Ladens waren noch halb gefroren.
__label__de	Das ist kein wesentlicher Unterschied.
__label__de	Das ist doch ein Fehler.
__label__de	Rauchst du immer noch diese Scheißzigaretten?
__label__de	Er braucht eine Frau.
__label__de	Es ist doch eine Zumutung, so spät zu telefonieren.
__label__de	Was für eine Zumutung!
__label__de	Die Antwort ist nein, und damit basta.
__label__de	Die Antwort ist ja.
__label__de	Maria brachte einen Jungen zur Welt.
__label__de	Weißt du, was eine Dialyse ist?
__label__de	Sie haben Marie gestern hier getroffen.
__label__de	Wie sehr hat sich der Plan verändert?
__label__de	Tom das Fahrrad zu geben, war eine gute Idee.
__label__de	Ich weiß nicht, wie ich Dich kontaktieren kann.
__label__de	Ich weiß, dass Ihr nicht wirklich mit auf diese Reise möchtet.
__label__de	Sie betrachtet mein schönes Bild.
__label__de	Selbst ein Kind kennt die Antwort.
__label__de	In drei Sekunden ist Mitternacht.
__label__de	Ich habe gehört, dass er sein Haus verkauft hat.
__label__de	Wir waren sehr müde nach fünf Stunden Reise.
__label__de	Du solltest etwas tun was Du magst.
__label__de	Halt jetzt an!
__label__de	Der alte Mantel hatte seine Zeit.
__label__de	Das Museum Rodin in Paris ist großartig.
__label__de	Sitz da nicht so rum!
__label__de	Habe ich Deine Erlaubnis fortzufahren?
__label__de	Der Präsident wünschte eine sofortige Handlung.
__label__de	Sie kaufte die Stiefel, die sie letztes Jahr auf dem Boot verloren hatte.
__label__de	Das war nicht Deine Intention, oder?
__label__de	Soll ich ein Geschenk mitbringen, wenn ich zum Abendessen eingeladen werde?
__label__de	Ich mache mich mit Leuten wie ihm nicht gemein.
__label__de	Was würdest Du tun, wenn Du eine Milliarde Dollar hättest?
__label__de	Ist der Cursor auf dem Bildschirm?
__label__de	Thomas hat sich die ganze Nacht übergeben.
__label__de	Es war einfach mit Tom zu sprechen.
__label__de	Können Sie mir zeigen, wo sich der Eingang zur Métro befindet?
__label__de	Ich möchte einige Länder besuchen wenn ich älter bin, und Amerika ist definitiv auf der Liste.
__label__de	Niemand zwingt Dich das zu tun.
__label__de	Außerirdische werden auf der Erde landen.
__label__de	Nach sieben Jahren Abwesenheit ging ich zurück zu mir.
__label__de	Möchtest Du ein Glas? Es steht eins auf dem Tisch.
__label__de	Ich möchte gerne Rechtsanwalt werden.
__label__de	Man hat ihr medizinisches Cannabis verschrieben, um die Nebenwirkungen der Chemotherapie abzumildern.
__label__de	Die Bauern sähen im Frühling das Getreide.
__label__de	Meine Katze war im Wipfel des Baumes gefangen.
__label__de	Wäre die Nase von Kleopatra kürzer gewesen, wäre die Geschichte der Welt anders verlaufen.
__label__de	Ich verließ die Feier zu früh.
__label__de	Tom besitzt eine kleine Farm unweit von Boston.
__label__de	Tom war einer guter Typ.
__label__de	Ich habe ihm viele Fragen zur Ökologie gestellt.
__label__de	Hilf ihm nicht!
__label__de	Eure Schule ist toll, da sie euch die Kosten für die Rückfahrkarten erstattet.
__label__de	Wie beim Menschen verschlechtert sich bei Hunden die Sicht, wenn sie älter werden.
__label__de	Nach vorne, lauft!
__label__de	Es wird Englisch in Australien gesprochen.
__label__de	Sie ging los, um ein Dreirad zu kaufen.
__label__de	Welcher Titel gefällt dir auf dem verkannten Debütalbum von Prefab Sprout am besten?
__label__de	Tom ist ein ungeduldiger Mann, oder?
__label__de	Wen werden Sie treffen?
__label__de	Du kannst die Wahrheit nicht begraben.
__label__de	Hör auf mir ins Ohr zu brüllen.
__label__de	Wir werden dem Komitee unsere Idee präsentieren.
__label__de	Es ist ein guter Plan, zumindest auf dem Papier.
__label__de	Der Ball klatschte gegen die Latte; der Torhüter hätte den nicht gekriegt.
__label__de	Sie haben Sorgen, oder?
__label__de	Sie zogen zwei Linien.
__label__de	Ich habe denen nicht alles gesagt.
__label__de	Direkt nachdem sie Feuer gefangen hatte, explodierte die chemische Fabrik.
__label__de	Das sieht ein bisschen schwer aus.
__label__de	Ich wüsste nicht, warum mich das überraschen sollte.
__label__de	Er ging schnurstracks zu einem Lokal, wo er etwas Gutes zu essen bekäme.
__label__de	Warum ist er zurück gekommen?
__label__de	Wie naiv ich war!
__label__de	Das Auto von Tom ist in Brand geraten.
__label__de	Die Haushaltskürzungen werden in der Abteilung zwangsläufig zu Reibereien führen.
__label__de	Es ist zuviel Zucker in meinem Tee.
__label__de	Was sind das für schöne Blumen!
__label__de	Bist Du flüssig?
__label__de	Ach, was für eine schöne Blume!
__label__de	Hat die irgend jemand dort gesehen?
__label__de	Er hat ihnen lange Zeit nicht mehr geschrieben.
__label__de	Ich denke, dass Tom sich selber vergiftet haben könnte.
__label__de	Ich weiß, dass Ihr gelangweilt seid.
__label__de	Ich wurde verbrannt.
__label__de	Lass uns eine schöne Tasse Tee trinken!
__label__de	Auf eigenen Beinen stehen heißt unabhängig sein.
__label__de	Sie wollen nur jemanden, den sie beschuldigen können.
__label__de	Wenn Mr. Jones alt wird, übergibt es sein Geschäft seinem Sohn.
__label__de	Gestern haben wir die Grenze überquert.
__label__de	Der Park wurde zum Wohne der Öffentlichkeit geschaffen.
__label__de	Du vermisst mich.
__label__de	Mama, ich möchte, dass du mir die Haare flichtst.
__label__de	Sami war ein erfolgreicher Geschäftsmann.
__label__de	Die Dinge liefen gut gestern Abend.
__label__de	Wie soll ich denn meine Medikamente nehmen, wenn du auf meiner Brust sitzt, Mutzi?
__label__de	Das hat mir ganz schön die Augen geöffnet.
__label__de	Sie traten durch einen Türdurchgang.
__label__de	Das Telefongespräch wurde unterbrochen.
__label__de	Sie sieht zu alt aus für eine Gymnasiastin.
__label__de	Letztlich haben sie etwas ganz anderes gezeichnet.
__label__de	Es waren nur Silhouetten am Horizont.
__label__de	Bist Du langweilig? Verzeihung, bist Du gelangweilt?
__label__de	Man muss viel riskieren, um zu gewinnen.
__label__de	Das hat mich schockiert.
__label__de	Obdachlosigkeit ist eine politische Entscheidung.
__label__de	Eines Tages werden wir verstehen.
__label__de	Maria tunnelte den Ball an Tom vorbei, nahm ihn wieder auf und spielte ihn Johannes zu, der auf das Tor zustürmte.
__label__de	Hast du schon einen Urlaub gebucht?
__label__de	Würden Sie uns sagen, welches die herausragendste Eigenschaft ist, die Sie besitzen?
__label__de	Du sprichst viel zu viel von ihm.
__label__de	Sie kann jetzt gerade nicht.
__label__de	Wurden Sie noch nie überrumpelt?
__label__de	Letzte Nacht war es drückend schwül.
__label__de	Sie gingen bei Rot auf die andere Straßenseite.
__label__de	Es wurde kein Titel in die Statue graviert.
__label__de	Ihr solltet wirklich ein neues Auto kaufen.
__label__de	Er bedauert seine Handlung.
__label__de	Diese Kirche stammt aus dem 13. Jahrhundert.
__label__de	Die Zeitlupenwiederholung zeigt zweifelsfrei, dass der Ball zur Gänze über die Linie gegangen ist.
__label__de	Ein großer Teil der Amerikaner liebt Sushi.
__label__de	Wir werden Euch beschützen.
__label__de	Man hat ein Auge drauf geworfen.
__label__de	Dieser Hund sprang.
__label__de	Ich könnte eine Tasse Tee vertragen.
__label__de	Marie wird morgen endlich mit dem Flugzeug abreisen.
__label__de	Wir sind die letzten.
__label__de	Er hat weder abgelehnt noch akzeptiert.
__label__de	Besuchst Du oft Deine Großeltern?
__label__de	Marie geht auf den Strich.
__label__de	Er ist zu süß!
__label__de	„Nein, nein und nein! Ich habe Euch gesagt, dass Ihr nicht alleine nach Paris fahrt.“ „Warum?“ „Ihr seid erst fünfzehn!“
__label__de	Seid Ihr bereit, die Wahrheit zu erfahren?
__label__de	Was Sie gesagt haben, hat für mich weder Hand noch Fuß.
__label__de	Sie öffnete das Fenster, um frische Luft ins Zimmer zu lassen.
__label__de	Sie öffnete das Fenster, damit frische Luft ins Zimmer kam.
__label__de	Es fing an, richtig zu regnen.
__label__de	Tante Hanna kommt diesmal nicht – vielleicht nächstesmal.
__label__de	Ich sehe deine, aber wo sind meine?
__label__de	Gib mir mal das Notizbuch da.
__label__de	Auf das Einlegekärtchen hatte sie hübsch die Titelliste gedruckt und ein Herz gezeichnet.
__label__de	Tom tut ein bisschen zu vornehm.
__label__de	Ich hoffe, dass du mich zu Ende anhörst.
__label__de	Die Ernte fiel der bitteren Kälte zum Opfer.
__label__de	Was für ein Baum ist eine Eiche?
__label__de	Die leben auf einem Kahn.
__label__de	Alles an ihm war grau.
__label__de	Was für ein völliger Scherbenhaufen!
__label__de	Ich bin zwar zur Prüfung angetreten, aber doch nur durchgefallen.
__label__de	Es fällt mir schwer, das, was du mir da erzählst, hinzunehmen.
__label__de	Aber nein, du musstest ja zum teureren Supermarkt fahren!
__label__de	„Kennst du die?“ – „Wir sind alle auf dieselbe Realschule gegangen.“
__label__de	Wenn der Chef einen „rausschmeißt“, heißt das, dass man entlassen ist.
__label__de	„Ich habe gestern Abend auf dem Sportplatz von der Ecke aus mit dem linken Fuß kopfüber ein Tor geschossen.“ – „Na klar! Träum weiter!“ – „Echt!“
__label__de	Sie trank ihren Tee mit einem Schluck halb aus.
__label__de	Ach, Sie müssen nur dieses Formular ausfüllen.
__label__de	Sind in dem Boot Ruder?
__label__de	Wir hatten ein altes Transistorradio mit einer Drahtkleiderbügelantenne.
__label__de	Sie hat sich sehr gefreut, ihren schon verloren geglaubten Geldbeutel wiedergefunden zu haben.
__label__de	Wir haben auf dem Sportplatz Fußball gespielt.
__label__de	Der Radschaufeldampfer fährt gerade aus dem Hafen.
__label__de	Sie sah sich die Armbanduhren an.
__label__de	City ist Tabellenführer, gefolgt von den Rovers auf dem zweiten Platz und Town auf dem dritten.
__label__de	Erzähl mir mal ein paar lustige Witze!
__label__de	Lass mal ein paar Brüller vom Stapel!
__label__de	Er ist ein Prominenter.
__label__de	Maria bekam trübe Augen, und ihr Blick schweifte über Toms Schulter, während der weiterredete.
__label__de	Sie trotteten über das büschlige Gras hoch auf einen Fußpfad.
__label__de	Dieses Jahr begannen in Edinburgh die Arbeiten an dem 15jährigen Erneuerungsprojekt zur Umgestaltung des Hafenviertels und zur Schaffung neuartigen Wohnraumes für die wachsende Bevölkerung.
__label__de	Kathi hat heute komische Laune. Das merke ich einfach.
__label__de	Ich habe gestern Abend Curry mit Reis gegessen.
__label__de	Gestern Abend gab es Curry.
__label__de	Heutzutage ist jeder glücklich und zufrieden.
__label__de	Die Chefin übertrug die Büroleitung während ihrer Abwesenheit Mr. Brown.
__label__de	Der Rechtsanwalt sprach überzeugend für seinen Mandanten.
__label__de	Nach der Vorschule kam ich in die Grundschule.
__label__de	So ein großes Haus hättest du doch nicht zu kaufen brauchen.
__label__de	Katzen schnurren nicht nur, wenn sie zufrieden sind, sondern auch zu anderen Gelegenheiten.
__label__de	Rate mal, was passiert ist! Ich habe einen Studienplatz bekommen!
__label__de	Die jungen Zelter waren mit neuen wasserdichten Jacken ausgestattet.
__label__de	Der Premierminister kündigte an, in einigen Wochen zurücktreten zu wollen.
__label__de	Tom war weder geneigt, über etwas Interessantes zu schreiben, noch war ihm auch nur die geringste Sprachgewandtheit zu eigen, aber viel zu schreiben, das gelang ihm, und das, so dachte er bei sich, müsse ja auch etwas wert sein.
__label__de	Wir plauderten bei einer Tasse Tee.
__label__de	Dieser Film ist ein Drama.
__label__de	Ich verbringe etwas Zeit mit Tom.
__label__de	Ich treffe mich oft mit Tom.
__label__de	Das war die einzige Kategorie, die passte.
__label__de	In Großbritannien spielen die Fußballklubs traditionell eine wichtige Rolle in den Gemeinden, denen sie ihre Existenz verdanken.
__label__de	„Nein, das kannst du selber saubermachen! Ich bin nicht deine Dienstmagd!“ sagte sie.
__label__de	Sie kümmert sich um sie.
__label__de	Haben Sie einen Reiseführer für diese Stadt?
__label__de	Sie gab Tom den Welpen auf den Arm und ging zum Pub.
__label__de	Hast du dich mal hingesetzt und mit ihm gesprochen?
__label__de	In dem Roman „Red Shift“ („Rotverschiebung“) von Alan Garner wird Jan von Tom gebeten, jeden Abend um 22 Uhr zum Stern δ Orionis zu blicken.
__label__de	Ach, ich kann meinen roten Rock ja gar nicht anziehen; der ist ja in der Wäsche.
__label__de	Ich werde dir mein Buch leihen.
__label__de	Ich werde euch mein Buch leihen.
__label__de	Ich werde Ihnen mein Buch leihen.
__label__de	Er trank Bier sowie eine Flasche Whisky.
__label__de	Dass aus zwei Menschen, die sich einst so liebten, so erbitterte Feinde werden können ...
__label__de	Alles Gute, was die Leute über einen hören, hinterfragen sie, alles Schlechte aber glauben sie aufs Wort.
__label__de	Ich bin Marias Verlobter.
__label__de	Herrn Kimura habe ich in letzter Zeit gar nicht gesehen.
__label__de	Sie war nur mit ihm zusammen, weil sie einen Lückenbüßer brauchte.
__label__de	Die Beweise sind glaubwürdig.
__label__de	Sie hat ihr Abitur mit Bravour bestanden.
__label__de	Als er den Witz gehört hatte, brach er in Gelächter aus.
__label__de	Ich habe mit Zweigen ein Feuer entfacht.
__label__de	Kommenden April steigen die Gebühren der öffentlichen Versorgungsbetriebe.
__label__de	Maria hat melassefarbenes Haar.
__label__de	Wir hörten, wie sich mit kommender Flut brechende Wellen näherten.
__label__de	Als wir das Haus verließen, regnete es in Strömen.
__label__de	Tom ging zum Laden an der Ecke, um sich eine Sonntagszeitung zu kaufen.
__label__de	Als ich heute Morgen durch Nebel und Eis spazierte, flog mir ein Reiher über den Kopf hinweg.
__label__de	Toms Redlichkeit wurde vom Arbeitgeber in Frage gestellt.
__label__de	Lass uns die Hauptstraße entlanggehen.
__label__de	Lasst uns die Hauptstraße entlanggehen.
__label__de	Lassen Sie uns die Hauptstraße entlanggehen.
__label__de	City fand erst spät ins Spiel zurück und erzielte in der Nachspielzeit einen Ausgleichstreffer.
__label__de	Die besten Köche sind Männer, aber die besten Köchinnen sind Frauen.
__label__de	Auf dem Pfade schimmerten Flecken Sonnenlichts.
__label__de	Ich kann meine Verwandten nicht erreichen.
__label__de	Aus Dreck wird Gold gemacht.
__label__de	Ich bin die beste Köchin der Welt!
__label__de	Ich bin der beste Koch der Welt!
__label__de	Er hat die hinters Licht geführt.
__label__de	Sie gingen zwischen den tiefhängenden Zweigen der Bäume entlang.
__label__de	Ist Tom ein Geschäftsmann?
__label__de	Sie standen unter dem Zauberbann der Nacht.
__label__de	Ich konnte vor meinem Wagen eine Ampel sehen.
__label__de	Wir haben uns ganz schön darüber gestritten.
__label__de	Die hat Nerven, sich allein mit ihm zu treffen!
__label__de	Kann Edinburgh uns den Weg zu gesünderen Städten hin weisen?
__label__de	Sie hat viele Stunden in der Hängematte auf der faulen Haut gelegen.
__label__de	Ihre Ehe ist gescheitert.
__label__de	Sie hat viele Stunden, in der Hängematte liegend, vertrödelt.
__label__de	Sieh mal! Da ist er.
__label__de	„Mancunians“ kommen aus Manchester, „Glaswegians“ aus Glasgow und „Brummies“ aus Birmingham.
__label__de	Dieses Jahr ist die Mode anders als im letzten.
__label__de	Er ist seit seiner Krankheit noch immer in schlechter Verfassung.
__label__de	Inwieweit können wir ihm vertrauen?
__label__de	Auf der Nordlinie (Northern Line) kommt es aufgrund von Bauarbeiten zu Verzögerungen.
__label__de	Welches gehört ihr?
__label__de	Welcher gehört ihr?
__label__de	Welche gehört ihr?
__label__de	Es sind auch andere Namen immer wieder gefallen.
__label__de	Sie ist irgendwo unterwegs.
__label__de	Zwischen den unebenen Gehwegplatten wächst ungehindert Gras.
__label__de	Am Bahnhof wimmelte es von Reisenden.
__label__de	Sie hatte nur ein bisschen gegessen, bevor sie den Tisch verließ.
__label__de	Du hast dazu wohl nichts zu sagen?
__label__de	Sie kommt noch nicht.
__label__de	Die ungarische Mannschaft scheiterte an England mit 3 : 6.
__label__de	Man muss fairnesshalber sagen, dass Tom nie behauptet hat, so viele Spaghetti auf einmal essen zu können.
__label__de	Auf Anhieb fällt mir das Datum nicht ein.
__label__de	Im Laufe der nächsten 15 Jahre werden Architekten, Planer und Gemeindeentwickler gemeinsam daran arbeiten, 140 Hektar Industriebrache in 6500 Wohnhäuser, zwei Einkaufszentren, einen Jachthafen, eine Grund- und weiterführende Schule und Parklandschaft zu verwandeln.
__label__de	Ich ging in dem Augenblick gerade auf den Bahnhof zu.
__label__de	Heute Morgen gab es starken Frost.
__label__de	Der Doktor ist da drüben.
__label__de	Du magst keine Schlager, oder?
__label__de	Ich hasse den Fraß in der Mensa.
__label__de	Nein, das ist das Mindeste, was ich tun kann.
__label__de	Firmen werden sich bald nach anderen Lösungen umsehen.
__label__de	Tom fuhr auf der U-Bahn-Rolltreppe in entgegengesetzter Richtung an Maria vorbei.
__label__de	Das Labor läuft auf Sparflamme.
__label__de	Sie warf ihm einen Blick zu.
__label__de	Der öffentliche Unmut gegen die Luftverschmutzung hat endlich eine Stimme bekommen.
__label__de	Das Brot wurde schimmelig.
__label__de	Bemüh dich nicht! Sie sind schon da.
__label__de	Am Straßenrand lag eine tote Spitzmaus.
__label__de	Keine zwei sind gleich.
__label__de	Es gleicht keines einem anderen.
__label__de	Alle diese Eichhörnchenfiguren sind Unikate. Es gleich keine einer anderen.
__label__de	Fußballer tragen Schienbeinschützer.
__label__de	Der Fahrplan geriet durcheinander.
__label__de	Ich weiß schon gar nicht mehr, was mich veranlasst hat, das zu schreiben.
__label__de	Ihr Lächeln konnte die Enttäuschung über die geringe Teilnahme nicht verbergen.
__label__de	Sie hat den Vorteil, zweisprachig zu sein.
__label__de	Er ist gelaufen.
__label__de	Das ist vergebliche Müh’.
__label__de	Er hat sich schon mit seinem allerersten Roman einen Namen als Schriftsteller gemacht.
__label__de	Der Mond versank am Nachthimmel.
__label__de	Ich habe ihn mit dem Telefon am Ohr auf dem Bürgersteig vor seinem Haus auf- und abgehen sehen.
__label__de	Es gibt kein Patentrezept.
__label__de	Er ist für diese Aufgabe genau der Richtige.
__label__de	Was gibt es bei dir zum Abendessen?
__label__de	Der Zug ist früh dran.
__label__de	Die sind mit dem Wohnwagen in den Familienurlaub gefahren.
__label__de	Es ist etwas frisch.
__label__de	Das ist zuviel Aufwand.
__label__de	Wir haben vierundvierzig Gäste.
__label__de	Hinter dem nächsten Gebäude befand sich ein Getreidespeicher.
__label__de	Er hat körperlichen und seelischen Schmerz erdulden müssen.
__label__de	Der Torhüter war bereit, den Schuss zu parieren, doch der Ball flog weit am Pfosten vorbei.
__label__de	Mit Herrn Soarez bin ich schon seit Jahren eng befreundet.
__label__de	Das liegt daran, dass das zweite Kleid billiger war.
__label__de	Sieh mal, was ich in deinem Kleiderschrank für einen schönen Kaschmirpullover gefunden habe!
__label__de	Die sind vorübergehend irgendwo untergekommen.
__label__de	Die wohnen in einer vorübergehenden Unterkunft.
__label__de	Maria hat ihr Stichwort verpasst.
__label__de	Wenn du rennst, holst du ihn bald ein.
__label__de	Man kann nur abwarten.
__label__de	Ich treffe mich heute Nachmittag mit Mr. Brown in seinem Büro.
__label__de	Sorgen Sie dafür, dass man sich angemessen um die Kranken kümmert.
__label__de	Das ist ein großer Tisch.
__label__de	Ruh dich doch ein bisschen aus!
__label__de	Katika kann nicht lesen!
__label__de	Kitti kann noch nicht lesen.
__label__de	Tom kann noch immer nicht lesen.
__label__de	Das Internet verbindet Menschen aus der ganzen Welt.
__label__de	Das Haus sieht unbewohnt aus.
__label__de	Du musst deine Pflichten erfüllen.
__label__de	Iss dein Krüppelgemüse!
__label__de	Ihr Vater brachte das Ruderboot zur Bootswerft, um es reparieren zu lassen.
__label__de	Er wollte sich in den Verein einkaufen.
__label__de	Da er krank war, waren sie still.
__label__de	Ich habe dieses Buch zum Sonderpreis bekommen.
__label__de	Hört mit der Fachsimpelei auf!
__label__de	Auf der Dorfwiese verkauft jemand köstliche selbstgemachte Limonade.
__label__de	In der einen Hand hatte sie eine Taschenlampe, in der anderen einen verstellbaren Schraubenschlüssel.
__label__de	In der einen Hand hatte sie eine Taschenlampe, in der anderen einen Engländer.
__label__de	Durham ist eine Stadt am Flusse Wear.
__label__de	Durham ist eine Stadt, die am Flusse Wear liegt.
__label__de	Sie hätte nicht schweigen müssen.
__label__de	Draußen ist es kühl geworden.
__label__de	Mein Freund ist mit vielen Frauen befreundet.
__label__de	Tom schaut anderen Weibern hinterher, und das gefällt seiner Freundin Angelika nicht.
__label__de	Immer, wenn sich die Gelegenheit zum Fremdgehen bietet, nimmt Tom sie wahr.
__label__de	Kaum dass ihm seine Freundin in großer Versöhnung den letzten Seitensprung verziehen hatte, lag Tom schon wieder mit einer anderen im Bett.
__label__de	„Gib mir noch eine Chance!“ – „Nein, es ist endgültig aus zwischen uns.“
__label__de	Dir fehlt das, was in deinem Alter am wichtigsten ist: Liebe.
__label__de	Hallo, geht es euch allen gut?
__label__de	Niemand hat es leicht.
__label__de	Glaube mir! Ich habe das alles schon erlebt.
__label__de	Der Boden ist feucht, nachdem es geregnet hat.
__label__de	Durch das Fenster zieht es.
__label__de	Wir kamen gerade von der Probe zurück.
__label__de	Einige davon sind möglicherweise langsamer, als du denkst.
__label__de	Er hat seinen Gegner übermannt.
__label__de	Sein nachfolgendes Album war weniger erfolgreich als sein erstes.
__label__de	Tom ist derzeit angesagt.
__label__de	Hör mit der Miesepeterei auf!
__label__de	Weißt du, was die dichtmachen?
__label__de	Weißt du, wann es schließt?
__label__de	Getreide wurde billiger.
__label__de	„Steh auf!“ – „Ich bin auf!“
__label__de	Die Berge waren im Dunst verschwunden.
__label__de	Die offizielle Straßenverkehrsordnung wurde in Großbritannien erstmals 1931 herausgegeben.
__label__de	Max, Lee und Céline suchten einen Tisch, an dem man sitzen konnte, während Sam und Robin zur Bar gingen, um die Getränke zu holen.
__label__de	Das Spalier war mit Heckenkirschen bewachsen.
__label__de	„Willst du nicht zur Schule, um die Ergebnisse deine Abschlussprüfung einzusehen? Alle anderen werden auch dort sein.“ – „Ebendeswegen gehe ich nicht. Ich warte, bis sie mit der Post kommen.“
__label__de	Sie waren über ihre Reisepläne ganz aus dem Häuschen.
__label__de	Fußballanhänger haben die Vorschläge mit Hohn und Spott überschüttet.
__label__de	In den kommenden Stunden wird ein Sturm über die Bretagne hereinbrechen.
__label__de	„Sonntags durfte ich den Plattenspieler meine Mutter benutzen“, sagte sie. „Ich spielte von ihr die Beatles und die Small Faces und von mir Madness und Kate Bush, bis mein Vater aus der Kneipe nach Hause kam.“
__label__de	Es wirkt etwas feudalistisch, ihn „Sir“ zu nennen.
__label__de	Es werden überall Hochhäuser gebaut.
__label__de	Der Sprühnebel der Wellen unten kam hoch bis auf die Klippen.
__label__de	Er wägt seine Worte nicht ab.
__label__de	Nachdem sie alle Samen gepflanzt hatte, stand sie im warmen Frühlingssonnenschein auf, schloss die Augen und wischte sich die Stirn.
__label__de	Diese Äpfel kann man gut kochen.
__label__de	Das ist für mich ein Riesenschock.
__label__de	Emilie reist reist heute Morgen aus Paris ab.
__label__de	Die Wolken da verheißen nichts Gutes.
__label__de	Wir befinden ihn für nicht schuldig.
__label__de	Inzwischen ist sie bestimmt im Dorf angekommen.
__label__de	Ganz so wie jetzt war es nie.
__label__de	Warum bist du mir schon seit einer Woche so gram?
__label__de	Sie schien unter Zeitdruck zu stehen und blickte immer wieder zur Uhr an der Wand.
__label__de	Wir gehen aus dem Fahrstuhl.
__label__de	Anton überlegte, was er sonst noch in den Einkaufswagen legen konnte, damit die Schnapsflaschen nicht so auffielen.
__label__de	Ich habe absichtlich keine Namen erwähnt.
__label__de	Sie sind uns zu jeder Zeit willkommen!
__label__de	Du bist uns zu jeder Zeit willkommen!
__label__de	Ihr seid uns zu jeder Zeit willkommen!
__label__de	Wir haben nichts anderes.
__label__de	Schmecken diese Speisen gut?
__label__de	Er beginnt zu begreifen.
__label__de	Tom liebt Marias Kinder.
__label__de	Ich werde sie Ihnen morgen zurückbringen.
__label__de	Sie hat auch nicht geschrieben.
__label__de	Tom hat Marias Kinder sehr gern.
__label__de	Willst du diese Armbanduhr reparieren lassen?
__label__de	Wir verkaufen dieses Buch zu einem Sonderpreis.
__label__de	Ich kann den ganzen Lärm auf der Straße nicht ertragen.
__label__de	Er betonte, wie wichtig es sei, pünktlich zu sein.
__label__de	Es gelang dem Premierminister nicht, ein Kabinett zu bilden.
__label__de	In einem Holzschächtelchen in einer Schublade bewahrte sie ein verblichenes Farbfoto ihres Vaters auf, wie er, sich mit ausgestreckten Armen nach vorne lehnend, in seinem Ruderboot saß, in den Händen fest die Ruder.
__label__de	In auswärtigen Angelegenheiten ist er wohlbewandert.
__label__de	Ich habe zwei Gläser Bier getrunken.
__label__de	Sie hat das Abitur in der Oberstufe ihrer Schule abgelegt, er hingegen in Abendkursen an der Volkshochschule.
__label__de	Man bekommt einfach kein Personal.
__label__de	Sie hat sich damit abgefunden, dort zu wohnen.

__label__de	Der Linsenbraten war umwerfend, Tom.

__label__de	Auxerre feierte den ersten Saisonsieg und kletterte damit aus der Abstiegszone.
__label__de	Der Fußballverein Preston North End wurde 1889 als erster englischer Meister.
__label__de	Seine Erklärung klang nicht überzeugend.
__label__de	Das Vorhaben wurde vereitelt.
__label__de	Er hebt sich von den Malern seiner Zeit ab.
__label__de	Er stellte sich krank, um nicht zur Schule gehen zu müssen.
__label__de	Der Unfall war auf ein schlechtes Fahrverhalten zurückzuführen.
__label__de	Obwohl der Lerndruck an der Universität Cambridge sehr hoch ist, haben viele Studenten dennoch Zeit, auszugehen und sich zu amüsieren.
__label__de	Der Dollar hat sich nach einem Einbruch stabilisiert.
__label__de	Für eine 500 Kilogramm schwere Batterie eines Elektroautos müssen 200 Tonnen Erde bewegt werden.
__label__de	Damit alles so bleibt, wie es ist, muss sich alles ändern.
__label__de	Ich traue mich nicht, nach Hause zu gehen.
__label__de	Ich bin nicht darauf gekommen, was dieses Geräusch verursacht.
__label__de	Nicht dein Geld brauche ich, sondern dich.
__label__de	Mein Hund bellt mich nicht mehr an.
__label__de	Ich brauche nicht dein Geld, sondern dich.
__label__de	Er konnte es kaum erwartem, mit der Schule fertig zu werden und seinen eigenen Weg in der Welt zu gehen.
__label__de	Die Küche ist nicht sauber.
__label__de	Der Elefant ist groß.
__label__de	Diesen Kommentaren nach zu urteilen, scheint es, dass dieser Satz korrigiert werden sollte.
__label__de	Ich verkaufe überhaupt nichts.
__label__de	Ich werde morgen wieder auf den Beinen sein.
__label__de	Hat Sie das wütend gemacht?
__label__de	Dieser Brief wurde entsiegelt.
__label__de	Sagen Sie uns Ihre Meinung!
__label__de	Wer hat dir diese Äpfel gegeben?
__label__de	Sesam, schließe dich!
__label__de	Gab’s im Kiosk noch den „Melody Maker“?
__label__de	Er hat dieses Semester kaum gelernt.
__label__de	Er spuckte das Essen aus.
__label__de	Sie hatten einige Jahre gelebt, wo es sich ergab, Wohnung, Bad und Küche mit anderen geteilt.
__label__de	Der Gesetzentwurf ist von beiden Kammern angenommen worden.
__label__de	Wir sollten vorher reservieren lassen.
__label__de	Tom strahlt eine gewisse Autorität aus.
__label__de	Die Dokumentation war verhalten und wich einigen wesentlichen Fragen aus.
__label__de	Es kommt heute zu mitunter gewittrigen Regenschauern.
__label__de	„Sieht aus, als stünde uns ein ganz schönes Dreckwetter bevor.“ – „Das kannst du laut sagen, Bruder.“
__label__de	Was für ein Dreckhaufen!
__label__de	Was für ein Dreckhaufen diese Arbeiter sind! Die kriegen nichts gebacken!
__label__de	Es ist gerade zwanzig nach eins geworden.
__label__de	Tatsache ist, dass sie krank ist.
__label__de	Quatsch mit Soße!
__label__de	So ’n Blech!
__label__de	Der Fluss mündet in einen See.
__label__de	Ich habe sie kennengelernt.
__label__de	Der Autobau wird statt von menschlichen Arbeitern von computerprogrammierten Robotern ausgeführt.
__label__de	„Toms Shepherd’s pie würde ich nicht einmal mit Handschuhen anfassen“, schnaubte Maria.
__label__de	Schick mir welche!
__label__de	Es war die beste Zeit; es war die schlechteste Zeit.
__label__de	Der Regen geht in einen Mix aus Sonnenschein und stürmischen Schauern über.
__label__de	Er war diesbezüglich sehr deutlich.
__label__de	An den zugigen Fenstern rann Kondenswasser herunter.
__label__de	Da fällt mir was ein.
__label__de	Nicht lange, nachdem ich mich angestellt hatte, näherte sich mir ein Mann und fragte, ob ich ein Taxi wolle.
__label__de	Sie kletterte in das Ruderboot, hielt sich im Gleichgewicht, während es schwankte, und legte ab.
__label__de	Genug geredet! Sehen und hören wir jetzt zu!
__label__de	Kannst du dir Tom in einer Autowerkstatt arbeitend vorstellen?
__label__de	In japanischen Wagen sitzt der Fahrer rechts.
__label__de	Ich habe im Supermarkt eine Tüte Milch gekauft.
__label__de	Du willst dein Geld doch wohl nicht an diesem Spielautomaten verzocken, oder etwa doch?
__label__de	Nach dem Regen ist es draußen frisch.
__label__de	Millie liebt ihn.
__label__de	Hast du dein Fahrrad?
__label__de	Zu ebendiesem Zweck entwickelt man Programme zum Publizieren vom Schreibtisch aus.
__label__de	Tom gibt immer an.
__label__de	Tom und Maria haben einen draufgemacht.
__label__de	Coventry war im Herzen der 2-Tone-Szene.
__label__de	Komm so früh wie möglich.
__label__de	Sie nimmt an einem Fitnessprogramm teil.
__label__de	Ich weiß nicht mehr, wie die Geschichte ausging.
__label__de	Ich weiß nicht mehr, wie alles ausging.
__label__de	Es ist ein bisschen eng hier, findest du nicht?
__label__de	Der Bus setzt Sie oben an der Avalon-Allee ab, von wo aus Sie im Bogen den Hügel runter der Straße folgen, bis diese in die Gawain-Straße mündet.
__label__de	Ich hörte den Donner, aber sah nicht den Blitz.
__label__de	Es ist schon wieder „fröhliche Stunde“.
__label__de	Mir schwoll bei seiner egoistischen Einstellung der Kamm.
__label__de	Er langte nach seinem Seidel.
__label__de	Ich weiß was.
__label__de	Ich finde dich chic.
__label__de	„Man sagt, den besten Pub der Welt soll es in Glasgow geben.“ – „Ach, sagt man das jetzt?“ – „So habe ich’s gehört.“
__label__de	Wenn man sich frühzeitig die richtigen Methoden zurechtlegt, kann man auf lange Sicht viel Zeit sparen.
__label__de	Er band das Paket zu.
__label__de	Arbeitet sie in einer Gruppe?
__label__de	Welche Bahnhöfe bedienen den Norden?
__label__de	Eine enge Straße nach der anderen mit Reihenhäusern umgibt die Fabrik.
__label__de	Sie hatten einen Duft von Meeresluft im Haar.
__label__de	Du aufgeblasener Wichigtuer!
__label__de	Kann ich einen Platz in der ersten Reihe haben?
__label__de	Wir hatten heute Morgen unser erstes Mahl, und es war essbar; dafür sind wir erst mal dankbar.
__label__de	Sally wandte sich an Mr. Taylor.
__label__de	Dein Zimmer sieht aus, als hätte eine Bombe eingeschlagen!
__label__de	Sally besuchte Mr. Taylor.
__label__de	Welche Sprache das ist, weiß ich nicht. Vermutlich Deutsch?
__label__de	Das Resultat ist das gleiche.
__label__de	Ich habe zwei Männer sich auf offener Straße küssen sehen – auf den Mund!
__label__de	Tigerlilien blühten im Garten.
__label__de	Im Garten blühten Tigerlilien.
__label__de	Sie arbeitet gern in einer Gruppe.
__label__de	Die Welt beginnt und endet nicht mit den sozialen Medien.
__label__de	Das Tor schleifte auf dem Boden, als es aufgestoßen wurde.
__label__de	Er hat sein Abitur mit fliegenden Fahnen bestanden.
__label__de	Aber wie hast du es geschafft, uns zu erkennen?
__label__de	Gib nie auf!
__label__de	Tom würde es tun.
__label__de	Die Tür zum Haus ist geschlossen. Die Fenster sind jedoch geöffnet.
__label__de	Die Tür zum Haus ist geschlossen, aber die Fenster sind offen.
__label__de	Wer hat es erfunden?
__label__de	Der Student hat eine eigene Website.
__label__de	Der Student hat seine eigene Website.
__label__de	Ich bestelle kein Essen.
__label__de	Bleiben Sie rechts.
__label__de	Der Mann, den ich gestern getroffen habe, war Herr Hill.
__label__de	Wir haben ihn gerade erst gesehen.
__label__de	Tom scheint verstört zu sein.
__label__de	Bleib auf der linken Spur.
__label__de	Tschüssli Müsli!
__label__de	Tschö mit ö!
__label__de	Gestern war ich mit ihr zusammen.
__label__de	Dieser Name ist mir bekannt.
__label__de	Was bedeutet dieser Name?
__label__de	Gestern war sie noch kerngesund.
__label__de	Warum hast du mich geschlagen?
__label__de	Ich fand einen Topf, in dem mehrere alte Münzen lagen.
__label__de	Iss und trink, was du willst!
__label__de	Wo ist der Kiefernwald?
__label__de	Welches ist dein Lieblingsmusiklokal?
__label__de	Ich glaube, das bezeichnet man als Porree.
__label__de	Gleich vor dem Fenster war eine Bushaltestelle, wo den ganzen Tag Leute warteten und in Busse ein- und ausstiegen.
__label__de	Ich will Hawaiisch lernen.
__label__de	„Gordon, ein schnelles Wort.“ – „Geschwindigkeit.“
__label__de	Der Fluss überflutete die ganze Gegend.
__label__de	Dass man draußen an der frischen Luft sein kann, ist einer der Höhepunkte des Berufs.
__label__de	Der Torhüter behielt eine weiße Weste.
__label__de	Der Torhüter hielt den Kasten sauber.
__label__de	Warum haust du mich?
__label__de	Es gibt ein Gesetz, das verbietet, Abfall achtlos wegzuwerfen, aber dem wird selten Geltung verschafft.
__label__de	Tom ist ja nicht bescheuert.
__label__de	Lassen wir die Förmlichkeiten ruhig sein!
__label__de	Der Wind wird heute veränderlich sein.
__label__de	Nach einer weiteren Heimniederlage schleppten sich die Fans des Gastgebers aus dem Stadion.
__label__de	Du musst mal auf einen Plausch bei uns vorbeikommen!
__label__de	Sie wohnen in einer vorläufigen Unterkunft.
__label__de	Die Fenster meines Zimmers weisen zum Hof hin.
__label__de	Der Ball klatschte an die Latte, während der Torwart wie angewurzelt stehenblieb.
__label__de	Sein plötzliches Auftauchen war ihr peinlich.
__label__de	Auf der anderen Straßenseite ankommend, stolperte Tom über den Bordstein und fiel der Länge nach auf den Bürgersteig.
__label__de	Lerne ein Gewerbe!
__label__de	Er setzt sich für eine Reform des Universitätsstudiums ein.
__label__de	Bring mich weg!
__label__de	In den heruntergekommenen Lagerhäusern am Kai fanden sonst immer Technopartys statt.
__label__de	Die Eberesche bezeichnet man auch manchmal als Vogelbeerbaum.
__label__de	Daraufhin stand er auf und ging raus.
__label__de	„Ach, das ist eine gute Idee!“ sagte sie.
__label__de	Tom legt im eigenen Schlafzimmer Platten auf.
__label__de	In ebendiesem Augenblick macht er irgendwo in einer Marktstadt Straßenmusik.
__label__de	Heute Nacht kommt es vielerorts zu Frost.
__label__de	Wir brachen auf, als der Regen nachgelassen hatte.
__label__de	Marias Musikgruppe hat die erste Single selbst finanziert.
__label__de	Alles sieht toll aus.
__label__de	Der Paraguayer erzielte drei Tore.
__label__de	„Gefällt er dir?“ – „Der ist irgendwie zu vornehm.“ – „Der ist nicht vornehm! Der hat nur gepflegtes Haar und weiß sich auszudrücken.
__label__de	Ella steuerte auf einem Kurs durch das Asteroidenfeld.
__label__de	Plötzlich wirbelte ein Windstoß die Oberfläche des Teiches auf.
__label__de	Die Straße fällt plötzlich ab.
__label__de	Wer Englisch kann, der muss keine andere Sprache können.
__label__de	Ich muss irgendwo falsch abgebogen sein.
__label__de	Wie viele muss ich machen?
__label__de	Iss und trink, was immer du willst!
__label__de	Tom, du bist völlig meschugge.
__label__de	Reparierst du es?
__label__de	Die orangeroten Beeren der Eberesche sind nicht giftig und essbar.
__label__de	Der Schauspieler wird in weniger als einer halben Stunde fünf Figuren spielen.
__label__de	Sie weiß nicht, welchen Titel das Buch, von dem du redest, hat.
__label__de	Er arbeitete hinter dem Tresen.
__label__de	Ich sehe, dass er noch schläft.
__label__de	Unsere Schule ist in die Sommerferien gegangen.
__label__de	Es gibt keinen Grund, darauf zu bestehen.
__label__de	Sie traten durch einen Torbogen.
__label__de	Lass mich sofort los!
__label__de	Lasst mich sofort los!
__label__de	Lassen Sie mich sofort los!
__label__de	Auf den Straßen war der Bär los, als alle aus dem Saal kamen.
__label__de	„Da sieh mal einer an, wer da kommt!“ Sie stand oben auf der Treppe zur Bibliothek und hielt eine Heftmappe umklammert. „Da tritt er blinzelnd ins Sonnenlicht hervor! Nach gestern Abend hätte ich gedacht, du würdest dich – ach, was weiß ich – wenigstens ein paar Tage nicht mehr blicken lassen!“ – „Hör mir auf!“ seufzte er und schleppte sich, die Treppe hoch, an ihr vorbei.
__label__de	Dieser Junge! Der frisst mir noch mal die Haare vom Kopf!
__label__de	Hohe Kiefern bilden einen Ring um den See herum.
__label__de	Die Brücke ist wegen erforderlicher Reparaturen gesperrt.
__label__de	Komm schon, spuck’s aus!
__label__de	Treffen Sie sich mit so wenigen wie möglich, damit sich die Seuche nicht noch weiter ausbreitet!
__label__de	Als ich am Bahnhof ankam, lief der Eilzug soeben ein.
__label__de	Der Kandidat führte, wenn auch keinen umfangreichen, so doch einen raffinierten Wahlkampf und errang somit einen überzeugenden Sieg.
__label__de	Tom und Maria verbrachten das Wochenende damit, auf den Kinder Scout im Peak District zu kraxeln und wieder herab.
__label__de	Es gibt eine Regel für die und für den Rest von uns eine andere.
__label__de	Die haben also nichts füreinander übrig?
__label__de	Ich bemerkte es, ebenweil ich in ihre Richtung sah.
__label__de	Dr. Beeching hat für einiges Rechenschaft abzulegen.
__label__de	Leg sonst nichts in den Kofferraum!
__label__de	Zu Hause ist es hundekalt.
__label__de	Ich rief seinen Vertreter an.
__label__de	Wir waren gestern im Kino. Wir haben uns „Krieg der Sterne“ angesehen.
__label__de	Die Rovers haben den Aufstieg geschafft.
__label__de	In seinen Privatunterlagen enthalten ist ein Tagebuch über sein erstes Parlamentsjahr.
__label__de	Zu Hause ist eine Hundekälte.
__label__de	Superman kann Eisen verbiegen.
__label__de	Was sind Vögel?
__label__de	Dass man aus Vogelbeeren Konfitüre kochen kann, hat mich überrascht. Es hieß immer, die Früchte seien giftig. Überraschend ist auch, dass diese im botanischen Sinne eigentlich keine Beeren, sondern Äpfel sind.
__label__de	Oft sind Früchte, die volkstümlich als Beeren bezeichnet werden, gar keine.
__label__de	Als seine neue Herzensflamme Tom Vogelbeermarmelade zu probieren gab, war dieser zunächst misstrauisch, denn als Kind war ihm immer gesagt worden, Vogelbeeren seien giftig.
__label__de	Kurz lautet die Antwort: „Nein.“ Das ist schon seit 2015 Thema.
__label__de	Lies bitte unsere „Regeln und Richtlinien“.
__label__de	Der Google-Übersetzer identifiziert diese Sprache als Weißrussisch.
__label__de	Jemand, der ein Fernsehprogramm für sich sucht, könnte sagen: „Es kommt nichts Gescheites.“
__label__de	Was bedeutet das, und in was für einer Situation würdest du das sagen?
__label__de	Mir gefällt diese Erklärung von Tom, und ich stimme der zumindest teilweise zu.
__label__de	Ich liebe Holundersaft.
__label__de	Maria ist eine sehr elegante Frau.
__label__de	Der Karakal ist ein sehr elegantes Tier.
__label__de	Der Elefant ist ein großes Tier.
__label__de	Der Elefant ist ein sehr großes Tier.
__label__de	Es war niemand da, der Englisch sprach, so dass sich Tom auf seine Latein- und Altgriechischkenntnisse verlassen musste.
__label__de	Es war niemand da, der Englisch sprach, aber alle sprachen kurioserweise Esperanto.
__label__de	Sie gingen eingehakt die Allee entlang.
__label__de	Der Fußweg wandt sich durch offene Felder.
__label__de	„Brillant!“ sagte sie, sarkastisch klatschend, nachdem er fertig war.
__label__de	Volle Fahrt voraus!
__label__de	Er flippt aus, wenn er das sieht.
__label__de	Sei nicht lieblos.
__label__de	Wie viele Teller und Tassen sind da?
__label__de	„Bist du im Wohnzimmer schon mit Streichen fertig?“ – „Nein, ich muss die Sockelleisten noch machen.“
__label__de	Was ist denn eigentlich ein Verein? Nicht die Gebäude oder die Direktoren oder die Leute, die dafür bezahlt werden, ihn zu repräsentieren; nicht die Fernsehverträge, Ausstiegsklauseln, Vertriebsabteilungen oder Führungslogen; nein, es ist der Lärm, die Leidenschaft, das Zugehörigkeitsgefühl, der Stolz auf unsere Stadt; ein kleiner Junge, der zum allerersten Mal, sich an der Hand seines Vaters festhaltend, die Stufen des Stadions erklimmt und hinunterblickt auf den heiligen Rasen, der sich unter ihm erstreckt, und sich, ohne etwas dagegen tun zu können, verliebt.
__label__de	Warum machst du dich nicht selbständig?
__label__de	Er kommt ins Krankenhaus.
__label__de	Tom hat dein Fahrrad mitgehen lassen.
__label__de	Tom hat dein Fahrrad geklaut.
__label__de	Es soll im Abnehmen begriffen sein, aber es hat noch immer etwas, oder?
__label__de	Der Horizont war von Morgennebel verhangen.
__label__de	Eine Gruppe von Freunden, ein paar Arm in Arm, kam, sich unterhaltend, auf ruhiger Abendstraße dahergeschritten.
__label__de	Es regnete uns ins Gesicht.
__label__de	Der Regen wehte uns ins Gesicht.
__label__de	„Chicken tikka masala“ ist inzwischen ein durch und durch britisches Nationalgericht, und das liegt nicht nur daran, dass es das beliebteste ist, sondern auch daran, dass es ein perfektes Beispiel dafür abgibt, wie man in Großbritannien Fremdes sich zu eigen zu machen und weiterzuentwickeln pflegt: „Chicken tikka“ ist nämlich ein indisches Gericht, und die Masala-Sauce wurde hinzugefügt, um dem Verlangen des britischen Volkes Genüge zu tun, Fleisch in Bratensaft serviert zu bekommen.
__label__de	Meine Mutter hat mir einen Weihnachtskuchen gebacken.
__label__de	Auf dem Weg lag überall Laub herum.
__label__de	Tom hielt sich mit einer Antwort zurück.
__label__de	Lass es dir egal sein, was andere denken!
__label__de	Brian ist ganz schmutzig. Er hat Fußball gespielt.
__label__de	Als Tom aufwachte, sah er seinen Schlafanzug wie eine Wetterfahne am Baum vor seinem Schlafzimmerfenster wehen.
__label__de	Ich verspüre ein gewisses Hungergefühl.
__label__de	Ich habe einen kleinen Hunger.
__label__de	Tatsache ist, dass ich heute nicht zur Schule gegangen bin.
__label__de	Die Ergebnisse sind noch ungewiss
__label__de	Tom und Maria winkten sich über die Straße zu, als sie aneinander vorbeigingen.
__label__de	Halte dich vom Meer fern!
__label__de	Werden im Laden an der Ecke Monsterbälle verkauft?
__label__de	Er züchtet für den Markt Rinder.
__label__de	„Einen Fünfer pro Schmalzkringel? Das soll wohl ein Witz sein!“ – „Ich kann Sie also nicht in Versuchung führen?“ – „Ne, Kumpel, lass mal stecken!“
__label__de	Ich freue mich ja so, dass du es geschafft hast!
__label__de	Er trank nacheinander drei Tassen von dem Wasser.
__label__de	Alex schoss den Ball so hoch, dass er mit Schnee drauf wieder herunterkam.
__label__de	Jacques und Hélène sind begeistert von dem, was sie getan haben.
__label__de	Wenn wir den Namen der Stadt ausrufen, zu der Sie wollen, kommen Sie bitte nach vorne.
__label__de	Tom kam ins Zimmer stolziert und sah zufrieden aus.
__label__de	Streng dich an, dann schaffst du die Prüfung auch.
__label__de	Ich hatte gestern einen sehr produktiven Kochtag: ich habe Suppe, Kekse und zwei Kuchen gemacht.
__label__de	Tom schoss den Ball über die Latte.
__label__de	Ich bin mir nicht hundertprozentig sicher, ob es Wolle ist.
__label__de	Er sang falsch.
__label__de	Heiliger Himmel!
__label__de	Mach mal etwas Musik!
__label__de	Da drin war der Bär los.
__label__de	Der Klimawandel geht uns alle an.
__label__de	Teilen Sie nicht durch Null.
__label__de	Nicht durch Null dividieren.
__label__de	Verzeihen Sie mir, dass es mir schwer fällt, Ihnen zu glauben.
__label__de	Bäume sind lebende Organismen.
__label__de	Er geht immer in den Sielen.
__label__de	Was für eine Komödie!
__label__de	Was vier Beine hat, ist nicht unbedingt eine Katze.
__label__de	Ich hatte den Schlüssel mit.
__label__de	Ich war eine Verbrecherin.
__label__de	Ich war ein Verbrecher.
__label__de	Was ist die Währung von Griechenland?
__label__de	Welchen Wert hat dieses Haus?
__label__de	Das Ziel ist immer der maximale Gewinn.
__label__de	Du bist gut dabei, Tom!
__label__de	Sie müssen einen Schein an der Mautstelle lösen.
__label__de	„The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars“ („Der Aufstieg und Fall des Siggi Sternenstaub und der Spinnen vom Mars“), das 5. Album von David Bowie, erschien 1972.
__label__de	Sie ging zum Lebensmittelladen, um Kochbananen zu kaufen.
__label__de	Sie ist in ein anderes Land gegangen.
__label__de	Kaum dass sie dorthin gegangen war, wurde sie krank.
__label__de	Was gibt es im Laden?
__label__de	Tom hat seinen Realschulabschluss geschafft.
__label__de	Sie haben vermutlich eine Pollen- oder Stauballergie.
__label__de	Schon sein ganzes Leben erntet dieser Mann Kakaobohnen, aber Schokolade hat er noch nie gegessen.
__label__de	Politiker vertreten die Reichsten.
__label__de	Das Europäische Parlament hat den Superreichen gesetzlich erlaubt, Autos mit Verbrennungsmotor auch nach 2055 zu benutzen.
__label__de	Können Sie den Schmerz beschreiben?
__label__de	Kannst du den Schmerz beschreiben?
__label__de	Und was folgt daraus?
__label__de	Welches ist das größte Tier der Erde?
__label__de	Der Wal ist das größte Tier der Erde.
__label__de	Der Blauwal ist das größte Tier des Planeten.
__label__de	Nachts sank die Temperatur auf zehn Grad.
__label__de	Taifune sind sehr gefährlich.
__label__de	Was sind die Ursachen des Treibhauseffekts?
__label__de	Das knappe Wort ist besser als eine lange, fade Rede.
__label__de	Wenn es darauf ankommt, bist du der Einzige, auf den du zählen kannst.
__label__de	Danke, dass du mir geholfen hast, den Bericht ins Deutsche zu übersetzen!
__label__de	Danke schön fürs Zuhören gestern Abend.
__label__de	Vielen Dank fürs Einkaufen gehen für mich.
__label__de	Ich danke dir herzlich fürs Blumen gießen während meines Urlaubs.
__label__de	Ich bin dir sehr dankbar fürs Zeit nehmen und mir zu helfen.
__label__de	Danke schön fürs Abholen.
__label__de	Vielen Dank für deine Hilfe beim Abholen.
__label__de	Es war sehr aufmerksam von dir, mich abzuholen. Danke dafür.
__label__de	Darf ich dich duzen?
__label__de	Darf ich dich mit du ansprechen?
__label__de	Warum können wir nicht durch Null teilen?
__label__de	Gib mir mein Notizbuch.
__label__de	Möchtest du ein Stück Käse?
__label__de	Maria hat Zahnschmerzen.
__label__de	Die Summe von zwei und zehn ist zwölf.
__label__de	Die Quadratwurzel aus neun ist drei.
__label__de	Wie viele Ecken hat ein Würfel?
__label__de	Ich hätte schon längst schreiben sollen.
__label__de	Er ist das Zünglein an der Waage.
__label__de	Wer möchte noch ein Stück?
__label__de	Möchtest du ein Stück von der Torte?
__label__de	Ich weiß nicht, welche Laus ihm heute wieder über die Leber gelaufen ist.
__label__de	Als ich klein war, habe ich mich jeden Abend auf das Frühstück gefreut. Jetzt freue ich mich beim Frühstück auf das Abendessen.
__label__de	Sie arbeitet für eine ausländische Industrie.
__label__de	Er fehlte gestern krankheitsbedingt in der Schule.
__label__de	Der Weg biegt an der Brücke scharf ab.
__label__de	Tom drosch den Ball in Richtung des gegnerischen Tores.
__label__de	Es hat keinen Sinn, es jetzt zu bereuen.
__label__de	Du hast nichts davon, wenn du das machst.
__label__de	Stimmen Sie für Ihre Lieblingsörtlichkeit.
__label__de	Stimme für deine Lieblingsörtlichkeit.
__label__de	Stimmt für eure Lieblingsörtlichkeit.
__label__de	Die fiktive Stadt Middlemarch im gleichnamigen Roman von George Eliot basiert auf Coverntry.
__label__de	Der Mantel sitzt an den Schultern nicht richtig.
__label__de	Mr. Wall verschob den Zahnarztbesuch.
__label__de	Sie weiß nicht mehr, wie sie zum Campingplatz kommt.
__label__de	Rechts im Türdurchgang standen Marmeladengläser zum halben Preis.
__label__de	Ich habe den Eisbecher in den Einkaufswagen gestellt.
__label__de	Im Wald blüht ein Teppich aus Glockenblumen.
__label__de	Er lockte sie mit besserem Lohn.
__label__de	Die Stadt war nach dem Hochwasser menschenleer.
__label__de	Emilie hat zufällig ein altes Spielzeug gefunden.
__label__de	Ein Lastwagen hat sich auf der zweispurigen Fahrbahn quergestellt.
__label__de	Dass man seinen Arbeitsplatz gestrichen hatte, war für Tom ein unerwarteter Schock.
__label__de	Er behängte die Wand mit Postern.
__label__de	Warum trägst du das nie?
__label__de	Unter ebendiesen Umständen begann die Verfassungskrise.
__label__de	Bleib nicht zu lange auf!
__label__de	Hast du dich mal mit ihm hingesetzt und dich mit ihm unterhalten?
__label__de	Er hat durch Laufen 5 kg abgenommen.
__label__de	Er hat durch Laufen zehn Pfund abgenommen.
__label__de	Das Album ist fast spurlos in der Versenkung verschwunden; zu Lebzeiten des Musikers haben sich nur ein paar hundert Exemplare verkauft.
__label__de	Gelbe Doppellinien werden am Bürgersteig entlanggezogen und bedeuten, dass man dort nicht parken darf.
__label__de	Gelbe Doppellinien werden am Bürgersteig entlanggezogen und drücken ein Parkverbot aus.

__label__de	Ich habe mir das gestern auch so gedacht und bin nach etwa einem Monat mal wieder spazierengegangen, und draußen schien schön die Frühlingssonne. Heute und morgen werde ich frisch zur Arbeit gehen!
__label__de	Behalt’s zur Erinnerung an mich.
__label__de	Einwanderer in einem Einwanderer hassenden Einwanderungsland bin ich gern.
__label__de	Mein erstes Erdbeben habe ich in Tōkyō erlebt. Damals dachte ich, eine riesige Baumaschine fahre am Haus vorbei.
__label__de	Das ist für einen guten Zweck.

__label__de	Gekleidet in kostbarste Seide und Musselin, war sie die größte Schönheit im Schloss, aber sie konnte weder singen noch sprechen.
__label__de	Der Prinz in „Die kleine Meerjungfrau“ ist ein oberflächlicher Blödmann sondergleichen. Warum musste sie sich ausgerechnet in den verlieben?

__label__de	Hans ist handwerklich hoch begabt.
__label__de	Trautes Heim, Glück allein.
__label__de	Warum sagst du ihr nicht die Wahrheit?
__label__de	Warum erzählst du ihr nicht die Wahrheit?
__label__de	Warum sagen Sie ihr nicht die Wahrheit?
__label__de	Wer erinnert sich an unsere zehn Grundprinzipien?
__label__de	Liebe macht blind. Anders ist nicht zu erklären, warum Maria sich ausgerechnet in Tom verlieben musste.

__label__de	Danke fürs Kommen, um uns zu unterhalten.
__label__de	Bist du schon auf?
__label__de	Die kleine Meerjungfrau verliebte sich nicht in den Prinzen selbst, sondern in den Traum, den sein Anblick aus der Ferne in ihrem jungen und unerfahrenen und schutzlosen Herzen erweckt hatte. Ihre Heimat, ihre sie liebende und sich um sie sorgende Familie und sogar sich selbst gab sie auf, indem sie mit ihrer wunderschönen Stimme, diese zeichnete sie selbst unter ihresgleichen aus, die Verwandlung in einen Menschen bezahlte und ihre Identität als Prinzessin der Meere für diesen Mann verleugnete: statt des Fischschwanzes, der wohl für Menschen der damaligen Zeit etwas Hässliches war und sie von diesen unterschied, bekam sie Beine. Das, glaubte sie, würde ihr seine Liebe garantieren, aber nun hatte sich der Prinz in ebendiese ihre Stimme verliebt – mit dieser hatte sie ihn berührt, als sie ihn vor dem Ertrinken rettete –, und ihr liebes Wesen und ihre unvergleichliche Schönheit berührten ihn nicht. Was lernen wir aus dieser Geschichte?

__label__de	Layla überlebte die eiskalte Nacht.
__label__de	Wir beide haben eine Menge zusammen durchgestanden.
__label__de	Du sollst doch für die Klausur morgen lernen.
__label__de	Du bist bestimmt froh, in der Klassenarbeit so eine gute Note bekommen zu haben.
__label__de	Du hast eine Frage gestellt, und jetzt beantwortest du sie selbst.
__label__de	Maria ist keine Überfrau.
__label__de	Ich stelle das, was du gesagt hast, gar nicht in Abrede.
__label__de	Mir gefällt die Farbe, mit der du deine Wände gestrichen hast.
__label__de	Willst du mir nicht die Chance geben, auf das, was du gerade gesagt hast, zu antworten?
__label__de	Du hast eine Frage gestellt, aber jetzt beantwortest du sie selbst.

__label__de	Tom machte einen sehr selbstbewussten Eindruck.
__label__de	Das kannst du wirklich überhaupt nicht.
__label__de	Ich habe einen Bogen, aber keine Pfeile.
__label__de	Wo habe ich meinen Zauberstab hingelegt?
__label__de	Sie sind selten zu Hause.
__label__de	Das Abendessen ist schon fertig.
__label__de	Das Abendessen ist schon fast fertig.

__label__de	Am 18. Oktober 1963 schickten französische Wissenschaftler die erste Katze an Bord der Höhenforschungsrakete Véronique AGI 47 in den Weltraum. Die Katze, die Félicette hieß, wurde nach einer Fallschirmlandung wohlbehalten zurückgeholt.
__label__de	Die Entwicklung sicherer und wirksamer Impfstoffe braucht Zeit, Geld und ausgiebige Forschung.
__label__de	Bist du ehrlich oder lügst du mich an?
__label__de	Die Musik war in jeglicher Hinsicht ein wesentliches Element der Gesellschaft der alten Griechenland, sei es bei religiösen, gesellschaftlichen oder sportlichen Veranstaltungen.
__label__de	Tom schlug vor, dass wir heiraten, damit ich eine dauerhafte Aufenthaltserlaubnis beantragen könne.
__label__de	Viel Glück bei deiner Verabredung!
__label__de	Mir gefällt das Parfum, das du trägst.
__label__de	„Mir gefällt das Parfum, das du trägst“, bemerkte Tom freundlich, denn er wollte Maria ein Kompliment machen. Diese hob die Nase ein wenig an und erwiderte mit einem süffisanten Lächeln: „Das freut mich. Du könntest es dir nicht leisten, mir ein Fläschchen davon zu schenken.“ Tom wandte sich ab.
__label__de	Anna hat ihre Ausbildung hingeschmissen, um von dem zu leben, was ihr reiche, meist ältere Herren, ihre sogenannten „Sugar daddies“, dafür geben, dass sie sich mal ein Wochenende oder ein paarmal im Monat – für die ist das dann ein Seitensprung, eine heimliche Affäre – mit ihnen trifft. Mittlerweile hat sie mehrere davon und verdient so deutlich mehr als manch anderer mit einem anständigen Beruf. Hinzu kommt, dass sie von diesen Typen ausstaffiert wird, in dicken Autos abgeholt wird und Kostproben eines Lebens in Saus und Braus genießen kann.
__label__de	„Es ist ja schön, wenn Anna reiche, ältere Herren als Gönner hat, aber sie sollte trotzdem ihre Ausbildung machen; sonst ist sie diesen Typen irgendwann zu alt – die suchen sich Jüngere –, und dann steht sie ohne Ausbildung, nur mit Hauptschulabschluss, da.“ – „Vielleicht heiratet sie ja bis dahin einer.“ – „So ein Leben in totaler Abhängigkeit wäre nichts für mich.“ – „Für Anna vielleicht schon. Das muss halt jeder selber wissen.“
__label__de	„Du meinst, dieser alte Mann, mit dem wir sie neulich Hand in Hand in der Stadt gesehen haben, das war gar nicht ihr Opa, sondern ihr ...?“ – „So sieht es aus!“ – „Das glaube ich jetzt nicht! Du willst mich verarschen!“
__label__de	Ich will selbständig und nicht von irgendeinem Typen abhängig sein. Ich will jederzeit „Tschüssikowski!“ sagen und verschwinden können.
__label__de	Jederzeit „Tschüssikowski!“ sagen zu können ist für Petra die wichtigste Voraussetzung für jede Beziehung.
__label__de	Ich habe „Tschüssikowski!“ gesagt, und dann war ich weg. So lasse ich mich nicht behandeln.
__label__de	Heute, der 8. März, ist der Tag des Jahres, an dem Frauen im Rampenlicht stehen.
__label__de	Er hat wohl eine Abneigung gegen Weihnachten.
__label__de	Tom und Maria tauschten Liebesbriefe aus.
__label__de	Die Worte sind mir rausgerutscht.
__label__de	Die sieben Zwerge waren gutherzig.
__label__de	Tom ist in sich gekehrt und schüchtern.
__label__de	Der Herzog trug einen weißen Umhang.
__label__de	Verliebte sind bisweilen unvernünftig.
__label__de	Man verhält sich, wenn man verliebt ist, manchmal unvernünftig.
__label__de	Er weiß über alles Bescheid.
__label__de	Gleich wirst du es sehen.
__label__de	Morgen beginnt das Fest.
__label__de	Durch die Wortstellung des Satzes konnte Tom Maria ganz nah sein.
__label__de	Ich habe es erst vor einer Stunde erfahren.
__label__de	Diese Käse ist wie Gummi.
__label__de	Wir bringen ihm das Lesen und Schreiben bei.
__label__de	Auf Zimmer 301 wohnt eine Hexe.
__label__de	Aus welchem Material ist das?
__label__de	Ein Mann folgte mir.
__label__de	Sag nur, dass du kommst, wenn du wirklich kommst!
__label__de	Wir fangen morgen um sieben an.

__label__de	Tom trinkt Kamillentee.
__label__de	Nehmen wir an, dieser Kohl ist die Sonne.
__label__de	Europa reicht vom Ural bis zum Atlantik, vom Mittelmeer bis zum Nordkap.
__label__de	Die Frau ist die Zukunft des Mannes.
__label__de	Was meinst du, wie viele Sprachen es gibt?
__label__de	Was Tom sagte, war unwahrscheinlich, aber ich tat so, als glaubte ich ihm.
__label__de	Da mache ich mir keinen Kopf drum.
__label__de	Da würde ich mir keinen Kopf machen.
__label__de	Wir hätten mit dem Zug dorthin fahren sollen.
__label__de	Mein Zimmer ist klein, aber für mich ist es groß genug.

__label__de	Aschenputtel verließ den Ball beim letzten Mitternachtsschlag.
__label__de	Manchmal glaube ich, sie will die Wahrheit gar nicht wissen.
__label__de	Tom hat einen Pagenschnitt.
__label__de	Die Kette ist nicht stärker als ihr schwächstes Glied.
__label__de	Sie will ein großes Haus und ein dickes Auto.
__label__de	Schnell! Versteck dich hier drin!
__label__de	Als er aufwachte, war die Feier schon fast vorbei.
__label__de	Grüßen Sie Ihre Mutter von mir!
__label__de	Diese „Freunde“ üben einen schlechten Einfluss auf euch aus.
__label__de	Ich habe enorme Probleme.
__label__de	Mein Außenspiegel muss richtig eingestellt werden.
__label__de	Wie viele lebende Symphoniker gibt es?
__label__de	Es gibt keinen überzeugenden Beweis, der diese Behauptungen stützt.
__label__de	Es dauerte eine Weile, bis ich kapiert hatte, wovon er da sprach.
__label__de	Wegen des schlechten Wetters wurde jeglicher Gedanke, die Stadt zu besichtigen, fallengelassen.
__label__de	Wegen des schlechten Wetters habe ich den Gedanken, die Stadt zu besichtigen, fallenlassen.
__label__de	Mein Außenspiegel muss neu eingestellt werden.
__label__de	Pass auf, dass du nicht über die Farbdose da stolperst!
__label__de	Seine Frau ist eine bekannte Bildhauerin.
__label__de	„Ich habe eine Farbdose umgeworfen.“ – „Du Trampel!“
__label__de	Danke, dass du mich darauf aufmerksam gemacht hast!
__label__de	Danke, dass Sie mich darauf aufmerksam gemacht haben!
__label__de	Danke, dass ihr mich darauf aufmerksam gemacht habt!
__label__de	Ich brauche noch eine Dose Farbe.
__label__de	Die Oberfläche hat so viele kleine Kratzer und Dellen, dass es keinen Sinn hat, die polieren zu wollen.
__label__de	Sie stand da und suchte Kleingeld zusammen.
__label__de	„Hast du da mit meiner Freundin angebändelt?“ – „Das war nur ein kleiner Schmatzer auf dem Sofa. Es war Weihnachten. Wir hatten einen im Kahn. Das bedeutete überhaupt nichts.“
__label__de	Sie wurde dabei gesehen, wie sie über die Straße lief und einen Laternenmast hinaufkletterte.
__label__de	Die in Caistor St Edmunds, einige Meilen südlich des heutigen Norwich, anässigen Icener waren ein keltischer Stamm, dessen Kriegerkönigin Boudicca einen missglückten Aufstand gegen die römischen Besatzer anführte, bei dem die Städte Londinium (London), Camulodunum (Colchester) und Verulamium (St Albans) geplündert und gebrandschatzt wurden.
__label__de	Er hatte eine freundliche Art.
__label__de	Meinst du?
__label__de	Ich bin entschlossen, diesen Plan auszuführen.
__label__de	In der modernen Kriegsführung müssen die Soldaten nicht unbedingt bis an die Zähne bewaffnet sein, um als Kämpfer wirksam zu agieren.

__label__de	In Budapest gibt es Smogalarm.
__label__de	Ist dir das nicht genug?
__label__de	War dir das nicht genug?
__label__de	Warum bist du so unersättlich?
__label__de	Ein ehrlicherer Mensch hat nie gelebt.
__label__de	Ein ehrlicherer Mann hat nie gelebt.
__label__de	Und das genügt dir nicht?

__label__de	Tom war wahrscheinlich die kleinste Person im Raum.
__label__de	Warum setzen wir uns nicht zum Kamin?
__label__de	Mary ist ihr ganzes Leben eine Glücksspielerin gewesen.
__label__de	Tom sagt, er hofft, dass du das tun wirst.

__label__de	Einige italienische Modedesigner behaupten, dass weiße Badeanzüge dieses Jahr im Trend sein werden.
__label__de	Aber du wirst mir was schuldig sein.
__label__de	Geh und schau, ob du Tom finden kannst.
__label__de	Mein Geliebter arbeitet an einer Sprachschule und liebt es sehr.
__label__de	Ziri hörte eine Art dämonisches Heulen.
__label__de	Tom traf jemanden namens Mary im Park.
__label__de	Ich schätze, ich hätte Tom helfen müssen.
__label__de	Sie können einfach nichts richtig machen, oder?
__label__de	Ich glaube, du bist derjenige, der es kaputtgemacht hat.

__label__de	Ich wusste, dass Tom meine Einladung annehmen würde.
__label__de	Trägst du diese Schuhe oft?
__label__de	Tom erzählte mir, dass er Mary treffen wollte.

__label__de	Sie ist das hübscheste Mädchen in der Klasse.
__label__de	In unserer Straße ist es lauter als in eurer.
__label__de	Hast du dir weh getan, mein Schatz? Ach, du armer Wicht. Lass die Mama mal sehen!
__label__de	Ich will diesen missratenen kleinen Jungen nie wiedersehen.
__label__de	Hast du schon den süßen kleinen Jungen getroffen, der nebenan eingezogen ist?
__label__de	Wir suchen eine kleine, nicht zu weit von der Innenstadt entfernte Wohnung.
__label__de	In diesem Zimmer bin ich am liebsten, weil es schön und sonnig ist.
__label__de	Wenn du den Tisch deckst, mache ich das Abendessen.
__label__de	Zum Abendessen hätte ich Lust auf Indisch.
__label__de	Ist das Buch, das sie liest, interessant?
__label__de	Wir sind letztes Jahr zweimal dort gewesen.
__label__de	Wir sind letzte Woche dreimal essen gewesen.
__label__de	Kommt heute Abend etwas Interessantes im Fernsehen?
__label__de	Die Ära der Fernseh-Abendunterhaltung ist vorbei. Das merkt man auch daran, dass nur noch Müll produziert wird und sich keiner mehr Mühe gibt.
__label__de	Sie ziehen nächstes Jahr in die Staaten.
__label__de	Das Klassentreffen ist übernächsten Dienstag.
__label__de	Wir treffen uns alle am Dienstag abend im Pub.
__label__de	Ich habe ihn im Frühling 2020 kennengelernt.
__label__de	Emilie geht jeden Tag zu Fuß zur Schule.
__label__de	Emilie besucht die örtliche Schule.
__label__de	Emilies Familie geht jeden Sonntag in die Kirche.
__label__de	Emilies Familie geht in die Kirche am Ende der Straße.
__label__de	Maria könnte nächsten Monat im Urlaub sein.
__label__de	Der Zucker steht da drüben neben dem Mehl.
__label__de	Wenn die Musik aufhört zu spielen, schnappt euch einen Stuhl.
__label__de	Der Erfolg der Mannschaft ist vor allem dem neuen Trainer zu verdanken.
__label__de	Sie hat uns zu ihrer Feier eingeladen, was nett von ihr war.
__label__de	Viel Geld gäbe ich dafür nicht aus.
__label__de	Sie ist wahrscheinlich zu Hause.
__label__de	Um wieviel Uhr fährst du zur Arbeit?
__label__de	Um wieviel Uhr fahren Sie zur Arbeit?
__label__de	Um wieviel Uhr fahrt ihr zur Arbeit?
__label__de	Die Arbeit, der ich nachgehe, ist sehr interessant.
__label__de	Emilies Mutter ist zwecks eines Treffens mit den Lehrern zur Schule gefahren.
__label__de	Tom kann sich nicht entsinnen, Maria darum gebeten zu haben.
__label__de	Ich will kein Mitleid und noch viel weniger gute Ratschläge.
__label__de	Das hat mir den Appetit verdorben.
__label__de	Tom hat ein Kunstbein.
__label__de	Der streng nach Urin stinkende Obdachlose, von dem die anderen Kunden schon einigen Abstand hielten, reichte der Kassiererin mit seiner schmutzigen Hand einige Münzen, um davon seine Flasche Schnaps zu bezahlen. Sie gab ihm höflich sein Wechselgeld und lächelte ihn an. Erst als er sich entfernt hatte, griff sie, jetzt ganz schnell, nach der Sprühflasche mit dem Desinfektionsmittel, und es wurde allzu deutlich, wie sehr es sie geschauert hatte.
__label__de	Ein ehrwürdig aussehender alter Mann mit einem langen, grauen, sehr gepflegt wirkenden Bart, der meine Bewunderung auf sich zog, kam in die Imbißstube. Ich fragte mich, was er wohl bestellen würde. Als er dann aber plötzlich anfing, sich von den Resten zu bedienen, die Gäste auf ihren Tabletts in einen Ständer geschoben hatten, erkannte ich, dass das ein hungriger Obdachloser war, dem ich es nicht angesehen hatte.
__label__de	Was es in anderen Ländern selbstverständlich umsonst gibt, dafür muss man in Deutschland zahlen.
__label__de	Diesen Politikern das Liebste ist es, für alles und irgendwas zu zahlen.
__label__de	Michel wünscht sich Bewunderung, erntet aber eigentlich nur Spott und Hohn.
__label__de	Man hört eigentlich immer nur „Zahlen, zahlen, zahlen!“ Können wir nicht auch mal was verdienen?
__label__de	Was in diesem Land abgeht, das ist wirklich zum Verzweifeln, und man ist so machtlos dagegen.
__label__de	Tom liest praktisch überhaupt keine Bücher.
__label__de	Wer kennt das nicht: man hat sich gerade lange Nägel machen lassen, und jetzt gilt es, die Karte aus dem Bankautomaten zu ziehen. Ich habe dafür immer eine Pinzette dabei. Damit geht das prima.
__label__de	Früher habe ich mich darüber aufgeregt; inzwischen ist es mir egal.
__label__de	Was nützt es, sich über Dinge aufzuregen, die man eh nicht ändern kann?
__label__de	Ich schone meine Nerven und lese keine Nachrichten mehr.
__label__de	Die Berichterstattung ist überwiegend negativ.
__label__de	Tom hat ein künstliches Bein.
__label__de	Ich bin gerade aus dem Vereinigten Königreich zurückgekommen.
__label__de	Das muss eine optische Illusion sein.
__label__de	Ich freue mich sehr auf diesen Film.
__label__de	Er war zum Flughafen gekommen, um Mr. West abzuholen.
__label__de	Es hat gestern geregnet.
__label__de	Es war gestern regnerisch.
__label__de	Mach mal das Fenster auf! Hier drinnen geht man ja vor Hitze ein.
__label__de	Ich stehe unter einem Baum.
__label__de	Sie fasste sich ans Haar. Es war nass.
__label__de	Sie will unbedingt ins Ausland.
__label__de	Tom wurde vergesslich.
__label__de	Ziemlich viele Menschen glauben das noch immer.
__label__de	Der ganze Platz war voller Füchse, die wild durcheinander- und übereinander hinwegsprangen.
__label__de	Es soll hier viele Füchse geben, aber man bekommt sie selten zu Gesicht.
__label__de	Sami ist Moslem, aber seine Kinder sind Christen.
__label__de	„Ich glaube, es wird bald regnen.“ – „Das glaube ich auch.“
__label__de	Mein jüngster Bruder ist größer als ich.
__label__de	Die Vögel fliegen im Winter nach Süden.
__label__de	Es war nur eine optische Täuschung.
__label__de	Gestern traf ich einen der größten Schauspieler unserer Generation.
__label__de	Das muss eine optische Täuschung sein.
__label__de	Es war nur ein Gerücht.
__label__de	Wie wird dieses Gerät verwendet?
__label__de	Welche Farbe hat Schnee?
__label__de	Krümel muss operiert werden.
__label__de	Ich stehe auf einer Brücke.
__label__de	Ich stehe auf einem Tisch.
__label__de	Ich stehe unter einer Brücke.
__label__de	Wir verkaufen nur Produkte bester Qualität.
__label__de	Kehren Sie bitte zu Ihren Plätzen zurück.
__label__de	Dem wollte ich was verklickern, aber ich habe dann doch nichts gesagt.
__label__de	Ob es regnet oder ob die Sonne scheint: morgen fahre ich los.
__label__de	Dieser Wald muss geschützt werden.
__label__de	Mir tut der Kopf weh. Hast du Kopfschmerztabletten?
__label__de	Mir tut der Kopf weh. Haben Sie Kopfschmerztabletten?
__label__de	Ich glaub’, mich tritt ein Pferd!
__label__de	Ich glaub’, mich knutscht ein Elch!
__label__de	Ich habe vergessen, die Fenster zu schließen.
__label__de	Könntest du mich zum Kino bringen?
__label__de	Meine Kinder lieben Lakritz.
__label__de	Alle drei hassten sich.
__label__de	Sie kam sehr spät an.
__label__de	Die meisten Geschäfte haben um zehn Uhr geschlossen.
__label__de	Ich warte auf meine Mama.
__label__de	Sie hat eine Gehaltserhöhung verdient.
__label__de	Ich habe den Morgen über Briefe geschrieben.
__label__de	Aber er hat ja gar nichts an!
__label__de	Der Kaiser hat keine Kleider an.
__label__de	Ich sitze unter einem Baum.
__label__de	Maria erblindete.
__label__de	Die polnische Sprache ist interessant.
__label__de	Es kommt bald an.
__label__de	Er hat seinen Traum erfolgreich in die Tat umgesetzt.
__label__de	Ruf mich bitte heute Abend an.
__label__de	Er soll morgen anfangen.
__label__de	Wann wurde das Baby geboren?
__label__de	Ich habe meinen Schirm im Zug liegenlassen.
__label__de	Die Krankenschwester bandagierte mir behutsam den Kopf.
__label__de	Im Sommer sind viele Sterne am Nachthimmel zu sehen.
__label__de	Kann man Frieden nur durch Krieg erreichen?
__label__de	Wird Frieden nur durch Krieg gewonnen?
__label__de	Warum muss es immer den „deutschen Sonderweg“ geben?
__label__de	Er kümmert sich um den letzten Entwurf.
__label__de	Ich habe den ganzen Tag an dich gedacht, Miyu.
__label__de	Er hat darum gebeten, nicht gestört zu werden.
__label__de	Ein Mr. Smith war da und wollte dich sprechen.
__label__de	Tom ist zerstreut geworden.
__label__de	Im vierten Stock ist auch eine Toilette.
__label__de	Im dritten Stock ist auch eine Toilette.
__label__de	Ich habe mein Portemonnaie zu Hause gelassen.
__label__de	Könntest du mich zum Bahnhof bringen?
__label__de	Könntet ihr mich zum Bahnhof bringen?
__label__de	Da ich nichts von ihm gehört hatte, schrieb ich ihm erneut.
__label__de	Kein einziger Mensch war auf der Straße.
__label__de	Red nicht lange um den heißen Brei herum, sondern sag mir, was los ist!
__label__de	Es ist am Sonntag angekommen.
__label__de	Sie haben das dritte Jahr in Folge gewonnen.
__label__de	Weil er krank war, konnte er nicht auf die Feier.
__label__de	Wegen des regnerischen Wetters wurde das Baseballspiel abgesagt.
__label__de	Er sagte, er würde in zehn Minuten anrufen. Das war vor einer halben Stunde.
__label__de	Er sagte, er würde in zehn Minuten anrufen, aber das war vor einer halben Stunde.
__label__de	Er schlug Nägel in das Brett.
__label__de	Tom ist für diese Arbeit nicht qualifiziert.
__label__de	Danke für diese tröstenden Worte!
__label__de	Hans wird groß und stark; Christina wird immer schöner.
__label__de	Es sieht so aus, als würde es heute wieder ein schöner Tag.
__label__de	Ihr Haar wurde grau.
__label__de	Bleib doch noch zum Mittagessen!
__label__de	Denkst du, sie werden wissen, dass wir von Boston sind?
__label__de	Es wäre besser, du sagtest nicht.
__label__de	Sami tat alles, was in seiner Macht stand, um Laylas Sorgerecht zu erhalten.
__label__de	Sami war derjenige, der von Laylas Tod profitierte.
__label__de	Naomi freut sich sehr, den ersten Preis gewonnen zu haben.
__label__de	Sie haben ihren Plan geändert.
__label__de	Tom ist der einzige, der schläft.
__label__de	Es sieht so aus, als würde es heute wieder schön.
__label__de	Du weisst, dass du das nicht tun musst, oder?
__label__de	Er möchte, dass du da bist, um ihn zu empfangen.
__label__de	Baum fällt!
__label__de	Welche Verhaltensmuster würdest du als typisch männlich ansehen?
__label__de	Was ist aus dir geworden?
__label__de	Mit mir ist alles in Ordnung
__label__de	Ich denke, ich könnte überzeugt werden.
__label__de	Tom, Mary, John und Alice gingen alle in die Höhle.
__label__de	Warst du zu seiner Geburtstagsfeier eingeladen?
__label__de	Denk dran, morgen die Briefe einzuwerfen!
__label__de	Tom hat einen Ort gefunden, wo er gratis Golf spielen kann.
__label__de	Ich sollte ihr sagen, sie soll es probieren.
__label__de	Tom ist so um fünf Uhr herum hier.
__label__de	ich hoffe einfach, das passiert nie wieder.
__label__de	Sie hat eine Liebe zur Musik.
__label__de	Ich wünsche dir jedes Glück der Welt!
__label__de	Ich lebe hier schon seit knapp über 60 Jahren.
__label__de	Musst du nicht noch mal aufs Klo, bevor wir fahren?
__label__de	So ist’s recht!
__label__de	Ist es teurer, gesund zu essen?
__label__de	Und du hast dich auch bewaffnet, ehe du dich aufgemacht?
__label__de	Hier ist die Polizei. Machen Sie mal bitte die Tür auf?
__label__de	Sein Geld wird Emil wohl nicht wiedersehen.
__label__de	Zwei Wagen sind bei einem Überholmanöver ineinandergekracht. Ein Fahrer wurde dabei schwer verletzt.
__label__de	Der Verkehr soll einspurig an der Unfallstelle vorbeigeleitet werden. Wenn die Fahrzeuge wieder ins Rollen kommen, ist das immer einer der gefährlichsten Momente für die Beamten auf der Fahrbahn.
__label__de	Der Stau löste sich langsam auf.
__label__de	Japan hat einen Überschuss an Reis, Europa an Wein.
__label__de	Viele Bäume wurden vom Wind entwurzelt.
__label__de	Haben Sie Gepäck?
__label__de	Hast du Gepäck?
__label__de	Habt ihr Gepäck?
__label__de	Hast du schon den Bericht?
__label__de	Im Sommer haben sie früher den ganzen Tag am Strand gespielt.
__label__de	Ich dusche heute Abend.
__label__de	Sie fährt nie mit dem Auro.
__label__de	Multiplizieren Sie es mit einer zufälligen negativen Zahl.
__label__de	Der Krieg wird es immer geben, bis der Mensch sich endlich selbst kennt.
__label__de	Sie beobachten euch.
__label__de	Sie beobachten Sie.
__label__de	Sie beobachten mich alle.
__label__de	Jemand beobachtet uns.
__label__de	Die Milch ist frisch.
__label__de	Was ist der Unterschied zwischen diesen Konzepten?
__label__de	Es gibt Angenehmeres, als hier im Regen zu stehen.
__label__de	Dieser Sommer ist der heißeste seit dreißig Jahren.
__label__de	Hat sie sich bei dir gemeldet?
__label__de	Es soll kälter werden.
__label__de	Der Busfahrer sah uns böse an, weil wir schrien.
__label__de	Wir können nur raten, was dort geschehen ist.
__label__de	Soll ich den Kaffee aufwärmen, oder was?
__label__de	Sprich dieses Thema in ihrer Gegenwart nicht an.
__label__de	Ab 18 Uhr verschwanden die Angestellten langsam.
__label__de	Er wollte anonym bleiben.
__label__de	Ich brauche die heute.
__label__de	Infolge der Überarbeitung wurde er krank.
__label__de	Er arbeitete zuviel und wurde krank.
__label__de	Muss ich zur Arbeit eine Krawatte umbinden?
__label__de	Ich bin im Haus und warte.
__label__de	Die Straßenbahn wird dich ins Herz der Stadt bringen.
__label__de	Unser Plan ist in der Praxis nicht aufgegangen.
__label__de	Sie wollte unerkannt bleiben.
__label__de	Ich war auf der Suche nach einer Unterkunft.
__label__de	Der Minister musste sich einer Flut von Pressefragen stellen.
__label__de	Die Ministerin musste sich einer Flut von Pressefragen stellen.
__label__de	„Seine Exzellenz der Herr Minister“ hieß es früher ehrfurchtsvoll, und alle verneigten sich. Das ist heute anders.
__label__de	Sie haben das Zimmer oben an einen Studenten vermietet.
__label__de	Sie haben das Zimmer oben an eine Studentin vermietet.
__label__de	Sie wollte eine bessere Arbeit, als Bürofußböden zu reinigen.
__label__de	Am Rande der Lichtung liegen die Stämme mehrerer vom Sturm umgewehter Bäume.
__label__de	Er war nicht einmal einen Monat im Ausland, da wurde er krank.
__label__de	Der Feldzug gegen die Drogen ist vorbei. Die Drogen haben gewonnen.
__label__de	Dieser arme Mann weiß nicht, was er tun soll.
__label__de	Dieses Gewehr stammte noch von seinem Großvater und war gerade gut genug, um einem schlummernden Hasen zwischen die Ohren zu schießen.
__label__de	Grüßen Sie Ihre Frau von mir.
__label__de	Ich bin ein gewöhnlicher Sterblicher.
__label__de	Grüßen Sie bitte Ihre Mutter von mir.
__label__de	Maria ist schwanger, und Elke ist es auch.
__label__de	Die Leute haben Angst, von der Regierungsmeinung abweichende Ansichten zu äußern.
__label__de	Ich verspreche, dass wir auf alles, was du sagst, hören werden.
__label__de	Sie lächelte mich an, als sie auf der Straße an mir vorbeiging.
__label__de	Das Herbstwetter ist veränderlich.
__label__de	Was ist denn das für ein Geräusch?
__label__de	Wir sehen uns den Film an.
__label__de	Er ist stinksauer.
__label__de	Sind alle gleich?
__label__de	Sie scheint sich für Fußball überhaupt nicht zu interessieren.
__label__de	Ich will mich mit ihm nicht streiten.
__label__de	Dieser Zug endet hier.
__label__de	Das ist mir durchaus recht.
__label__de	Die öffentliche Meinung ist gegen den Kurs.
__label__de	Bring dieses Thema nicht in seiner Gegenwart zur Sprache.
__label__de	Er trat aus gesundheitlichen Gründen zurück.
__label__de	Es kostet nur sechs Pence pro Sekunde.
__label__de	Ihr Haar ist grau geworden.
__label__de	Sie Ski müssen genau parallel gehalten werden.
__label__de	Der Rektor gab jedem Absolventen die Hand.
__label__de	Die Wohnungsknappheit ist sehr ernst.
__label__de	Ich wäre gern dabei, aber leider kann ich nicht.
__label__de	Dass ausgerechnet du das sagen musst!
__label__de	Seine Haare wurden grau.
__label__de	Es gab Lavendel, so weit das Auge reichte.
__label__de	Wärest du gern ein Popstar?
__label__de	Wir saßen gemütlich da.
__label__de	Obwohl er nebenan wohnt, grüßt er uns nicht einmal.
__label__de	Keiner von uns traut sich, mit dem Fahrstuhl ins oberste Stockwerk zu fahren.
__label__de	Keiner von uns traut sich, mit dem Fahrstuhl bis ganz nach oben zu fahren.
__label__de	Auf der Realschule bin ich jeden Morgen um 6 Uhr aufgestanden.
__label__de	Maria ist immer für einen Spaß zu haben.
__label__de	Die Neuigkeit höre ich mit Bedauern.
__label__de	Seine Stelle wird gestrichen.
__label__de	Es ist ewig her, seit wir uns gesehen haben!
__label__de	Läufst du lieber, oder fährst du lieber mit dem Rad?
__label__de	Du siehst umwerfend aus!
__label__de	Er unterbrach sein Studium.
__label__de	Tom darf mit, wenn er will.
__label__de	Diese Plätze sind reserviert.
__label__de	Diese Plätze sind besetzt.
__label__de	Willst außerdem noch etwas anderes?
__label__de	Für einen strengen Winter sind wir überhaupt nicht gerüstet.
__label__de	Ihre Kimono-Obi-Kombination ist aber elegant!
__label__de	Sie sind quer durch Europa geradelt.
__label__de	Der Bahnhof befindet sich in der Nähe des Hotels.
__label__de	Kannst du dem, was ich sage, folgen?
__label__de	Ich bin ein Kinofreund.
__label__de	Ich stimme dir zu. Ganz genauso sehe ich das auch.
__label__de	Ich esse Krabben am liebsten gebraten.
__label__de	Tom wurde zerstreut.
__label__de	Wir konnten während des Gespräches einiges klären.
__label__de	Das Tageslicht schwindet draußen langsam.
__label__de	Man hofft, die Lebensmittelproduktion durch den Anbau neuer Reissorten steigern zu können.
__label__de	Was er sagt, stimmt in gewissem Maße.
__label__de	Selig sind, die da ein schlechtes Gedächtnis haben.
__label__de	Frau Suzuki hielt an jenem Nachmittage eine Rede.
__label__de	Du hast ihnen gesagt, dass sie das nicht sollen.
__label__de	Sie räumte ihr Zimmer auf, bevor ihre Gäste kamen.
__label__de	Sie ist heute Abend hier.
__label__de	Wer war denn das, mit dem du da gestern Abernd zusammen warst?
__label__de	Wir haben nur zu MIttag gegessen.
__label__de	Es ist gut, wenn man sich ganz auf seine Arbeit konzentrieren kann, aber du ignorierst ja völlig die Leute um dich herum.
__label__de	Ich hätte für folgendes gern ein Angebot.
__label__de	Ihr Blick ruhte auf dem jungen Mann, der Zeitung las.
__label__de	Jeder hat ausreichend viel Nahrung und Kleidung bekommen.
__label__de	Ich kann gar nicht in Worte fassen, wie glücklich ich über die Nachricht bin.
__label__de	Er will kein Brot kaufen.
__label__de	Erwähne in ihrer Gegenwart dieses Thema nicht.
__label__de	Er grämt sich wegen seiner vergangenen Misserfolge.
__label__de	Sein Zustand hat sich stetig gebessert.
__label__de	Im Frühling machen wir das Haus gerne gründlich sauber.
__label__de	Hör zu, du!
__label__de	Damit kommen wir zum Thema.
__label__de	Es war Mr. White, der Joe diese Fahrkarte gegeben hat.
__label__de	Es war Mr. White, der Joe diese Eintrittskarte gegeben hat.
__label__de	Wir haben nur zu Abend gegessen.
__label__de	Denkst du, dass der Film bald zu Ende ist?
__label__de	Du wirst alles tun, was du kannst.
__label__de	Dann stellte ich fest, dass ich meine Geldbörse zu Hause gelassen hatte.
__label__de	Man kann von draußen die Schokolade riechen!
__label__de	Dieses Bett scheint stabil zu sein.
__label__de	Häng die Sachen in den Kleiderschrank.
__label__de	Dank ihm sind wir hier.
__label__de	Soweit ich ihn kannte, war Herr Schmidt ein bescheidener Mann.
__label__de	Er hat nie mit seinem Wissen geprahlt.
__label__de	Die Fahrkarte, die du gekauft hast, gilt nicht zu den Stoßzeiten.
__label__de	Er setzt sich für die Demokratie ein.
__label__de	Die passen gut zueinander.
__label__de	Die Sommerfeldfrüchte ernten wir im Herbst.
__label__de	Läuft die Maschine?
__label__de	Stell die Uhr mal richtig ein.
__label__de	Es waren nicht weniger als tausend Leute dort.
__label__de	Erwähne dieses Thema in seiner Gegenwart nicht!
__label__de	Er tauchte ins Wasser und kam zum Luftholen wieder hoch.
__label__de	Du bist gutaussehend!
__label__de	Ich weiß nicht, wann ich wieder zu Hause bin.
__label__de	Warum gibt es etwas und nicht nichts?
__label__de	Ich bin Jack.
__label__de	„Versprichst du es?“ – „Ja.“
__label__de	Unser Wagen bekam unterwegs einen Motorschaden.
__label__de	Du solltest dir vor der Klausur noch mal Geschichte ansehen.
__label__de	Auf Etikette legt unsere Lehrerin viel Wert, oder?
__label__de	Das Regenwasser fließt durch dieses Rohr ab.
__label__de	Die Dämme wurden verstärkt, um das Dorf vor Hochwasser zu schützen.
__label__de	„Was lernst du in der Schule?“ – „Italienisch.“
__label__de	Hier scheint sich’s gut zu wohnen.
__label__de	Ich schreibe es an die Tafel.
__label__de	Tom und Mary begriffen, dass sie zu viel gesagt hatten.
__label__de	Das Baby hat gerade getreten.
__label__de	Wir standen stundenlang an.
__label__de	Wir stehen schon seit Stunden an.
__label__de	Ich war mein ganzes Leben noch nie so hungrig gewesen.
__label__de	Den Typen kenne ich.
__label__de	Ich war müde, aber zum Schlafen war mir nicht zumute.
__label__de	Es gibt keine Gerechtigkeit.
__label__de	Das ist doch himmlisch!
__label__de	Was für ein schöner Ausblick!
__label__de	Ungarisch ist eine ausgesprochen schöne Sprache.
__label__de	Traurigkeit und Glück sind gegensätzliche Gefühle.
__label__de	Slowenisch ist eine schöne Sprache.
__label__de	Sie wird für immer in meinem Herzen sein.
__label__de	Der Apfelkuchen kam frisch aus dem Ofen.
__label__de	Niederländisch ist die offizielle Sprache der Niederlande.
__label__de	Können wir vergessen, dass das gerade passiert ist?
__label__de	Die Programmierer konnten die Ursache des Fehlers nicht finden.
__label__de	„Was sind das da drüben alles für Leute?“ – „Das ist ein Spiegel, Tom.“
__label__de	„Was sind das da für Leute?“ – „Das ist ein Spiegel, Tom.“
__label__de	So redet er eben.
__label__de	Forscher fanden heraus, dass der häufigste Grund für einen Abbruch in der Schwierigkeit bestand, ein Gleichgewicht zwischen der Arbeit und dem Studium zu finden.
__label__de	Dieses Neusprech ist ganz furchtbar. Eine Umerziehung findet hier statt.
__label__de	Sprich lauter, Tom. Ich versteh’ kein Wort.
__label__de	Tom fragte Maria, ob sie das schon mehr als einmal getan habe.
__label__de	Heuchler sind Leute, die andere für Handlungen anklagen, deren sie selber schuldig sind.
__label__de	Die Pfadfinderinnen haben Queen Latifah als Erzählerin für ein Video über namhafte Ehemalige – Venus Williams, Katie Couric u. v. a. – gewinnen können.
__label__de	Ich hab’s mir schon gedacht, dass ich euch zwei hier fände.
__label__de	Tom mag Pizza Hawaii nicht.
__label__de	Ich mag dich, aber nicht auf romantische Art und Weise.
__label__de	Tom konnte es kaum erwarten, die Kinder wiederzusehen.
__label__de	Niemand hätte irgend etwas tun können.
__label__de	Es schien Tom nicht zu freuen, Maria zu sehen.
__label__de	Meine Eltern sind sehr altmodisch.
__label__de	Die Mieten sind im Laufe der letzten 18 Jahre um 61 % gestiegen, die Löhne jüngerer Amerikaner jedoch nur um 31 %.
__label__de	Manchmal werden Kühe von Kojoten gerissen.
__label__de	Ich will einfach, dass du mich so nimmst, wie ich bin.
__label__de	Ich habe sehr altmodische Eltern.
__label__de	Wir haben das Recht zu streiken.
__label__de	Dieses Hemd ist mir zu groß. Haben Sie etwas Kleineres?
__label__de	Mein Esel ist schneller als dein Auto.
__label__de	Ich lerne lernen.
__label__de	Ich verabscheue Faulpelze.
__label__de	Es soll hier viele Füchse geben, aber ich habe selten einen zu Gesicht bekommen.
__label__de	Ich spreche nur ein bisschen Slowenisch.
__label__de	Ich spreche nur ein wenig Slowenisch.
__label__de	Wie viele Sätze hast du heute hinzugefügt?
__label__de	Diese Sprache wäre interessanter, wenn sie nicht so viele Beschränkungen hätte.
__label__de	Kannst du Tom daran erinnern, dass er noch ein paar Bücher von mir hat?
__label__de	Ich lebe auf dem Balkan.
__label__de	Ich lebe in Maribor.
__label__de	Jeder, der zum Schwert greift, wird durch das Schwert umkommen.
__label__de	Ich bin nicht wertlos.
__label__de	Oma kommt ja heute Nachmittag; deswegen habe ich Blumen gekauft.
__label__de	Mir ist nie langweilig.
__label__de	Mir ist nie langweilig. Ich finde immer eine Beschäftigung, und es ist ja auch immer etwas zu tun.
__label__de	Über meine Mutter weiß ich nichts; die lief weg, da war ich noch zu klein, um mich erinnern zu können.
__label__de	Dieser Mann ist ein begnadeter Erzähler. Egal, was er nacherzählt, Sagen des antiken Griechenland, biblische Geschichten, Stücke von Shakespeare, Märchen, das Nibelungenlied: er zieht einen in seinen Bann.
__label__de	Ich habe es in den Kühlschrank nicht gelegt.
__label__de	Ich habe sie in den Kühlschrank nicht gestellt.
__label__de	Unsere Katze kann Persisch.
__label__de	Diese Politiker sind dumm ohne Ende.
__label__de	Du hast dir etwas vorgenommen.
__label__de	Das Wesentliche ist für die Augen unsichtbar.
__label__de	Man sieht nur mit dem Herzen gut.
__label__de	Warum würdest du darüber lügen?
__label__de	Warum würdet ihr darüber lügen?
__label__de	Warum würden Sie darüber lügen?
__label__de	Ich hoffe, Thomas ist nicht verhaftet worden.
__label__de	Ich hoffe, dass Thomas nicht verhaftet worden ist.
__label__de	Es gibt keine Mutter, die ihren Sohn nicht liebte.
__label__de	Es gibt keine Mutter, die ihren Sohn nicht lieben würde.
__label__de	Sie hat eine gute Arbeit für ihn gefunden.
__label__de	Er hat eine gute Arbeit für sie gefunden.
__label__de	Ich habe mit Tom keine allzu gute Beziehung.
__label__de	Ich weiß selbst nicht, wozu ich das getan habe.
__label__de	Ich bin mir nicht sicher, ob wir genug Zeit haben.
__label__de	Die ersten Menschen lebten in Höhlen.
__label__de	Ich habe mich bei deinen Eltern nie wohlgefühlt.
__label__de	Vielleicht war es nur ein Albtraum.
__label__de	Ich war nicht am Zuhören.
__label__de	Ich bin Mitglied im Fitnessstudio.
__label__de	Das ist die beste Lösung.
__label__de	Hat Krümel sein Geschäft verrichtet?
__label__de	Das ist ein Dreieck.
__label__de	Kann ich meinen Aufenthalt um einen Tag verlängern?
__label__de	In dem überfüllten Bus war kein einziger Platz frei.
__label__de	Was möchtest du mal machen, wenn du deinen Abschluss in der Tasche hast?
__label__de	Das ist ein hoffnungsloser Fall.
__label__de	Die Tage kommen und gehen.
__label__de	Der Film weckte in Anna Sehnsüchte.
__label__de	Ich habe nicht mit ihm geschlafen.
__label__de	Zeit ist Gold.
__label__de	Musik ist mein Leben.
__label__de	Tom hat einen tragbaren Rechner.
__label__de	Im Leben gibt es alles.
__label__de	Aug um Auge, Zahn um Zahn.
__label__de	Ich habe diese Uhr von meinem Onkel geschenkt bekommen.
__label__de	Frag zwei Leute und du kriegst zwei Meinungen.
__label__de	Ich bin hier noch nicht gewesen.
__label__de	Er bereute nichts.
__label__de	Warum musst du so etwas sagen?
__label__de	Ich errötete, denn sie sah mich an.
__label__de	Tom hat den Pulitzer-Preis bekommen.
__label__de	Hier ist es. Verliere es nicht wieder!
__label__de	Tom und Maria eröffneten eine Bäckerei.
__label__de	Der Schnee glänzte.
__label__de	Strümpfe werden aufgehängt, dass der Weihnachtsmann sie in der Nacht fülle.
__label__de	Tom hat schon viele Medaillen gewonnen.
__label__de	Prince Charles ist der Thronfolger.
__label__de	Tom ist nicht mehr so schnell wie früher.
__label__de	Stehst du deinem Bruder nahe?

__label__de	Ich bin mit einem im Deutschland wohnhaften Amerikaner befreundet, der sich schlicht weigert, Englisch zu sprechen: wenn Deutsche oder selbst andere Amerikaner, die Deutsch verstehen, das Gespräch ins Englische ziehen wollen, lässt er sich nicht beirren und antwortet auf Deutsch. Dadurch hat er es erreicht, dass die Leute um ihn herum es normal finden, Deutsch mit ihm zu sprechen, obwohl er Amerikaner ist.

__label__de	Lichtstrahlen schienen durch die Wolken.
__label__de	Ihr Herz setzte einen Schlag aus.
__label__de	Tom kniete nieder und machte seiner Freundin einen Heiratsantrag.
__label__de	Ich kann nicht glauben, dass er tot ist.

__label__de	Wenn Sie hier falsche Angaben machen, werden Sie zur Rechenschaft gezogen.
__label__de	Ich habe auch keine Lust dazu, aber es muss fertiggemacht werden.
__label__de	Er hat noch nichts bezahlt.
__label__de	Wie viel kannst du jetzt bezahlen?
__label__de	Aug um Aug und Zahn um Zahn.

__label__de	Ein Apfel am Tag hält fern den Arzt, vorausgesetzt, man zielt richtig.
__label__de	Ich weine fast immer, wenn ich emotional werde.

__label__de	Welche Möglichkeiten haben wir?
__label__de	Ich spreche Indonesisch noch nicht fließend.
__label__de	„Wo ist die Toilette?“ – „Einmal nach hinten ganz durch und dann die Treppe runter.“
__label__de	Sie stand kurz davor, für immer von zu Hause wegzugehen.
__label__de	Dieses Lied ist herabsetzend gegenüber Frauen.
__label__de	Vor dreißig Jahren fegte ein verheerender Orkan über die schöne Stadt Charleston in South Carolina hinweg und zerstörte viele der historischen Häuser und Gebäude.
__label__de	„Hast du das gesehen?“ – „So klar, wie ich dich sehe.“
__label__de	Ich bin sehr glücklich, wenn ich bei dir bin.
__label__de	Emotional konnte sie ihre Tränen kaum verbergen.
__label__de	Maria sagt, dass sie sich einsam fühlt
__label__de	Ein Naturfreund ist, dessen innere und äußere Sinne noch aufeinander abgestimmt, der sich selbst im Erwachsenenalter noch ein kindlich Gemüt bewahrt. Mit dem Himmel und der Erde zu verkehren wird Teil seines täglich Brot.

__label__de	Dem Hubble-Teleskop haben wir erstaunliche Einblicke in das Universum zu verdanken: von den nächsten Planeten bis hin zu den entferntesten Galaxien, die wir je zu Gesicht bekommen haben.
__label__de	Der Grund, aus dem die 19jährige das Studium abbrach, ist der gleiche wie in den meisten der dörflichen Haushalte. „Ich musste meiner Mutter helfen, auf meine jüngeren Brüder aufzupassen, und Hausarbeit machen“, sagte Khan.
__label__de	Maria lächelte Tom an und dann er sie.
__label__de	„Lebst du noch?“ fragte Hans, an die abgeschlossene Badezimmertür klopfend. – „Ja, ich bin gleich fertig“, erwiderte Konstanze.

__label__de	Fick die Polizei!
__label__de	„Bist du sicher, dass du die Polizei rufen willst?“ fragte ich ihn.
__label__de	„Sind Sie sicher, dass Sie die Polizei rufen wollen?“ fragte ich ihn.
__label__de	Er ist heute in sehr guter Form.

__label__de	Er tat, was sie vorgeschlagen hatte.
__label__de	Tom hat früher immer seinen kleinen Bruder gequält.
__label__de	Man schreibe nicht sofort Boshaftigkeit und Grausamkeit zu, was in weniger kriminellen Motiven Erklärung findet. Denn setzt man anderen nicht oft zu, ohne dass man es gewollt hätte, und versäumt es nicht aus bloßer Unachtsamkeit, Leid zu lindern?
__label__de	Tom hat alle seine Hausaufgaben gemacht.
__label__de	Die Hochzeitsfeierlichkeiten dauerten acht Tage.

__label__de	Ich weiß, dass sie zustimmen wird.
__label__de	Ich habe eine Million Fragen. Alle werde ich dir heute nicht stellen können, aber ein paar.

Wenn man von diesen beiden jeweils einen so auswählen kann, dass jedes glatte Vektorfeld positiver Länge schon vollständig in diesen ausgewählten Kegeln liegt, wenn man das nur für einen einzigen Vektor weiß, dann nennt man (𝘔, 𝘨) zeitorientiert, und die (zeitartigen) Vektoren in den ausgewählten Kegeln heißen zukunftsweisend.

Partie der Weltmeisterschaft stand Nepo schon auf Gewinn und hätte dann nur noch ein Remis für den Titel gebraucht, aber in einem dramatischen Hin und Her, in dem beiden Spielern schwere Fehler unterliefen, hat er das Spiel doch noch aus der Hand gegeben und verloren – unglaublich bitter für ihn. Ding hingegen schaffte den Ausgleich auf 6½ : 6½.

__label__de	Demokratie in Deutschland funktioniert so, dass man zwar die Parteien und die Abgeordneten wählen darf, aber sobald die Parteien eine Regierung gebildet haben, brauchen diese für Beschlüsse nur noch eine Koalitionsmehrheit; dann gibt es eine Regierungsmehrheit, und die Mehrheitsmeinung in der Bevölkerung ist dabei völlig unerheblich. Oft setzt man sich sogar darüber hinweg, selbst wenn aus Umfragen hervorgeht, dass die meisten gegen eine Maßnahme sind.
__label__de	Wie kann es sein, dass in Deutschland immer wieder politische Maßnahmen durchgesetzt werden, selbst wenn eine Mehrheit der Bevölkerung dagegen ist? Wie demokratisch ist Deutschland?
__label__de	Mein Antivirus meint, das Programm könnte ein Trojaner sein.
__label__de	Er ist aus Schokolade und innen hohl.
__label__de	Der Hornochse stiert doch immer nur diese dumme Kuh an und hat kein Auge für mich übrig!
__label__de	Die Toilette spült automatisch.
__label__de	Ich will ja niemanden öffentlich an den Pranger stellen, aber ich glaube, ihr wisst sowieso alle, wer diesen Mist verbockt hat.
__label__de	Diese sogenannten Experten liegen mit ihren Prognosen so oft daneben, dass ich einfach keine mehr hören will.
__label__de	Ich empfinde nicht einmal Freude darüber, dass der jetzt weg ist; der ist mir einfach egal.
__label__de	Ich weiß nicht, ob ich dich deswegen bewundern oder sogar beneiden sollte; jedenfalls finde ich es faszinierend, dass dir das alles so egal ist, was hier passiert. Ich wünschte, es ließe mich so kalt wie dich!
__label__de	In einer Welt voller Heiliger gäbe es keine Politiker mehr.
__label__de	Ich gehe nicht jedesmal ans Telefon, wenn es klingelt.
__label__de	Wählt Cthulhu!
__label__de	Schön, dass Sie unsere Fragen beantworten möchten.
__label__de	Er hat geliebt und dabei sich selbst gefunden. Die meisten aber lieben, um sich dabei zu verlieren.
__label__de	Ich bin verliebt und verwirrt.
__label__de	Tante Emilie wird ihn wegschicken und nie wieder mit ihm sprechen.
__label__de	Wissenschaftler besuchen die Antarktis, um Pinguine zu studieren.
__label__de	Tom sah sich den Zugfahrplan an.
__label__de	Gewohnheit ist eine zweite Natur.
__label__de	Sei zufrieden mit deinem Schicksal.
__label__de	Ich finde nicht, dass wir jemanden bevorzugt behandeln sollten, nur weil er eine Frau oder ein Mann ist. Warum können wir nicht endlich aufhören, immer wieder die Geschlechtszugehörigkeit zu thematisieren, und anfangen, in jedem schlichtweg einen gleichberechtigten Menschen zu sehen?
__label__de	Die Tür ist aus Holz.
__label__de	Die Tür ist aus Holz gemacht.
__label__de	Hast du alles gelesen?
__label__de	Wer ist durstig?
__label__de	Sie hatte Durst.
__label__de	Sie war durstig.
__label__de	Wir haben Durst.
__label__de	Seid ihr durstig?
__label__de	Bist du nicht durstig?
__label__de	Sie sind hungrig.
__label__de	Wir werden nicht aufhören!
__label__de	Wer weiß.
__label__de	Wer weiß das schon.
__label__de	Ich war im Park, um mir Blumen anzusehen.
__label__de	Tom hat nie ein Wort darüber gesagt.
__label__de	Der Kater ist tot.
__label__de	Die Lawine hat auf ihrem Weg alles mitgerissen.
__label__de	Tom hat eigentlich recht.
__label__de	Tom hat nicht ganz unrecht.
__label__de	Ich glaube, hier drehen so langsam alle durch.
__label__de	Alle suchen Tom.
__label__de	Alle suchten Tom.
__label__de	Alle waren auf der Suche nach Tom.
__label__de	Die Sonne schien.
__label__de	Wer hätte das für möglich gehalten?
__label__de	Verschwindet aus meinem Bett.
__label__de	Bitte adoptiere mich!
__label__de	Bitte adoptiert mich!
__label__de	Bitte adoptieren Sie mich!
__label__de	Ich habe sie den ganzen Tag nicht gesehen.
__label__de	Er diente seinem Herrn gut.
__label__de	Die sollen nicht aufgeben!
__label__de	Ich warte vor dem Restaurant.
__label__de	Das Match spiegelt das Tiefste meiner Seele wider.
__label__de	Ich bin wohl im falschen Zeitalter geboren.
__label__de	Betrifft es mich?
__label__de	Woher wissen Sie, dass es wahr ist?
__label__de	Tom konnte ohne seinen Hund nirgendwohin gehen.
__label__de	Mineralwasser, bitte.
__label__de	Schau, ein Eichhörnchen!
__label__de	Schau, eine Gämse!
__label__de	Siehst du die Gämse?
__label__de	Betrifft mich das?
__label__de	Ich kann es nicht fassen, dass du mit Maria Schluss gemacht hast.
__label__de	Wie kommst du darauf, dass ich mit dir befreundet wäre?
__label__de	Dieses Jahr war eine Achterbahnfahrt für mich.
__label__de	Mir gefällt mein Leben so, wie es ist.
__label__de	Tom musste nicht lange überzeugt werden.
__label__de	Tom wollte danach nichts mehr mit mir zu tun haben.
__label__de	Kaffee, bitte.
__label__de	Einen Kaffee mit Milch, bitte!
__label__de	Warte noch kurz. Ich habe eine Frage.
__label__de	Man bekommt Füchse so selten zu sehen, weil sie meistens nachtaktiv sind.
__label__de	Heutzutage töte ich nicht einmal mehr eine Fliege. Ich habe viele getötet, als ich ein Kind war.
__label__de	Sie wurde geboren, um mich glücklich zu machen.
__label__de	Mögest du recht haben!
__label__de	Ich kann nicht für möglich halten, dass die unermessliche Macht, die wir Gott nennen, so viele Milliarden verschiedener Lebewesen ohne jeden Zweck (nur zum Spaß?) geschaffen hat.
__label__de	Die lateinische Sprache ist in Tatoeba lebendig.
__label__de	Stimmt es, dass der Kunde immer recht hat?
__label__de	Ich weiß nicht immer, wovon ich rede, aber ich weiß, dass ich recht habe.
__label__de	Nachts sind Füchse gut an ihrem buschigen Schwanz zu erkennen.
__label__de	Dies ist ein Frosch.
__label__de	Es ist ein Frosch.
__label__de	Der Frühling ist grün.
__label__de	Das Frühjahr ist grün.
__label__de	Es nähert sich die Wintersonnenwende.
__label__de	„Du hast ja recht, aber ...“ – ich weiß nicht, wie oft ich diesen Satz schon gehört habe.
__label__de	Eigentlich hast du ja recht, aber ich bleibe trotzdem bei meiner Meinung.
__label__de	Eigentlich ist es ja so, wie du sagst, aber ich mache trotzdem weiter wie bisher.
__label__de	In einer Welt, in der nur noch Clowns unterwegs sind, bleibt einem nichts anderes übrig, als selber Clown zu sein.
__label__de	Wenn alles wie am Schnürchen ginge, gäbe es nichts mehr, worüber man sich aufregen könnte.
__label__de	Diese Art von Stoff ist sowohl billig als auch robust.
__label__de	Ich war hungrig wie ein Wolf.
__label__de	Es war eigentlich ganz einfach!
__label__de	Deine Tränen werden ihn nicht ewig zurückhalten.
__label__de	Durch den Wald fließt ein seichter Bach.
__label__de	Mann muss nicht immer alles neu erfinden.
__label__de	Mögest du recht behalten!
__label__de	Meine Urgroßonkel sind beide im Krieg von 39-45 gestorben. Der eine war Franzose und der andere Deutscher.
__label__de	Könnte es Mord gewesen sein?
__label__de	Dass Sie über mein Buch nachdenken, stellt eine Verletzung meines Urheberrechtes dar.
__label__de	Ich werde mich um das Problem kümmern.
__label__de	Jemand will dich umbringen.
__label__de	Jemand will euch umbringen.
__label__de	Jemand will Sie umbringen.
__label__de	Man will dich umbringen.
__label__de	Man will euch umbringen.
__label__de	Man will Sie umbringen.
__label__de	Hat die jemand gesehen?
__label__de	Er stellte sich vor dem Zubettgehen den Wecker.
__label__de	Balaschicha ist eine schöne Stadt 20 km östlich von Moskau.
__label__de	Ich wollte nicht, dass du mich siehst.
__label__de	Sie hat schöne Kostüme für den Film entworfen.
__label__de	Ich will nicht den Rest meines Lebens hier verbringen.
__label__de	Er spielte seine höchste Karte.
__label__de	Die Bevölkerung wächst einfach immer weiter.
__label__de	Mir gefällt überhaupt nicht, dass die ohne uns gehen.
__label__de	Sie kann meine Videokamera nehmen, wenn sie möchte.
__label__de	Freunde kann man gar nicht vorsichtig genug auswählen.
__label__de	Sie zog sich den Ring vom Finger.
__label__de	Er wohnt zur Zeit bei seinem Onkel.
__label__de	Gebt der Regierung eine Chance!
__label__de	Jeder Tag hat 86 400 Sekunden.
__label__de	Wir sollten hier warten.
__label__de	Sie hat nicht auf ihn gewartet.
__label__de	Die Ergebnisse sind da.
__label__de	Wie ist das Bewerbungsgespräch gelaufen?
__label__de	Da können wir nicht langfahren! Da ist ein Rechtsabbiegen-verboten-Schild.
__label__de	Bitte fragen Sie mich nicht.
__label__de	Sie hasst ihre Schwiegermutter.
__label__de	Dieses Buch ist sehr brauchbar.
__label__de	Du hast deinen Standpunkt und ich habe meinen Standpunkt. Anscheinend unterscheiden sich beide.
__label__de	Ich habe meine Schlüssel und meine Jungfräulichkeit verloren.
__label__de	Das Genie muss man nicht verstehen, nur respektieren.
__label__de	Welche Website besuchst du am häufigsten?
__label__de	Welche Website besucht ihr am häufigsten?
__label__de	Welche Website besuchen Sie am häufigsten?
__label__de	Sie dachte über ihren nächsten Zug nach.
__label__de	Ich wurde müde und beschloss, mich kurz aufs Ohr zu hauen.
__label__de	Was hättest du anders gemacht?
__label__de	Was hättet ihr anders gemacht?
__label__de	Was hätten Sie anders gemacht?
__label__de	Was würdet ihr anders machen?
__label__de	Was würden Sie anders machen?
__label__de	Er hat BWL studiert.
__label__de	Ich habe eine letzte Frage an dich.
__label__de	Ich habe eine letzte Frage an euch.
__label__de	Ich habe eine letzte Frage an Sie.
__label__de	Die haben die Bücher, die ich ihnen geliehen habe, noch immer.
__label__de	Irgendwie verrät das, was wir sagen, immer, was wir fühlen.
__label__de	Was willst du mit der Liste?
__label__de	Wer keine Tiere mag, mag auch keine Menschen.
__label__de	Johannes beschloss, Jessica zu bitten, mit ihm zu lernen.
__label__de	In der Höhle haust ein Obdachloser.
__label__de	Warum ist die Wahrheit wichtig?
__label__de	Sie sollte bleiben, wo sie ist.
__label__de	Alle zeigen mit dem Finger auf mich.
__label__de	Emilie hat ein schönes Gesicht.
__label__de	Constanze ist unglaublich dick, aber sie hat ein hübsches Gesicht.
__label__de	Kannst du mir beibringen, wie man einen Schlips bindet?
__label__de	Niemand bewundert ihn mehr als ich.
__label__de	Geh weg und lass mich in Ruhe!
__label__de	Pass auf, dass sie nicht schwanger wird!
__label__de	Ich wusste, dass du nicht entlassen würdest.
__label__de	Wenn einem von jemandem, der nicht weiß, woher man kommt, gesagt wird, man klinge wie ein Muttersprachler, dann heißt das, dass dem an der Art, wie man redet, irgendwas aufgefallen sein muss, woran er erkannt hat, dass man eben keiner ist. Anders ausgedrückt klingt man eher nicht wie ein Muttersprachler.
__label__de	Sami hätte fast gekotzt.
__label__de	Vergiss nicht, mich morgen anzurufen!
__label__de	Wir haben nicht genug Freunde.
__label__de	Sie haben ein falsches Passwort eingegeben.
__label__de	Ich schlage Ihnen heute ein anderes Experiment vor.
__label__de	Wie schwierig das ist!
__label__de	Für alles muss es einen Begriff geben.
__label__de	Du bist nicht verpflichtet, deine Arbeit fertig zu machen.
__label__de	Der Übersetzer hat einen unverzeihlichen Fehler gemacht.
__label__de	Beim Übersetzen muss man mit aller Strenge vorgehen und darf keinen Respekt vor dem Original haben.
__label__de	Er hat neun Jahrzehnte lang gelebt.
__label__de	Sich zu verspäten ist unhöflich.
__label__de	Hat euch das Essen geschmeckt?
__label__de	Schmeckte Ihnen das Essen?
__label__de	Schmeckte euch das Essen?
__label__de	„Ich komme zurück“, sagte Tom.
__label__de	Iss etwas.
__label__de	Tom hat Mary nicht alles erzählt.
__label__de	Tom erzählte Mary nicht alles.
__label__de	Die, die den Schafen folgen, sind selbst Schafe.
